Topics covered include how beliefs about health, disease and the body are constructed and transmitted, how healers are chosen and trained, social disparities in health and illness, and the importance of narrative and performance in the effectiveness of healing practices. Finally, we will consider the ways in which medical anthropology can shed light upon important contemporary medical and social concerns.",

How to analyze the different identities, spaces, and subjectivities that are being constituted under changing economic, social, and political conditions? In this seminar, we read ethnographies from and about cities around the globe and analyze how scholars, particularly anthropologists, have studied cities, their cultures, and social groups. We pay attention to the forces (such as neoliberalism, modernism, nationalism, and globalization) and inequalities (such as class, race, and gender) that shape urban life. The texts we read explore current pressing issues such as poverty, violence, policing, gentrification, and homelessness. Alongside our investigation of city life, students also will have the opportunity to develop their skills in ethnographic research methods by closely analyzing how different authors accessed and wrote about cities as well as by conducting their own mini-ethnographies.",

As indicated by the metaphor the new Civil War, however, the conflicts seemingly coming to a head in the present point not only to the return of war to the homeland but also to the ways in which home, to begin with, is a place of war. This course charts the history of U.S. wars through literary and cultural texts to study not only the wages of armed conflict but also the constitutive role of organized violence in American culture. This war culture is often attributed to the American Revolution, but in fact the most enduring texts of the time emphasize ideas over violence while tackling the complexity of independence. We will follow the persistence of this intellectual and critical spirit in accounts of U.S. wars-from the Civil War to the two World Wars to the Korean War to the Vietnam War to the War on Terror-to study not only war itself but also the culture of which it is an index: the war beyond/before the war. In reading about war, we will also consider how it has been countered through writing to learn how to be better writers ourselves, in hopes that persuasive argumentation is an antidote to war. Readings may include poetry from the American Revolution, the Civil War, and the Vietnam War, The Unvanquished, Company K, Hiroshima, The Surrendered, Platoon, Apocalypse Now, The Face of War, We Should Never Meet, The Forever War, and The Undertow: Scenes from a Slow Civil War.",

Others visualize apocalypses that had yet to take place, like the prophecies of earthly destruction that inspired Nat Turner''s and John Brown''s revolts against slavery.
