This advanced studio art course will focus on the contemporary state of fine art print media and explore innovative and experimental approaches to print that expand the notions and practice of the traditional medium. Throughout the semester, students will be introduced to experimental printmaking techniques and alternative approaches to print that seek to blur the boundaries between printmaking, photography, drawing, and installation. The course will focus on both individual and group projects that explore ways in which the studio and printing process can be used as a means of dissemination, collaboration, and social engagement.

In particular, the course explores three features of behavior that are de-emphasized in neoclassical economics: bounded rationality, bounded willpower, and bounded self-interest (social preferences). Bounded rationality implies that individuals have limited information-processing capabilities and, as a result, rely on simple heuristics (\"rules of thumb\") to make decisions. While useful, heuristics can lead to biased probability judgments, overconfidence, status quo bias, loss aversion, and other behaviors that influence economic outcomes. People exhibit bounded willpower when they make decisions that are dynamically inconsistent and in conflict with their long-term well-being (e.g., procrastination, under-saving, addiction, etc.). A focus on social preferences asks us to consider how concerns about fairness might influence labor market outcomes and trust affects the gains from trade and economic growth. By developing models based on realistic assumptions about human behavior, behavioral economists hope to design better institutions and policies to reduce poverty, limit environmental degradation, promote financial and macroeconomic stability, and solve other problems confronting the world.

In order to understand this relationship, this course will explore changing historical conceptions of what it means to do science, where it can be done, who gets to participate, what ethical considerations should govern its conduct, and even what kinds of questions science can answer. We will consider human beings as students and practitioners of science, but also as subjects of scientific inquiry. While we will consider science around the world, our focus will be on science in the West. We cannot possibly consider every place, space, and discipline of science in one semester, but we will consider a variety of case studies, and you will have the opportunity to supplement our work with your own research.

Through translating sentences and basic texts, we will experience first-hand the classical form of the language used for writing everything from business receipts and letters, to historical documents and literary works, to esoteric theological texts which record details of their belief system. Topics to be covered are the origins of writing in Egypt, historical development of the language, daily religion, beliefs in the afterlife, the family, social structure, literature and the role of writing in Egyptian culture. From students of archaeology or linguistics, history or modern languages, or anyone who has ever seen an artifact from Ancient Egypt and wanted to know what the hieroglyphs say, this class has something for everyone! No prior knowledge of ancient Egypt or Egyptian language is needed or required, only a desire to gain insight into the thoughts of people who lived thousands of years ago.    Offered Occasionally."

The sociological study of disability examines the commonalities of social life that exist and persist, despite the presence of biological differences. Additionally, it encourages critical evaluation of the influence of social systems, institutions, professional understandings of disability, and our own assumptions about the disability experience on the well being of people with disabilities and members of their families. Students will examine disability through understandings of identity (personal and collective), inequalities, social movements, social experience, sexualities, gender, race, class, intersectionalities, and physical and mental variation. We will examine the ways in which people with bodily and mental differences construct personal and collective identities and develop, support, and maintain communities; the effects of stigma on experiences of disability; and how disability is constructed by the cultural and structural demands of global capitalist societies. We will also explore the ways in which the experience of disability and disability studies can be used to further sociological understandings and to reexamine and reconceptualize taken-for-granted ideas about social life and experience, the social structure, and sociological theories and methodology.

Even with advanced linguistic proficiency, we can experience breakdowns in communication or even offend others if we are unaware of the cultural norms and perspectives that govern how to use linguistic forms appropriately in different situations. Thus, the objective of this course is to equip students with the linguistic and cultural knowledge they need to use Spanish appropriately in real and meaningful contexts. To do so, students will analyze how culturally-confined politeness norms, contextual elements, and speakers' identities impact how language is used to carry out different speech acts such as requests, invitations, and apologies, among others. Furthermore, students will compare variation in pragmatic norms among different Spanish and American English-speaking communities and reflect upon how cultural perspectives and identities influence how we do things with words.

More specifically, what is the role of the principal in ensuring they lead a school whereas all of their students can achieve the highest levels of academic success? What is the role of principal in creating and building a school community focused on continual reflection and improvement?  With that, we will explore educational leadership via a cognitive approach grounded in the following three elements: (1) Socio-cognitive leadership  - A shared cognitive approach to decision making present in schools that have successfully closed achievement gaps. (2) The Dimensions of Leadership for Learning  - Where school principals focus their time and attention as a catalyst for student improvement. (3)Levers of Change  - The individual, organizational, and community levers that master principals use to further the Dimensions of Leadership for Learning (Kelly & Shaw, 2009).   In addition to a focus on socio-cognitive leadership, learners will consider the balance between the symbolic and technical sides of educational leadership.  Finally, the concept of educational leadership will be grounded in conversations related to the importance of principal professional development to include the importance of personal development and personal satisfaction.

All cases will include critical thinking skills that will be required by practicing therapists in today's health care arena as well as enable students to explore issues important to the practice of occupational therapy (i.e. the occupational therapy process, evaluation, evidence-based intervention, theory/models/frames of reference, ethical issues, and justification of services.) Additionally, students will explore emerging market areas of interest in the OT profession and share with peers to advocate for change in service delivery in the health care system.
