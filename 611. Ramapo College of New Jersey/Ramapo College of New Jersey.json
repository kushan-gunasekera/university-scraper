Into the eastern vacuum arose a different religious entity, Islam; it, too, presented a values structure similar to that of Catholicism. Eventually, these two religious entities would clash. But before that occurred, east and west had to develop their own characters. For Europe, this meant the rise of the Franks and eventually of their leader, Charlemagne. From his reign came the modern division of western European countries.

        "course_description": "\"In the year 1348, one that I deplore, we were deprived not only of our friends, but of peoples throughout the world.\" So wrote the poet and scholar Petrarch in a famous letter regarding one of the most infamous pandemics in history, the Black Death. Although the Black Death has certainly loomed large in the history of Medieval Europe, recent scholars in multiple fields have challenged traditional narratives by putting the Black Death into a global context. This course\u00a0examines the Black Death from a global and multi-disciplinary perspective. What can paleo-biology tell us about the spread of plague across Eurasia and Africa? How have archaeologists tried to assess the impact of plague in Sub-Saharan Africa? How have Chinese texts forced historians to readdress the timing of the Black Death? How did Middle Eastern societies deal with plague both legally and theologically? Did the Black Death drastically alter the course\u00a0of European history? The\u00a0course addresses these questions and more in pursuit of understanding the Black Death as a true pandemic."

Ultimately, the soldiers would achieve their goals: capturing Jerusalem, reclaiming the Holy Land, and establishing a number of crusader kingdoms. Their expedition would also set the stage for centuries of warfare between those crusaders (and their descendants) and forces, largely Islamic, which also held claim to the Holy Land. Students study the early history of the Crusades, from both the Christian and non-Christian view, as well as their effect on the early modern and modern history of the world."

Into the eastern vacuum arose a different religious entity, Islam; it, too, presented a values structure similar to that of Catholicism. Eventually, these two religious entities would clash. But before that occurred, east and west had to develop their own characters. For Europe, this meant the rise of the Franks and eventually of their leader, Charlemagne. From his reign came the modern division of western European countries.

Although the Black Death has certainly loomed large in the history of Medieval Europe, recent scholars in multiple fields have challenged traditional narratives by putting the Black Death into a global context. This course\u00a0examines the Black Death from a global and multi-disciplinary perspective. What can paleo-biology tell us about the spread of plague across Eurasia and Africa? How have archaeologists tried to assess the impact of plague in Sub-Saharan Africa? How have Chinese texts forced historians to readdress the timing of the Black Death? How did Middle Eastern societies deal with plague both legally and theologically? Did the Black Death drastically alter the course\u00a0of European history? The\u00a0course addresses these questions and more in pursuit of understanding the Black Death as a true pandemic."

Core questions include: How has racial thought and ideas about race shaped ideas about childhood and children? How does race determine who gets to be considered a child? How has race and ethnicity shaped children's lives? What does the history of childhood tell us about race in the U.S.? How have children come to form a racial identity or understand race? The course also examines how structural (i.e. the legal system, policy, education) inequality and racial thought worked in tandem to shape our ever-evolving cultural understanding and experiences of American childhood."

Through books, articles, films, and primary sources, students study how laws and crime have shaped people's understandings of politics, morality, and social relationships. Understanding the factors that bring people into contact with the law, as well as their perceptions of it, will elucidate how racism, sexism, and poverty determine people's paths to crime. In turn, deconstructing laws and social norms will elucidate some of the ways governments and elites maintain power. As the relationship between laws, crime, and power is reconceptualized, students may begin to rethink how they study the past."

Few realize that the American Revolutionary War stretched from Lexington to Jamaica to Senegal and to India. This course explores the American Revolution in its global context. Students look at some familiar events (the Boston Massacre), but from new perspectives (those of the Irish soldiers stationed in Boston in 1770) as well Revolutionary events in some less familiar places (North American borderlands, the Caribbean, England, and India). Students explore some of the outcomes of the war for diverse groups, including runaway African American slaves who ultimately found themselves in Canada, London, Sierra Leone, and Australia. Throughout the course, students explore how and why events in places like Massachusetts produced a conflict that played out across the globe."

The sources reviewed in this course come from\u00a0narrative histories by participants and witnesses, public and private art and architecture, official and personal epitaphs, and love poetry. Monuments to wartime and to peace itself were significant (as they are for us). Topics studied include\u00a0alliances, puppet rulers, corruption, depiction of defeated foes, \"peace through conquest\" ideology, and changes for conquerors and conquered."

        "course_description": "Studying works of art inevitably brings up philosophical questions about the nature of art and the status of aesthetic judgments. Is art just about emotion and not reason? Is art basically subjective? Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? Conversely, the philosophy of art must grapple with the acute particularity of artworks, and efforts to probe art in the realm of ideas are inescapably freighted by the objects themselves and the history of art. How is form related to meaning? What is modernism? What is the future of art? In short, art history and philosophy of art need each other, and students need both to fully pursue fundamental questions about the role of art in human life. This course brings abstract theorizing together with contextualized case studies, allowing students to develop nuanced perspectives on our modes of thinking about art and our cultural practices of making, exchanging, and experiencing artworks."

What are some macro and micro policy interventions that academics and policy-makers can design to reduce corruption, improve governance, and further development? These are some of the central questions that the field of political economy of development seeks to answer and hence are major topics of this course. Particular attention is given to the developing regions of Africa, Latin America, and South Asia."

        "course_description": "Popular movements and protests mobilize aggrieved citizens under repressive authoritarian regimes but they face a number of obstacles to success. Activists seek to fashion slogans that resonate with the discontented, employ new communication technologies to outflank regime controls, and draw supporters from the existing collectives in society. What explains how these movements get off the ground, how they develop over time, and what outcomes they achieve? Students examine the challenges of high-risk activism in authoritarian regimes by drawing on cases from different time periods and regions of the world: the Arab Spring in the Middle East, a major movement in China or Hong Kong, and the mobilizations in Eastern Europe that sparked the fall of Communism, among others."

We also investigate why some African countries, such as Botswana or Mauritius, are much more developed and democratic than others, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. In order to answer these questions, we examine Africa's political and economic history in the twentieth century, including colonialism, because such an examination is fundamental to make sense of current events in Africa ranging from Chinese investment to electoral results."

While some level of economic inequality is inherent and even desirable in a capitalistic economy, many scholars believe that the level of inequality that prevails in the U.S. erodes generalized levels of trust, poisons interpersonal relationships, and ultimately makes it far more difficult to govern a democratic society. This course examines the roots of American economic inequality, with a tight focus on how laws adopted through democratic processes have resulted in a huge transfer of wealth from the hands of the many to the hands of the few."

Did Socrates deserve his hemlock for sowing disunity in a time of trouble, or was he the tragically unheeded voice of reasoned rehabilitation? Readings from ancient authors Plato, Aristotle, and Thucydides, alongside moderns including Mill, Nietzsche, Rousseau."

What are the possibilities, limits, and future of collective contention in China today? Although the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is ruled by an authoritarian single party-state, citizens, farmers, students, workers, and others have devised multiple strategies to make their collective voices heard, often outside official channels of political participation. This course aims to get a sense of the rapidly emerging field of collective resistance in China by surveying recent scholarship on protestors of all types in the early twenty-first century. Whether China faces a large-scale revolution similar to the one that brought the CCP to power or whether it repeatedly endures small-scale protests that act as \"pressure valves\" to release the frustration is an open question."

Students also become familiar with major themes, values, and concerns in Chinese culture, and they are able to apply appropriate methodologies and approaches for critical analysis of cultural texts. Keeping a reflective journal each week, students present the journal portfolio as part of the final project."

Without exception, the persons studied are integral to universal Catholicism and can accurately be called re-formers of the Church. Profoundly involved with the ideas, issues, movements, and crises of their time, they exerted an extraordinary influence on contemporaries, becoming in the process exemplars for future generations of Catholics.

Why have Catholics, Orthodox, and Protestants disagreed over purgatory and prayers for the dead? What end does God intend for the world, and how can this end justify hope in a world so deeply wounded by our own indifference and despair, wars, and deaths? Traditional and contemporary books on these issues are read; students, as individuals and a group, develop their own answers to these questions as they learn the answers of others."

A shift of this magnitude invites philosophical reflection: both historical and phenomenological reflections on the nature of reading, writing, and thinking as well as a general examination of the way media affects consciousness. In this course, students trace the history of media shifts and their impact by looking at thinkers as diverse as Plato and Marshall McLuhan. Special attention is given to reflection on the internet and social media, with readings from earliest theorists of the internet such as Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson and contemporary critiques of the internet such as Nicholas Carr, author of \"Is Google Making Us Stupid?\""

Is art just about emotion and not reason? Is art basically subjective? Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? Conversely, the philosophy of art must grapple with the acute particularity of artworks, and efforts to probe art in the realm of ideas are inescapably freighted by the objects themselves and the history of art. How is form related to meaning? What is modernism? What is the future of art? In short, art history and philosophy of art need each other, and students need both to fully pursue fundamental questions about the role of art in human life. This course brings abstract theorizing together with contextualized case studies, allowing students to develop nuanced perspectives on our modes of thinking about art and our cultural practices of making, exchanging, and experiencing artworks."

Research demonstrates that there is a significant gap between how businesses believe they perform and consumer perceptions about how well they deliver against customer needs. Customers' journeys now have so many touchpoints across both digital and traditional channels, designing and delivering great experiences for customers is more complex and challenging than ever. To make matters even more complicated, customers' expectations are constantly evolving making it imperative that companies continually update their understanding of their customers by deliberately and continually collecting and interpreting customer data. In this class, students learn strategies (e.g.,\u00a0observational and survey research design and analysis) to help managers stay\u00a0informed about customers' perceptions and expectations. Students learn about\u00a0designing great experiences by understanding how to use\u00a0virtual/physical environment,\u00a0process design, and managing people to deliver excellence in service. Finally, understanding the outcomes of great customer experiences such as customer loyalty, net promoter scores, referrals, and word of mouth are covered.\u00a0As a part of this course, this class evaluates a real-world company and the customer experience it delivers."
