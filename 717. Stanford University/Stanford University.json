This seminar will take an anthropological look at both the modernity and the compulsions of ethnic allegiance, and, why struggles over ethnic identity are so frequently violent. Our questions will be both historical; how, why and when did people come to think of themselves as possessing different ethnic identities - and contemporary; how are these identities lived, understood, narrated, and transformed and what is the consequence of such ethnicisation. nWe follow this through anthropological perspectives which ask persistently how people themselves locally narrate and act upon their experiences and histories. Through this we will approach some of the really big and yet everyday questions that many of us around the world face: how do we relate to ourselves and to those we define as others; and how do we live through and after profound violence? The seminar will take these larger questions through a global perspective focusing on cases from Rwanda and Burundi, India, Sri Lanka, Northern Ireland, Guatemala, and the countries of Former Yugoslavia among others. These cases cover a broad canvas of issues from questions of historicity, racial purity, cultural holism, and relations to the state, to contests over religious community, indigeneity, minority identities, globalization, gender, and generation.",

How do people who live at the extremes of American society- the super rich, the working poor and those who live on the margins, imagine and experience \"the good life\"? How do we understand phenomena such as gang cultures, addiction and the realignment of white consciousness? This class uses the methods and modes of ethnographic study in an examination of American culture. Ethnographic materials range from an examination of the new American wealth boom of the last 20 years (Richistan by Robert Frank) to the extreme and deadlynworld of the invisible underclass of homeless addicts on the streets of San Francisco (Righteous Dopefiend by Phillipe Bourgois and Jeff Schonberg). The experiences of Hispanic immigrants and the struggle to escape gang life in Los Angeles are highlighted in the story of Homeboy Industries a job creation program initiated by a priest working in LA's most deadly neighborhoods (G-Dog and the Homeboys by Celeste Fremon). Finally in Searching for Whitopia: an improbable journeyninto the heart of White America, Rich Benjamin explores the creation on ethnic enclaves (whitopias) as fear over immigration and the shrinking white majority redefine race consciousnessnin the 21st century. Each of these narratives provides a window into the various ways in which Americans approach the subjects of wealth and the good life, poverty and the underclass, and thenconstruction of class, race, and gender in American society.

Lord Rayleigh called the method \u00bfThe Great Principle of Similitude.\u00bf On its surface, it is a look at the relationships between physical quantities which uses their basic \u00bfunits\u00bf. In fact, it is a powerful and formalized method to analyze complex physical phenomena, including those for which we cannot pose, much less solve, governing equations. The method is also valuable to engineers and scientist as it helps perform back-of-the-envelope estimates and derive scaling laws for the design of machines and processes. The principle has been applied successfully to the study of complex phenomena in biology, aerodynamics, chemistry, sports, astrophysics, and forensics, among other areas. In this course, the students will be provided with the basic tools to perform such flexible and powerful analyses. We will then review particular example analyses. These will include estimating the running speed of a hungry tyrannosaurus rex, a comparison of the flights of mosquitos and jet airliners, the cost of submarines, and the energy released by an atomic weapon. We will then work together as a class to identify problems in everyday life and/or current world events to analyze with this powerful tool.",

Drexler's thesis sparked the imagination of what nano machinery might do, whereas Crichton's popular novel channeled the public's attention to this subject by portraying a disastrous scenario of a technology gone astray.

From humble beginnings, humans have gone on to be become the ecologically dominant species in most biomes and grown to a global population in excess of seven billion. This dominance arises from a combination of features of the human organism including its extreme degree of behavioral flexibility and flexible social organization. The prima facie evidence of human evolutionary and ecological success raises a paradox with respect to recent work in economics and psychology which increasingly argues for pervasive irrationality in human decision-making in a wide array of behavioral contexts. How is it possible for an organism with such seemingly flawed software supporting decision-making to become the globally dominant species? We will use this contradiction as the launching point for understanding what rationality means in a broad ecological and cross-cultural context. What do we mean by `rationality\u00bf? How do different disciplines conceive of rationality in different ways? Is there such a thing as a rationality that transcends cultural differences or is the very idea of rationality a cultural construction that is used to justify imperialism and other modes of paternalism? Are there systematic factors that promote or impede rational decision-making? The seminar will provide a gentle introduction to the formal approaches of decision theory which we will apply to an unusual array of topics centered on the subsistence and reproductive decisions of hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, pastoralists, and agrarian peasants, in short, people living in face-to-face, subsistence societies. In addition to doing reading from a broad array of social and natural science disciplines around the topic of rationality, students will regularly engage in exercises to assess their own approaches to decision-making.",

Our growing appreciation in the social sciences and humanities of the agency, polyvalence and catalytic role of things has given rise to The New Materialist and Post-Humanist movements, which in turn raise questions about intra-action and observational perspective that are echoed in the modern physical and life sciences. In this class we will explore these theoretical convergences in considering themes such as `things-in-themselves\u00bf, networks and open systems, assemblages and entanglements. We will also examine specific examples such as oil, metal (guns), dams, viruses, electricity, mushrooms; each thing will be explored both in terms of its social and ethical entanglements and in terms of its material properties and affordances. There will also be hands-on encounters with objects in labs and a couple of local field trips. The key question throughout will be `why and how does matter matter in society today?",

Some are well-known historical events, while others are less obvious, but all have a strategic lesson to share. They are quite diverse, from the planning of a high-risk rescue in the Colorado Rockies, to a product crisis in a Fortune 50 company, to a little-known failed military mission of WWII, to a commercial airline disaster. The ability to think through challenging and varied scenarios is both instructive and mind-stretching. There will be some pre-reading on each case study and there may be a field trip for students to put their lessons into practice. The course is designed to be highly interactive; all to enable students to unravel the mystery and power of strategic thinking. Students will also have the opportunity to select and analyze a case reflecting interests of their own.

It is designed to help you understand, shape, and lead your organization's strategy by providing you with a framework for thinking about the issues that shape your organization's economic prosperity. In addition to an analytical framework, the course will provide you with insight into the process of formulating and assessing strategy for roles with cross-functional responsibility at all levels. The emphasis will be on how to articulate what the organization's strategy is, how to create alignment between the strategy, organizational design, and market environment, and the process of growing, managing and transforming organizations. The course is particularly well suited for students who have limited exposure to strategic analysis and/or who anticipate pursuing roles with primary responsibility for the success of products and services in both new and established organizations.",

Initially, entrepreneurial companies grow by discovering product-market fit, and then capitalize on that discovery by aligning their strategy and organization to their environment. As they mature, established companies grow by innovating anew, exploring possibilities and changing their organizations into new alignments with new opportunities. This course covers how leaders shape the process of discovery, change, and growth, and how strategy and organization combine to scale success. The course is geared toward students who seek to become entrepreneurs, students who want to join a growing firm in a strategic role, and for students who want to innovate to create new growth opportunities in an established firm.",

Right now, you probably don't spend much time thinking about the way you communicate, nor are you likely, in the academic setting, to get much feedback on the messages you send. Yet the quality of your communication will have a large impact on your overall effectiveness in building relationships and getting things done, both in the university setting and later in your career. Each of the sessions in our seminar will help you appreciate the nature and complexity of communication and provide guidelines for both improving your communication style and recognizing the unique styles of others.In each class session, we'll consider a number of well-studied forms of interpersonal communication. And, we'll rely heavily on experiential learning to bring the concepts to life. For example, to better understand the dynamics of unstructured, spontaneous communication, we will participate in an improvisational theatre workshop, taught by one of the artists-in-residence at the Groundlings Theater in Los Angeles. To better understand persuasive communication tactics, we'll participate in role-play exercises, competitive games, and negotiation simulations. For each tactic, we'll talk about why it works, when it works best, and what its limitations might be. We'll discuss how you can put these approaches to work in order to support your goals.After taking this course, you will be better able to: (1) identify strategies for crafting effective communication in the form of everyday conversation, written work, and public presentations, (2) develop techniques for building strong, long-term relationships with your peers, and (3) become more persuasive in advancing an agenda, acquiring resources, or gaining support from others.

        "course_description": "Human thinking is geared toward understanding and mastering social interactions. \nOB 115N explores cognitive, affective, behavioral, social and organizational processes that shape how we manage strategic interactions. The course builds on concepts and research findings from decision theory, behavioral game theory, negotiation research, and other relevant streams of investigation in the social sciences. By the end of this course, participants should have a better understanding of the structural and psychological factors that underlie competition and cooperation, bargaining, contracting, social influence, dispute resolution, and other types of social and organizational interactions. In addition to understanding how to analyze human thinking, feeling, and action in interactive contexts, participants will have opportunities to develop their behavioral skills through in-class exercises and simulations. Participants will play assigned roles in simulated interactions that will allow them to try out tactics that might feel uncomfortable trying in actual situations, get constructive feedback from other participants, and learn how they come across. The course readings, which are aimed to complement the in-class exercises, debriefs, and discussions, are aimed to further stimulate participants' interest in human cognition, emotion, and behavior in interactive contexts.To understand how decisions happen, we will use a combination of experiential exercises in class and in-depth discussions of theory and new and exciting research findings on cognitive and emotional aspects of decision making (e.g., what does \"bounded-rationality\" mean? how does power shape our negotiation behavior? how do our emotions influence our decisions?). We will play interactive games in our meetings to understand how various conditions, such as time pressure, power and uncertainty, influence our decisions. So, if you enjoy in-class exercises, you will enjoy our simulations. At the same time, if you enjoy analyzing human behavior and social interactions, you will like the readings and our discussions. After taking this course, you will be better able to identify and avoid common traps in strategic decision making and have a deeper understanding of other people's thinking and decision making processes.",

While we examine various inspiring examples of social brands, we will find that the rules are yet to be written.

More importantly, it is a proving ground for new technologies and a battlefield for the giants of the automotive industry. While race car performance depends on elements such as engine power, chassis design, tire adhesion and of course, the driver, aerodynamics probably plays the most vital role in determining the performance and efficiency of a race car. Front and/or rear wings are visible on many of them. During this seminar, you will learn about many other critical components of a race car including diffusers and add-ons such as vortex generators and spoilers. You will also discover that due to the competitive nature of this sport and its associated short design cycles, engineering decisions about a race car must rely on combined information from track, wind tunnel, and numerical computations. It is clear that airplanes fly on wings. However, when you have completed this seminar, you will be able to understand that cars fly on their tires. You will also be able to appreciate that aerodynamics is important not only for drag reduction, but also for increasing cornering speeds and lateral stability. You will be able to correlate between a race car shape and the aerodynamics effects intended for influencing performance.

Effective application of social science theory and methods may improve the design and evaluation of such community engagement programs. In this class, we partner with environmental and social justice organizations in the Bay Area to explore two questions: 1) How can recent findings from the social sciences be applied to design more effective community engagement programs ? 2) How can we rigorously evaluate outreach and education programs to ensure they are achieving the desired objectives? The course will include an overview of key theories from psychology, sociology, and education, field trips to partnering organizations, and a term-long community-engaged research project focused on designing and/or evaluating a local outreach or educational program that is meant to achieve social and environmental change.",

The U.S. energy system today is subject to a complex regime of state and federal laws. We will examine the historical role of state-level electric utility regulation, tracing its evolution into the various forms of regulated and deregulated energy markets now in use in the U.S. electricity and natural gas sectors. Contemporary energy law increasingly involves a delicate federalist balance where state and federal regulators share overlapping authority in contested policy areas that are subject to major technological and economic change, as changes in the supply and costs of renewable and fossil energy resources alike transform the U.S. energy sector. Finally, we will interrogate the contested ideals of regulation and competition, which private, non-profit, and governmental stakeholders all deploy in legal and political fora to advance private gain and public goods\u00bfmost recently in a series of transformative proposals to use federal emergency powers to provide financial bailouts to legacy fossil and nuclear power plants. Students who complete the class will gain a historical understanding of how economic regulation of the energy sector has evolved since the early 20th century, a durable conceptual framework for understanding modern energy law and policy debates, and a practical understanding of energy law designed for future practitioners. Non-law students interested in energy issues are highly encouraged to take this course, as energy law literacy is essential to careers in the sector.

Energy use is woven throughout the fabric of modern societies, and energy systems are also a primary way that humans interact with the global Earth systems like climate. We know enough about the potential impacts of climate change to see that we need to transform the world\u00bfs energy systems to a much cleaner set of technologies with much lower greenhouse gas emissions. Economies that use energy in a clean, cost-effective way will be much more competitive in the future. The clean energy transition is now underway, with reductions in coal use and rapid growth in solar and wind deployment, but there is much more to do to limit the adverse impacts of climate change. This seminar explores technology options available to make the changes needed, in the developed and developing worlds. There is no shortage of energy available for our use. Instead, the challenge is to convert those energy resources into services like electricity and transportation, and that conversion requires technology, as well as policies and markets that enable innovation. The scale of the world\u00bfs energy systems is dauntingly large, and we will need a well-diversified set of options to meet the challenge. Wind, solar, nuclear, carbon capture and storage for fossil fuel use, modified agriculture, electric (and automated) vehicles, advanced air conditioning, and many other technology options exist. We will consider these technologies and ask what barriers will have to be addressed if they are to be deployed at a scale large enough to reduce the impact climate change.

Today, we can create a global, irrefutable ledger of transactions, events, and diagnoses, such that rewriting history is computationally infeasible. What can we build on top of such a powerful data structure? What are the consequences of pseudo-legal contracts and promises written in mathematical ink? In this class, we will bring together experts in cryptography, healthcare, and distributed consensus with students across the university.

The class progresses through a series of problems designed to develop a sensitivity to paint application and surface quality; as well as to value, composition, volume, light, and space as the necessary elements of recreating perceptual experience. By the end of the course, students are able to apply some sophisticated techniques to visual problem solving. The aim of the course is to demonstrate the mechanical structure of oil painting.",

You will learn about a variety of tools which enable Perception (i.e. understanding what is happening in the organization right now), Prediction (i.e. forecasting what is likely to happen in the future, based on sophisticated extrapolation of past data) and Prototyping (i.e. determining which decisions are likely to be successful based on pilot tests) in organizations. This is a hands-on class: we will rely extensively on group exercises, in which you will be able to learn enough about analytical tools and programming to be able to collaborate with analysts and evaluate their work. You will also have the chance to interact with industry speakers who have been applying these techniques in practice. The suite of new ideas that characterize \u00bfOrg2.0\u00bf represents a major departure from the mainstream approach to organization design, which relies extensively on copying \u00bfbest practices\u00bf from other companies, represents organizations as \u00bfboxes and arrows\u00bf organization charts, and is typically obsessed with incentive compensation and reporting as the key organizational/HR decisions. In Org2.0, you will learn how to use analytics to find out what works specifically for your company (rather than what worked in others), develop detailed models of interactions among employees (rather than among boxes) to help them collaborate successfully, and think of organization design as a combination of factors which can all be better understood through analytics. This approach has been made possible both by recent theoretical developments in organization design and by access to vast computational power and data arising from digitalization. Some of the skills you will learn include: -Thinking about complex organizations by breaking them down into a few basic building blocks or \u00bfmicro-structures\u00bf -Using graph theory to map networks of interaction within organizations -Using machine learning to answer the fundamental \u00bfpeople\u00bf questions in organizations: whom to hire, develop and retain? - Prototyping organizational changes in silico using agent-based computational models -Using A/B testing (a.k.a. Randomized Controlled Trials) to know rather than guess which organizational designs will be effective Who should take this course? If you are likely to be involved in strategy execution, post-merger integration, re-organizations, or HR in either a direct or advisory role (regardless of how big or small your company is), this course will put you at the cutting edge of thinking and methodology in these areas. Some of the exercises will involve programming (in the Python language, specifically). However, you DO NOT need to know statistics (beyond that covered in core courses) or computer programming to take and benefit from this course. We will provide technical support and will design exercises in a way that you can focus your energies on mastering the concepts and thinking of solving business problems.

We will read works by successful thinkers, travelers, poets, lovers, and bureaucrats written between 800 and 1900 C.E. We will ask ourselves whether we agree with their choices and judgments about what is a life well lived.",

Since 1992 generations of Stanford students have heard, seen, and felt the power of taiko, big Japanese drums, at Admit Weekend, NSO, or Baccalaureate. During a time of COVID, this online version of the seminar takes students behind the taiko. Taiko is a relative newcomer to the American music scene. The contemporary ensemble drumming form, or kumidaiko, developed in Japan in the 1950s. The first North American taiko groups emerged from the Japanese American community shortly after and coincided with increased Asian American activism. In the intervening years, taiko has spread into communities in the UK, Europe, Australia, and South America. What drives the power of these drums? In this course, we explore the musical, cultural, historical, and political perspectives of taiko through readings and discussion, conversations with taiko artists, and online taiko lessons. With the taiko as our focal point, we find intersections of Japanese music, Japanese American history, and Asian American activism, and explore relations between performance, cultural expression, community, and identity.",

Students practice dimensional analysis, stoichiometry, and molecular naming that enables them to write chemical reactions, quantify reaction yield, and calculate empirical and molecular formulas. Using these skills, students estimate carbon efficiency of fossil fuels and identify unknowns in forensic analysis. Stoichiometry is reinforced through study of gases and their properties, through which students calculate the pressure exerted on a deep-sea diver. Students examine atomic and molecular structure by quantifying interactions among nuclei, electrons, atoms and molecules and explain trends in reactivity, such as why potassium metal catches fire in water. They explore how these interactions determine the structures and properties of pure substances, mixtures, proteins, and even DNA using three conceptual models for bonding: Lewis Dot, VSEPR, and Molecular Orbital Theory.

Labs and write-ups will allow students to more deeply explore and observe the different facets of chemical reactivity, including rates (kinetics), energetics (thermodynamics), and reversibility (equilibrium) of reactions. Through experimentation and discussion, students will determine what forces influence the rate of chemical reactions and learn how this can be applied to enzyme reactivity. Students will quantify chemical concentrations during a reaction, and predict the direction in which a reaction will shift in order to achieve equilibrium, including solubility equilibria. They will use these methods to estimate the possible levels of lead and other toxic metals in drinking water. Special emphasis will be placed on acid/base equilibria , allowing students to explore the role of buffers and antacids in our bodies, as well as ocean acidification and the impact on coral reefs. Students will then bring together concepts from both kinetics and equilibrium, in a deeper discussion of thermodynamics, to understand what ultimately influences the spontaneity of a reaction. Students will build a relationship between free energy, temperature, and equilibrium constants to be able to calculate the free energy of a reaction and understand how processes in our body are coupled to harness excess free energy to do useful work. Finally we will explore how we harness work from redox reactions, building both voltaic cells (i.e. batteries) and electrolytic cells in lab, and using reduction potentials to predict spontaneity and potential of a given reaction. We will look at the applications of redox chemistry in electric and fuel cell vehicles.

The course draws on probability, statistics, and decision theory. Probabilities provide a foundation for understanding uncertainties, such as the risks faced by investors, insurers, and capacity planners. We will discuss the mechanics of probability (manipulating some probabilities to get others) and how to use probabilities to make decisions about uncertain events. Statistics allows managers to use small amounts of information to answer big questions. For example, statistics can help predict whether a new product will succeed or what revenue will be next quarter. The third topic, decision analysis, uses probability and statistics to plan actions, such as whether to test a new drug, buy an option, or explore for oil. In addition to improving your quantitative reasoning skills, this class seeks to prepare you for later classes that draw on this material, including finance, economics, marketing, and operations. At the end we will discuss how this material relates to machine learning and artificial intelligence.",

These systems of thought appeared first in China, and eventually spread to Korea and Japan. Each culture developed its own ways of reconciling the competing systems, but in each case the comprehensive structure of values and human ideals differs significantly from those that appeared elsewhere in the ancient world. The course examines East Asian ideas about self-cultivation, harmonious society, rulership, and the relation between human and nature with a view toward expanding our understanding of these issues in human history, and highlighting their legacies in Asian civilizations today.

Without exception, all socio-cultural groups have evidenced complex interactions with the animals around them, both domesticated and wild. However, the individual circumstances of these interactions are hugely complicated, and involve much more than direct human-animal contact, going far beyond this to incorporate social, ecological and spiritual contexts.n This course delves into this complexity, covering the gamut of social roles played by animals, as well as the methods and approaches to studying these, both traditional and scientific. While the notion of `animals as social actors is well acknowledged, their use as proxies for human autecology (the relationship between a species and its environment) is also increasingly recognized as a viable mechanism for understanding our cultural and economic past. It will piece together the breadth of human-animal relationships using a wide geographic range of case studies.",

The archaeological imagination is a creative capacity mobilized when we experience traces and vestiges of the past, when we gather, classify, conserve and restore, when we work with such remains to deliver stories, reconstructions, accounts, explanations, or whatever. This class will explore such a wide archaeological perspective in novels, poetry, fantasy literature, the arts, movies, online gaming, and through some key debates in contemporary archaeology about human origins, the spread of urban life, the rise and fall of ancient empires.",

These artifacts and sites allow us to recreate human pasts in different ways, but only if we can make the most of every partial clue that archaeology uncovers. How do approaches like laser scanning and digital modeling help us maximize archaeological documentation and analysis? How will 3D visualization bring archaeological finds to the public in more innovative, immersive, and democratic ways than ever before? How can we put the past into the hands of a global community anywhere and at any time through interactive digital reconstructions and physical replicas? Can 4D approaches integrating time help us understand ancient social processes through digital approaches? What ethical questions of practice, ownership, and display arise as archaeology confronts each of these new opportunities? How do such developments force us to reexamine the complex ways in which technologies are changing our relationship with the human past? This seminar bridges the theoretical and the practical, allowing students to develop hands-on projects\u00bfusing 3D analysis of objects on campus\u00bfthat ask fundamental questions about how artifacts worked in the past, how they speak in the present, and how new digital tools can transform their voices in the future. Trips to collections on campus and in the area, as well as visits from diverse experts in the field and case studies from the instructor\u00bfs own excavation (a Roman shipwreck of marble architectural materials) allow engagement with emerging technological approaches to the archaeological record.",

Questions we will ask ourselves during the quarter include, what is \"Asian\" about Asian cuisine? How has the language of food changed? Is eating, and talking about eating, a gendered experience?

How do we understand the aesthetic, storytelling, and politics of Asian screen cultures vis-\u00e0-vis its historical and social context? While exploring these transnational and transdisciplinary questions, this course will deal with topical issues of Pan-Asian identity, (trans)nationalism, (un)translatability, commodity fetishism, locality and globality, technophobia, and politics of gender. Students will learn how to think and write about screen cultures of East Asia in particular and of our world of screens in general.",

Specifically, we will explore the traditional elements of Korean court food, and the transformation of this cuisine as a consequence of the Korean War and South Korea\u00bfs subsequent globalizing economy; the intersection of traditional Japanese food with past and contemporary identities; and the evolution of Chinese cuisine that accompanies shifting attitudes about the environment, health, and well-being. Questions we will ask ourselves during the quarter include, what is \"Asian\" about Asian cuisine? How has the language of food changed? Is eating, and talking about eating, a gendered experience? How have changing views of the self and community shifted the conversation around the ethics and ecology of meat consumption?",

Are divisions by gender categories justified and what should we think of gender testing? Is the use of animals in sport ever justified? Which forms of performance enhancements are acceptable in sport (the ethics of drug use and enhancements through technologies)? Should we ban sports that damage the players\u00bf health? Does society owe social support to people who hurt themselves while practicing extreme sports? nnThe class will be structured around small group discussions and exercises as well as brief lectures to introduce key moral and political concepts (such as fairness, equality, freedom, justice, exploitation, etc.).

        "course_description": "What is a medium? This course starts from the assumption that the answer to this question is not as obvious as it might at first appear. Clearly, we know some media when we see them: radio, film, and television are in many ways paradigmatic media of the twentieth century. But what about the computational, networked media of the twenty-first century? Are these still media in the same sense, or has the nature of media changed with the emergence of digital technologies? And what, for that matter, about pre-technical media? Is painting a medium in the same sense that oil or acrylic are media, or in the sense that we speak of mixed media? Is language a medium? Are numbers? Is the body? As we shall see, the question of what a medium is raises a number of other questions of a theoretical or even philosophical nature. How is our experience of the world affected or shaped by media? Are knowledge and perception possible apart from media, or are they always mediated by the apparatuses, instruments, or assemblages of media? What is the relation between the forms and the contents of media, and how does this relation bear on questions of aesthetics, science, technology, or politics? The lecture-based course addresses these and other questions and seeks in this way to introduce a way of thinking about media that goes beyond taken-for-granted ideas and assumptions, and that has a potentially transformative effect on a wide range of theoretical and practical interests.nnnFilm & Media Studies majors and minors must enroll for 5 units.",

        "course_description": "In this course, we will explore what it means to write with video, and we will learn to make effective and engaging video essays about historical and contemporary audiovisual media. Specifically, we will examine formal, aesthetic, and rhetorical strategies for communicating in the medium of video, and we will conduct a series of hands-on exercises utilizing digital video editing software to construct arguments, analyses, and interpretations of film and other media (including television, video games, and online media). Compared with traditional, text-based engagements, the video essay offers a remarkably direct mode of communicating critical and analytical ideas. In this medium, authors no longer struggle to describe audiovisual contents in words that can never do justice to the rich array of details that are immediately apparent to spectators eyes and ears; instead, video essayists can simply show their viewers what they want them to see. This does not mean, however, that it is any easier to write effectively with video than it is to compose an essay with pen and paper. Similar types of expository and argumentative planning are involved in both forms, while the new technology introduces its own characteristic challenges and choices, including decisions about the spatial and temporal organization and transformation of audiovisual materials, the addition of onscreen text, voiceover commentary, and visual effects. By taking a hands-on approach, we will develop our skills with editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro and Apple's Final Cut Pro while also cultivating our awareness of the formal and narrative techniques employed in films and other moving-image media. Through weekly assignments and group critique sessions, we will learn to express ourselves more effectively and creatively in audiovisual media. As a culmination of our efforts, we will assemble a group exhibition of our best video essays for public display on campus.nnNo previous experience is required, but a willingness to learn new technologies (in particular, video editing software) is important.",

Now comes the time to decide how to bring about justice for the past wrongs. It is also a question of how to come to terms with the terrible past. How to remember it? How to confront it? How to judge the perpetrators? How to identify them? How to punish them appropriately if at all? Also, is it possible to ever reconcile with the former oppressors and enemies?

What if some of the victims were also perpetrators?nnThe scenarios mentioned above are real ones\u00bfthey happened in Germany, Rwanda, South Africa, Bosnia, and elsewhere.

And we will do so by examining some of the most iconic works of art, from Dante's writings on lovesickness to Caravaggio's Narcissus, studying the ways that objects have shifted from keepsakes to targets of our cares. While exploring the visual roots and evolutions of what has become one of life's fundamental drives, this course offers a passionate survey of European art from Giotto's kiss to Fragonard's swing that elicits stimulating questions about the sensorial nature of desire and the human struggle to control emotions.",

Hundreds of ancient Jewish and Christian texts are not included in the Bible. \"What Didn't Make It in the Bible\" focuses on these excluded writings. We will explore the Dead Sea Scrolls, Gnostic gospels, hear of a five-year-old Jesus throwing temper tantrums while killing (and later resurrecting) his classmates, peruse ancient romance novels, explore the adventures of fallen angels who sired giants (and taught humans about cosmetics), tour heaven and hell, encounter the garden of Eden story told from the perspective of the snake, and learn how the world will end. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Judaism, Christianity, the bible, or ancient history. It is designed for students who are part of faith traditions that consider the bible to be sacred, as well as those who are not. The only prerequisite is an interest in exploring books, groups, and ideas that eventually lost the battles of history and to keep asking the question \"why.\" In critically examining these ancient narratives and the communities that wrote them, you will investigate how religions canonize a scriptural tradition, better appreciate the diversity of early Judaism and Christianity, understand the historical context of these religions, and explore the politics behind what did and did not make it into the bible.",

This course surveys their most vivid writings, from ancient Greece to the colonization of the New World, focusing on the relation between fascination with the other and the author's own religious imagination. In particular, it introduces the contributions of Jewish travelers and ethnographers to this history, which has often been written from the standpoint of imperial, ecclesiastical or colonial power. It stresses literary continuities across three general periods (ancient, medieval, and colonial), showing how remarkably consistent patterns of identification spring from diverse encounters.",

Close attention will be paid to the historical context of these sources, and we will also engage with broader methodological approaches--from phenomenology to philology--regarding the academic study of religion and the comparative consideration of mysticism in particular. \nThis course assumes no prior background of Judaism or any other religious traditions.

Preserving the distinctiveness of each religious tradition, this seminar examines: the issue of religion as the cause of the environmental crisis; the resources for ecological responses within each tradition; the emergence of new religious ecologies and ecological theologies; the contribution of world religions to environmental ethics; and the degree to which the environmental crisis has functioned--and will function--as the basis of inter-faith collaboration.

Some fundamental questions the course considers: How do we get beyond the idea that the study and making of art are elite, \u00bfprivileged\u00bf activities apart from the real world? How do we develop a sense of discernment\u00bfof deciding for ourselves which artists matter, and which don\u00bft\u00bfwithout being a snob? How can works of art teach us to feel the wonder of being alive and our deep debt to the past, to the dead? Focusing on painters such as Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Goya, Manet, Morisot, and Charlotte Salomon, this course will pursue these questions with the aim of challenging and encouraging students to develop their own ways of thinking and feeling\u00bfgenerously and ethically\u00bfabout the past and the present.

Yet potters, painters and even sculptors possessed little social standing. Why did the Greeks value the work of craftsmen but not the men themselves? Why did Herodotus dismiss those who worked with their hands as \"mechanics?\" What prompted Homer to claim that \"there is no greater glory for a man than what he achieves with his own hands,\" provided that he was throwing a discus and not a vase on a wheel? Painted pottery was essential to the religious and secular lives of the Greeks. Libations to the gods and to the dead required vessels from which to pour them. Economic prosperity depended on the export of wine and oil in durable clay containers. At home, depictions of gods and heroes on vases reinforced Greek values and helped parents to educate their children. Vases depicting Dionysian excess were produced for elite symposia, from which those who potted and painted them were excluded. Sculptors were less lowly but still regarded as \"mechanics,\" with soft bodies and soft minds (Xenophon), \"indifferent to higher things\" (Plutarch). The seminar addresses such issues as we work to acknowledge our own privilege and biases.

In the beginning, as Greece emerges from 200 years of Dark Ages, their art is cautious, conservative and more abstract than life-like, closer to Calder than Michelangelo. While Homer describes the rippling muscles (and egos) of Bronze Age heroes, his fellow painters and sculptors prefer abstraction. This changes in the 7th century, when travel to and trade with the Near East transform Greek culture. What had been an insular society becomes cosmopolitan, enriched by the sophisticated artistic traditions of lands beyond the Aegean \"frog pond.\" Imported Near Eastern bronzes and ivories awaken Greek artists to a wider range of subjects, techniques and ambitions. Later in the century, Greeks in Egypt learn to quarry and carve hard stone from Egyptian masters. Throughout the 6th century, Greek artists absorb what they had borrowed, compete with one another, defy their teachers, test the tolerance of the gods and eventually produce works of art that speak with a Greek accent. By the end of the archaic period, images of gods and mortals bear little trace of alien influence or imprint, yet without the contributions of Egypt and the Near East, Greek art as we know it would have been unthinkable.",

But is anything possible in a human language, and is there anything that is common to all languages? Looking past the vast surface differences, linguists have discovered deep commonalities among the languages of the world as well as strict limits on the observed variation and on what a possible human language is. In this seminar, we will seek to uncover the building blocks of language and the laws that govern their interactions. Our goal will be to reach an understanding of the ways in which languages are systematically alike and different, as well as of the nature of language in general. We will investigate a variety of topics, including crosslinguistic differences and similarities with respect to word order, the grammatical structure of questions, and how languages mark subjects and objects. We will explore the structure of both sentences and words, identifying and studying their fundamental properties. In this pursuit, we will rely on data from a range of languages, such as English, Navajo, Zulu, and many others. This seminar will teach you how to view language as an object of scientific study, introducing you to central concepts and methods of linguistics (with a particular emphasis on syntax) along the way. It will give you the tools to describe and analyze even unfamiliar languages, and will teach you to construct explicit hypotheses about how language works and to test them empirically.

        "course_description": "As individuals, we would like to believe that we are free from biases and that we are somehow immune to acting on the social biases that we have been socialized to since birth. We would like to believe that we can report experiences accurately, recalling events as they truly happened. But, memory is faulty and stereotypes and social biases are pervasive. And, at a level beneath our own control, these biases slip in and influence our memory of events. Eyewitness memory, and the inaccuracy and unreliability of eyewitnesses, is a perfect example of this. But, what about the things we hear? Speech carries a great deal of information; packets of co-varying cues we have been raised to recognize categorically, informing us about a talker\u00bfs race, accent, emotion, and gender. We have, through our ears, information about events that occur. And, we have in our minds, stereotyped expectations about how various groups of people behave and what various groups of people might say. In this course, we will explore how these two types of information (e.g., the percept of what is actually heard vs. our stereotypes about who is likely to have said what) clash together and influence \u00bfearwitness memory\u00bf. We will read and critique journal articles, blogs, and popular science articles, think about the reliability of memory for auditory events, and we will work together to develop three well-designed thought experiments that address questions at the heart of this issue. Along the way, we will learn a bit about the acoustics of speech, social variation in speech, speech perception and spoken word recognition, memory, and experimental design and analysis. Students in this course should be committed to reading the assignments, sharing their ideas about the readings (without concern for \u00bfbeing right\u00bf), and think creatively about ways we can explore the idea of earwitness memory together. While this is a one-quarter course, my goal is to pursue our thought experiments collaboratively, with any interested students in subsequent quarters.",

And even though accents are usually labeled in geographical terms, their symbolic meanings extend far beyond mere coordinates on a map. When we hear a New Yorker, we not only wonder whether they\u00bfre from Brooklyn, but also conjecture about the kind of person they are: they might prefer to walk down the street quickly over strolling, they might enjoy lively conversations where people talk over one another, and they might tend to express their opinions bluntly. This seminar explores the linguistic practices and social meaning of accents spoken in San Francisco. nClass participants will collectively choose a neighborhood in San Francisco for in-depth examination. Through a series of field trips (once every two or three weeks), students will document the varieties of English spoken by lifelong residents of the neighborhood. Field assignments will consist primarily of observation and audio-recorded interviews. Interviews will serve as data for linguistic analysis (transcription, quantitative analysis of a linguistic feature of interest) throughout the term. Linguistic patterns will be analyzed in relation to salient social issues in the community, which will be identified in both interview content and historical records.nUpon completing the seminar, students will have (a) learned how to treat language as an object of scientific analysis, (b) developed an understanding of the social ramifications of linguistic practice, (c) gained fieldwork skills in general and interviewing skills in particular, and (d) come to appreciate the diversity of experiences in an urban community near Stanford.",

From this foundation, the course will move on to explore how the subtle variation and change of sounds is used to construct identity, foster relationships, and shape community. We will also investigate how exciting linguistic research sheds light on important contemporary social debates and on speech technology. Throughout the course, students will supplement readings, exercises, and discussion with lab sessions that will teach them how to manipulate and analyze speech sound recordings.

Language evolution left no fossils behind, so how can different proposed explanations for it be evaluated? We will examine the argumentation behind different proposed explanations and the various methodologies that have been used to support them.

What does their behavior tell us about their inner lives, and about ourselves? What do lipstick and cuckoos and fireflies have in common? Why would nobody want to be a penguin? What do mice say to each other in their pee-mail? Learning how to think about questions like these gives us a unique perspective on the natural world. Format: Discussion and criticism of video examples, documentaries, and research papers. Topics: History and approaches to animal behavior; development of behavior, from genetics to learning; mechanisms of behavior, from neurons to motivation; function of behavior, from honest signals to selfish genes; the phylogeny of behavior, from domestication to speciation; and modern applications of behavior, from abnormal behavior, to conservation, to animal welfare, and animal consciousness.",

In this seminar, students will gain an appreciation for basic mammalian anatomic and physiologic principles that span across multiple species while emphasizing key differences that render each species unique. Through student projects, we will explore evolutionary adaptations that have driven the success of a variety of species within the context of their natural environments. In addition to lecture content, virtual laboratory sessions will reinforce anatomic principles through a combination of rodent cadaver dissection and examination of organ and bone specimens. Students with a passion for science will gain a fundamental understanding of anatomy that is applicable to future careers in medicine, biomedical research, veterinary medicine, and ecology/conservation.",

The course treats race as multifaceted construct, with multiple (and often times conflicting) influences on political behavior. The course stresses the constructed nature of both race and politics. The course will be split into 3 parts. In the first part we will explore the relationship between racial identity and political behavior at the individual level.

In this seminar, we will study markets as social institutions permeated with moral meaning. We will explore how powerful actors work to institutionalize certain understandings of good and bad; unpack how particular moral visions materially benefit some groups of people more so than others; examine the ways people draw on notions of fairness to justify and contest the market's distribution of resources and opportunities; and consider who has agency to build markets according to different normative ideals.

After all we know what would happened if some business set up separate bathrooms for blacks and whites.

Why is discrimination against short people, overweight people, or people with annoying personalities not against the law?

Together, we will learn to be critical of, as well as to think, and act, like human rights advocates.

We will consider and understand the differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the frequently non-western) developing world, as well as tensions between and among rights advocates along other important dimensions (civil and political vs. economic, social and cultural rights; rights promotion through engagement of powerful actors vs. challenging structures of power, etc.).

Dostoevsky penned his vow to love life on the day that he was manacled as a political prisoner and marched off to thirteen years of forced labor and exile in Siberia. He exploded back on the Petersburg literary scene in the early 1860's with three block-busters, \nNotes from the Underground, \nMemoirs from the House of the Dead, and \nCrime and Punishment, establishing himself forever as Russia's most controversial explorer of the violence of human thought. In these same years Emily Dickinson was sequestering herself in her family's Amherst house for the remainder of her life, yet she announced her rebel's credo in these enigmatic lines: \n\"My Life Had Stood, a Loaded Gun - until the Day...\" In this class we will explore the idea that Emily Dickinson and Fyodor Dostoevsky may be seen as original shifters of modern literary art and philosophy. We will unpack the agonizing relationship of freedom, action, and language that both authors explore. Classes will be organized around presentations, debates in pairs, the exploration of \"scandalous scenes,\" and finally a symposium in which students will present and contribute to each other's paper projects.

They address critical psychological questions people have, like \u00bfDo people like me belong in this school?\u00bf, \u00bfCan I learn math?\u00bf, \u00bfAm I bad mom?\u00bf, and \u00bfCan groups in conflict change?\u00bf.

In addition to learning from classic and contemporary research, you will design your very own wise intervention and workshop others\u00bf efforts. Working with a community partner, you will explore a problem your partner faces, identify a specific psychological process you think contributes to this problem, and design an intervention to address this process to improve outcomes, which your partner could implement and evaluate. You will share your approach in a final report with both your seminar-mates and your community partner.

It supports cooperation, fosters relationships, improves health, and overwrites hatred. Kindness is also challenging, especially in the modern world. More than ever, individuals are isolated, anonymous, and independent: qualities that make it harder to truly see each other and easier to succumb to indifference and even cruelty. As technology mediates more of our interactions and tribal signifiers occupy more of our identity, kindness erodes. And yet we have options. A growing number of social scientists are now experimenting in re-building kindness, using everything from virtual reality to meditation to literature to old-fashioned friendship. Their efforts demonstrate that through directed effort, people can become kinder. nThis class will explore the nature of kindness, the challenges modernity has placed in front of it, and the many ways scientists and practitioners are stimulating kindness. Though drawing mainly from psychology, we will tour sociology, conflict resolution, technology, the humanities, and neuroscience as well. The class will also grapple with central questions about human nature -most importantly, to what extent can we change ourselves into the people we\u00bfd like to become? Finally, we will meld science with personal narrative and exercises meant to not only explore kindness-building as a research concept, but as a part of our own lives.",

Students will explore research on how mindsets about nutrition, exercise, and stress can alter the body's response to those phenomena. Students will also uncover how social interactions with friends, family, colleagues and the media influence the perceived quality and impact of cultural products such as art, music, and fashion. And students will learn about the neurological and physiological underpinnings of the placebo effect, a powerful demonstration of expectation that produces real, healing changes in the body. Finally, students will have the opportunity to consider real world applications in disciplines including policy, business, medicine, academics, athletics and public health and consider the ethical implications of those applications. Throughout the class active participation and an open mind will be critical to success.

Students will be exposed to the challenges faced by patients from diverse backgrounds and their caregivers. Each student will be assigned a small panel of patients. Due to COVID, all patient and family interaction will be virtual. Students will work with an inter-disciplinary team, conduct virtual calls on patients in their panel, and write progress notes, which will become a part of the patients' electronic medical records.

Jewish culture is a diasporic one, and for this reason the concept of Jewishness differs from country to country and across time. What stays remarkably similar, though, is Jewish self-perception and relatedly Jewish literary style. This is as true for the first-generation immigrant writers like Isaac Bashevis Singer and Anzia Yezierska who came to the United States from abroad as it is for their second-generation children born in the United States, and the children of those children. In this course, we will consider the difficulties of displacement for the emigrant generation and their efforts to sustain their cultural integrity in the multicultural American environment. We'll also examine the often comic revolt of their American-born children and grandchildren against their (grand-)parents nostalgia and failure to assimilate. Only by considering these transnational roots can one understand the particularity of the Jewish-American novel in relation to mainstream and minority American literatures. In investigating the link between American Jewish writers and their literary progenitors, we will draw largely but not exclusively from Russia and the countries of Eastern Europe.",

Core clinical skills are acquired through hands-on practice, and evaluated through an extensive program of simulated medical encounters, in which students interview, examine, and manage patients in a mock clinic. The information literacy thread introduces students to informatics and knowledge management, biomedical informatics, and evidence-based medicine searching. Nutrition principles are acquired through interactive, web-based instruction, and reinforced through problem-based learning cases, which run in parallel to the basic science components over the first year. In epdemiology students learn the taxonomy of epidemiological studies, how to critically read a journal article, and how to recognize and understand the concepts behind different clinical study designs. Topics include bias, confounding, diagnostic testing and screening, and \"how statistics can lie.\" Psychiatry introduces students to the unique role of medical students in talking with patients, the difference between process and content in patient communication, how to respond to breaks in the patient-physician relationship, and the relationship between the quality of the patient-physician interaction and health outcomes. Health care policy covers such topics as health insurance, physician payment, health care costs, access, measurement and improvement of quality, regulation and health care reform. Biomedical ethics includes important ethical issues in medical practice, such as confidentiality, privacy, and ethical issues relating to medical students. The population health curriculum exposes students to concepts of public health, community action, and advocacy, and includes a year-long, community-based project.

We show why free competitive markets can improve people's lives and how they have removed millions from people from poverty, with many more, we hope, to come; we show how monopolies and environmental spillovers cause market failures; we show how to remedy these failures through government policy; and we explain why government failure can also be a problem. The overall goal is to use economics to understand the big issues of the day including economic growth, inequality, crises, and unemployment. The goal of this course is to learn how to use economic analysis to reach reasoned conclusions about the big issues of the day from the workings and benefits of a market economy to the causes of economic growth, financial crises, and unemployment.",

This class will review the literature on historical and contemporary migrant flows. We will tackle three major questions in the economics of immigration: whether immigrants were positively or negatively selected from their sending countries; how immigrants assimilated into the US economy and society; and what effects that immigration may have on the economy, including the effect of immigration on native employment and wages. In each case, we will present studies covering the two main eras of US immigration history, the Age of Mass Migration from Europe (1850-1920) and the recent period of renewed mass migration from Asia and Latin America. Students will participate in a final project, which could include developing their own recommendations for how to design immigration policy in the US.

This course will examine humanity's varied relationships with the environment, with a focus on the role of science and technology. Topics include: industrialization and modernism, diversity in environmentalism, environmental justice and inequalities, climate politics, global-local tensions, nuclear technology, the Anthropocene debate, and COVID-19 and the environment. Students will explore theoretical and methodological approaches in STS and related fields in social sciences, and conduct original research that engages with environmental issues of their choice. Enrollment limited to juniors and seniors, or with consent of instructor.",

Lectures will emphasize the theoretical basis underlying infectious disease dynamics and link them to in-class workshops and problem sets that will emphasize public health applications and will provide students with hands-on experience in creating and coding models. Students will learn the mathematical underpinnings of key topics in infectious disease transmission including herd immunity, the basic reproductive number, vaccine effects, social contact structure, host heterogeneities, and pathogen fitness. The course will teach students how to approach new questions in infectious disease transmission, from model selection, tradeoffs in model complexity or parsimony, parameterization, sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Students will practice building models, evaluating the influence of model parameters, making predictions about disease trajectories, and projecting the impact of public health interventions.

Problems that may arise by labeling conditions that vary in incidence, prevalence and/or severity across the \"male-female\" spectrum as \"men's\" or \"women's\" health issues will be discussed. In addition, the importance of recognizing the spectrum of sex and gender, as well as sexual orientation, in clinical practice from pediatric to geriatric populations, will be highlighted, with consideration of varying perspectives within different race/ethnic, religious, political, and other groups.",

Students will examine how artists use craft elements such as setting, characters, and plot, cover art, and musical form and instrumentation, then apply that learning in their own productions. Creating music, beats, soundscapes, and artwork will be encouraged, but the final project need only be a cycle of recorded, spoken song lyrics. We\u00bfll focus in particular on narratives of race, class, gender, and sexuality and their social implications as we examine works from artists across musical genres\u00bffrom classic and punk rock artists such as Pink Floyd, David Bowie, and Green Day; to hip-hop, pop, and EDM performers such as Beyonc\u00e9, Lupe Fiasco, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Daft Punk, and Kendrick Lamar.

From smallpox to measles to HIV to the common cold, viruses have literally changed the course of human history and impacted evolution. They have also been important experimental tools for probing the molecular nature of key biological processes, and they have been utilized in many key discoveries and Nobel Prize-winning research programs. In books, movies, newspapers, and electronic feeds, viruses continue to make the news on a daily basis. Using contemporary media, content experts, model building, interactive sessions, and field trips, we will explore the essential nature of viruses, what makes them unique, how they are classified, how they cause disease, key molecular processes, breakthroughs in prevention and treatment, current efforts in trying to eradicate viruses, and cultural iconography pertaining to viruses.

Integration is discussed for rational functions (a loose end from \nMath 20) and especially (improper) integrals for unbounded functions and \"to infinity\": this shows up in contexts as diverse as escape velocity for a rocket, the present value of a perpetual yield asset, and important calculations in probability (including the famous \"bell curve\" and to understand why many statistical tests work as they do). The course then turns to infinite series (how to \"sum\" an infinite collection of numbers), some useful convergence and divergence rests for these, and the associated killer app: power series and their properties, as well as Taylor approximations, all of which provide the framework that underlies virtually all mathematical models used in any quantitative field.",

The multivariable calculus portion includes unconstrained optimization via gradients and Hessians (used for energy minimization), constrained optimization (via Lagrange multipliers, crucial in economics), gradient descent and the multivariable Chain Rule (which underlie many machine learning algorithms, such as backpropagation), and Newton's method (an ingredient in GPS and robotics). The course emphasizes computations alongside an intuitive understanding of key ideas.

        "course_description": "VISITING: Open to visitors. TYPE OF CLERKSHIP: Selective 1. DESCRIPTION: This clinical clerkship provides brief broad exposure to general and subspecialty ophthalmology at Stanford University. The clerkship consists of spending time in clinic, the OR, and teaching sessions. Designed to accommodate students of differing levels of interest from those wanting a long-term career in ophthalmology to those who are just starting out and want to know how to spell ophthalmology. Rotation provides exposure at three clinical sites: Byers Eye Institute (Stanford), the Palo Alto VA, and Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. Students will visit each of the locations over the course of the rotation, spending your first and fourth weeks at one site, and the 2nd and 3rd weeks at each of the other two locations. Credentialing: Because of the exposure at three different clinical sites, students need to obtain site access prior to the start of the rotation. We have a streamlined process, but for visiting students, you will need to fill out the paperwork 6-8 weeks before the rotation begins. Please note: Visiting students are welcome (Due to COVID-19, enrollment will resume in period 3 or later). This clerkship is designed to provide broad exposure to ophthalmology training at Stanford. It will offer a glimpse into a training program that differs from your home institution and will hopefully aid in your residency selection process. FULL DISCLOSURE: For visiting students, participation in this clinical clerkship has a minimal, if any, impact on the likelihood of matching as a Stanford Ophthalmology resident. Because the rotation provides broad ophthalmic exposure, it results in spending shorter sessions with many different attendings. While we are not trying to dissuade students from visiting the Stanford program, we do want to be transparent that the rotation is not designed nor does it serve as a stepping stone into the residency program for visiting students. Broadly, this rotation is best suited for students who come from medical schools without large academic ophthalmology programs. For such students, this rotation provides an idea of what such a program feels like first hand and can aid in their future residency selection process. For students who are interested in more in depth interactions in a subspecialty of ophthalmology, the Ophto 398A may be more amenable by providing a 1-on-1 preceptorship opportunity for four weeks. Visiting students must obtain preapproval to apply from Dr. Ira Schachar prior to applying for this clerkship. Please email requests to Jingjing Chang at jchang24@stanford.edu. PREREQUISITES: Because of the rotation between sites, students must have access to some form transportation (it is a long bike ride between Byers and the VA, but you need a car to get to SCVMC). At all sites, parking is free. PERIODS AVAILABLE: 1-12. Full-time for 4 weeks, 3 students per period. CLERKSHIP DIRECTOR: Ira Schachar, M.D., ischacha@stanford.edu. CLERKSHIP COORDINATOR: Jingjing Chang, jchang24@stanford.edu. Please email Ira Schachar with questions at: ischacha@stanford.edu. REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS: Where: You will receive information regarding location and time the week prior to the start of the rotation; Time: TBA. CALL CODE: 2. OTHER FACULTY: The rotation is designed to provide broad exposure to the ophthalmic subspecialties at each of the three clinical sites. LOCATION: SUMC, PAVAMC, SCVMC.",

DESCRIPTION: Does the thought of evaluating diplopia, eye pain, or vision loss in a patient give you palpitations? This is the rotation for you. Offers a hands on, comprehensive experience focused on sharpening clinical eye examination skills and rationally evaluating ophthalmic conditions and problems. Students will examine patients with a variety of common and uncommon eye conditions, teach patients about their eye diseases, and learn to recognize situations that warrant referral to an ophthalmologist. Learning is enhanced through digital imaging techniques based on anterior and posterior segment ocular visualization, as well as newer modalities such as optical coherence tomography. Location is in lovely wine country in Livermore, with a cottage available for lodging, so your commute is to walk across the driveway, avoiding the wild turkeys. In addition to educational materials supplied during the rotation, students can also access Vaughan & Asbury's General Ophthalmology 16th Edition, by Paul Riordan-Eva and John P. Whitcher, online at \nhttp://lane.stanford.edu, then click on \"Students\" and then \"USMLEasy.com\" and then \"Ophthalmology.\" Directions from Stanford: Take 84 across the Dumbarton bridge and continue straight on Decoto Rd. Turn right on Alvarado-Niles, left on Nursery Ave, right on Mission Blvd. Make a left on Niles Canyon Rd (highway 84) and follow the signs to Livermore. Stay on 84 and make a right at Wetmore (the road past E. Vineyard), then a right at Arroyo. Continue up Arroyo into the hills; you'll see the white hospital in the distance on your right, 4951 Arroyo Rd. Total drive time is approximately one hour. Weekly schedule, Bldg 62: Monday: 8:30 am-4:30 pm, work with community ophthalmologists or VA staff. Tuesday: 8:30 am - 4:30 pm, work with VA ophthalmologists, usually at VA Palo Alto.

To understand the biology of brain function, this course will use highly interactive lectures and discussions to examine the validity of common beliefs about the brain, discuss how the brain and the nervous system are organized, how individual elements of the brain function, and how together these units produce action. The brain, like all other biological structures, has evolved over time in response to natural selection by adapting to diverse behavioral and environmental constraints. We use evolutionary comparisons to illuminate important questions about brain function, including what the origins and consequences of brain damage are, how and where drugs act, and how you collect, interpret, and understand information about the world.

In 1865, the peace treaty was signed at Appomattox and the Thirteenth Amendment outlawed slavery, but the battle over memory and national identity had just begun. The questions that the Civil War addressed - and failed to address - continue to affect our lives today. We will focus on how Americans negotiated issues of cultural memory and national identity through a close analysis of historical texts, novels, poems, films, paintings, cartoons, photographs, and music. Our interpretations will foreground the particular themes of race and nationhood, freedom and citizenship, and changing notions of individual and collective identity. Our assumption in this course is that history is not available to us as a set of events - fixed, past, and unchanging. Rather, history is known through each generation's interpretations of those events, and these interpretations are shaped by each generation's lived experience. What stories get told? Whose stories?

With an eye to thinking about representations of love in our own culture, we consider some of the foundational love books of the Western tradition. From Plato's Symposium to Chester Brown's graphic novel Paying For It, we ask the fundamental question of whether and how we might distinguish between spiritual and physical desire. We consider how medieval and contemporary writers dealt with the relation of love to sex, power, money, marriage, and gender. We discuss these works of the past, for example the illicit love in the courtly romance Tristan, in tandem with representations of clandestine love from the present day, such as the portrayal of same-sex love in Brokeback Mountain.",

Some scholars argue that belief results from direct experience, such as visions or moments of transcendence, that testify to God's existence. Others suggest that belief in the supernatural is better explained by the way the human mind has evolved or people's experience of the social world. In this class, we will pair medieval literature on Christian mysticism and magic with readings from modern psychology and anthropology. We will look at the dominant answers provided by each discipline. For example, belief might result from our sensory experience of the world, or it might have developed as part of our cognitive apparatus in response to fear. Our aim is to show how different disciplines can work together to cast light on a basic question of human existence.",

In this course, students will explore questions about the Universe, its beginnings, its structure, its extent, its fate, from several perspectives - philosophical, experimental, and theoretical.

The expected learning outcomes are: a greater understanding of the free speech's role in American society and democracy, how America's position on free speech compares to other countries, and how speech restriction and liberties can reveal larger patterns in social structure and agency. Finally, key skills students will develop are learning how to identify common ethical frameworks that academic and popular authors use and how to analyze the origins of and changes in social institutions and social structures.",

While the notion of `animals as social actors is well acknowledged, their use as proxies for human autecology (the relationship between a species and its environment) is also increasingly recognized as a viable mechanism for understanding our cultural and economic past.

Effective treatments are desperately needed, however, we still know very little about how neurons die in those diseases. One organelle that is especially important to neuronal health is mitochondria, the power plants for the cell. In this IntroSem, we will learn how neurons employ molecular machinery to regulate, transport, and distribute mitochondria, and importantly, how these fundamental regulations are compromised in neurological disorders. A hands-on laboratory section is available for students who are interested in learning imaging mitochondrial transport in live cells using confocal microscopy. The laboratory section is located at the beautiful Arastradero campus, which provides a unique opportunities for first-year students to explore Stanford campuses and adjacent areas.Prerequisites: High school biology.",

How can black, indigenous, and people of color frameworks help us reckon with oppressive systems that threaten safety and survival for marginalized people and the lands that sustain us? How can these questions reveal the brilliant and inventive forms of survival that precede and transcend harmful systems toward a world of possibility? Each week, this course will call on artists, scholars, and organizers of color who clarify the urgency and interconnection of issues from patriarchal violence to environmental degradation; criminalization to legacies of settler colonialism. These same thinkers will also speak to the imaginative, everyday knowledge and creative healing practices that our forebears have used for millennia to give vision and rise to true transformation.",

But in the aftermath of the Jim Crow era and the Civil Rights movement, can critics still speak, coherently, of \"African American literature\"? And how does this political conception of African American literary production compare with accounts grounded in black language and culture? Taking up Warren's intervention, this course will explore African American literature from its earliest manifestations in the spirituals and slave narratives to texts composed at the height of desegregation and decolonization struggles at mid-century and beyond.

Topics we will explore include the political and social formation of \"race\"; racial representation in the media, arts, and popular culture; the rise and decline of the \"one-drop rule\" and its effect on political and cultural attachments; the politicization of Census categories and the rise of the Multiracial Movement.",

Through reading and discussion of medical and scientific literature, we will tackle questions that include: how was life expectancy with CF increased from weeks to decades without understanding the disease mechanism? Why is the disease so prevalent? Is there an advantage to being a carrier? Is CF a single disease or a continuum of physiological variation; or- what is a disease? How did research into CF lead to discovery of the underlying cause of most other genetic diseases as well? Through critical reading of the scientific and medical literature, class discussion, field trips and meetings with genetic counselors, caregivers, patients, physicians and researchers, we will work to build a deep understanding of this disease, from the biochemical basis to the current controversies over pathogenic mechanisms, treatment strategies and the ethics and economics of genetic testing and astronomical drug costs.",

        "course_description": "The ancient Greeks longed for happiness, but life often led to suffering and anxiety. In ancient Greece, the traditional value system focused on gaining honor, wealth, power, and success - external goods that could be taken away at any time. The Greek philosophers Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle set forth ethical theories designed to alleviate suffering and anxiety. They rejected the traditional Greek value system, focusing on inner goodness rather than on external rewards. Developing inner goodness was the only way to live a happy and fulfilled life. In this class, we read Greek tragedies by Sophocles and Euripides that represent traditional Greek values. We examine the values, motivation, and choices of tragic characters who faced difficult ethical dilemmas - choices that led to misery and ruin. What were their tragic flaws? Could they have avoided their fates by adopting a different value system? We also examine the ethical theories of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. We analyze their discussions of justice, courage, friendship, love, and self-knowledge. Do these philosophical theories offer a valid way to live a happy life? Can we develop these virtues? If so, how do we do this? Do we need to have these virtues to live a happy life? Do the ancient philosophers offer useful solutions to ethical questions in our own day? Can their philosophies help us to become better and happier people?",

Humboldt considered a liberal arts education to be both a foundational and transformative process in the development of the self, and he was convinced that it was essential in creating moral and ethical citizens in an increasingly global world. From his point of view, the cultivation of oneself leads to the freedom of thought, freedom to act, freedom to assert oneself as an individual, freedom to access knowledge, and freedom to determine one's own role in society. In this course we will explore Humboldt's concept of education and examine the ways in which it is reflected and refracted in debates about university education still today.

        "course_description": "This course considers education not as training in external knowledge or skills but as a lifelong process of development and growth in which an individual cultivates her or his spiritual, cultural and social sensibilities. This concept of education - education as a formative and transformative process in the development of the self - is called Bildung in German and has a long tradition reaching back to the Middle Ages. The term first appears in the writings of the mystic Meister Eckhart who defines it as self-composure which he regards as a crucial stage in our spiritual development. The concept of Bildung takes on a secular meaning in the Reformation, when Ulrich von Hutten first coined the phrase that has become Stanford's motto: \"Die Luft der Freiheit weht\". (The wind of freedom is blowing). What he meant is that the cultivation of oneself leads to the freedom of thought, freedom to act, freedom to assert oneself as an individual, freedom to access knowledge, and freedom to determine one's own role in society. This idea of education as an internal and transformative process is central to debates in the nineteenth century (both in Germany and the United States) in which self-reflection is seen as key to the cultivation of an individual's identity and to her or his role as a member of society. In this course we will read reflections on education as self-fashioning by some of the greatest German thinkers spanning from the Middle Ages to the present. We will also enjoy some contemporary parodies of such reflections. These readings and our discussions will help us to understand Stanford undergraduate education as a transformative process of self-realization in our global society.",

This clerkship exposes a student to general and specialty based urology (oncology, female neurourology, pediatric urology, endourology, and minimally invasive surgery, make sexual dysfunction). During the clerkship, students learn broad concepts regarding the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of the common diseases of the genitourinary tract. Students in this clerkship are an integral part of the service. Every effort is made to provide students with as much personal contact with faculty and residents as is possible and appropriate for positive patient care. The daily clinics of the various faculty expose students to ambulatory urological care and provide them with an opportunity to take urologic histories and physicals.

The student will be actively involved with responsibilities in the operating room, the outpatient clinic and the inpatient ward. The clerkship emphasizes common benign and malignant diseases of the genitourinary tract in adults. In addition to broad exposure to the field of urology, special emphasis is placed on causes and treatment of urinary tract obstruction in the adult, urinary stone disease, genitourinary oncology, and management of neurogenic bladder and its complications in the spinal cord injured patient. General aspects of preoperative evaluation, operative and postoperative care of the surgical patient are also emphasized, and as such, this is an excellent first surgical rotation. In addition to the clinical experiences, there are weekly conferences in GU Radiology, GU Pathology, GU Oncology, as well as didactic sessions on selected topics in urology throughout the course.

There is a close relationship with the junior and senior resident in urology, allowing extensive clinic, ward and operating room teaching experience. Fundamental concepts of urology are covered in clinics and on rounds, but most valuable is the expected ancillary reading related to individual patient diseases and problems. This provides immediate feedback and motivation for conceptual understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of urologic disease.

The general course layout draws equal parts on Koselleck's practice of \"conceptual history\" (Begriffsgeschichte) and on Jameson's \"cognitive mapping.\" After consideration of an important, if often under-appreciated precedent (the baroque), we turn our attention to the conceptual triad of subject, reason and critique, followed by that of revolution, utopia and sovereignty.

Usually the scholar has written about the artist and maybe the artist has suggested reading and viewing lists to the scholar. They've helped each other feel seen, and often be seen in a more literal way.The conversations will concentrate on these questions: How do artists and scholars work across the divide between practice and theory? How should you build your art world and who will be in it? The pairs will discuss their respective practices (art-making, writing, researching, community-building) and engage in conversation about the artist's work.

DESCRIPTION: Provides students with a clinical experience in the field of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery. Students are exposed to the techniques of examination of the ear, nose, nasopharynx, mouth, larynx, and neck. They will have clinical experiences with the hearing and vestibular system, maxillofacial trauma, facial cosmetics, pediatric otolaryngology, head and neck cancer, skull base surgery, sleep surgery, voice disorders, as well as the more routine problems of otitis media, head and neck infections, chronic sinusitis, and the like. As with most surgical services, emphasis is placed on the surgical experience; in addition, students will have ample exposure to the outpatient clinic and will be expected to actively participate in pre- and postoperative patient care including ward rounds. Interested students are encouraged to assist in the operating room and take an active role in selected surgical procedures if they demonstrate the necessary skills. The rotation is divided into weekly rotations among the following subspecialties: Head & Neck Oncology, Laryngology, Rhinology, Sleep Surgery, Facial Plastics, Otology & Neurotology, and Pediatric Otolaryngology. Students will be based at Stanford Medical Center, but may also be scheduled to rotate at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center and/or the Palo Alto VA hospital. Students will be expected to round on all of the patients on the service to which they are assigned. Students must also attend resident education sessions held on Monday mornings and some Thursday afternoons, as well as grand rounds on Thursday evenings and medical student didactic sessions, held throughout the week. Students with interest in a specific subspecialty/service may indicate such to the course coordinator. The rotation is identical to the two-week subspecialty elective within the \nSURG 300A General Surgery Core Clerkship, therefore it may not be repeated by students who have taken the subspecialty elective. Stanford students who have taken the subspecialty elective or visiting students who have taken a previous otolaryngology rotation and wish to have further otolaryngology experience should enroll in \nOTOHNS 336A (Sub-internship in Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery) or \nOTOHNS 398A (Clinical Elective in Otolaryngology/Head & Neck Surgery Clerkship). Visiting students must be pre-approved for this course to be eligible. Please send a medical school transcript to Xiaoyu Feng, xyfeng@stanford.edu. Note: Students enrolling in this three-week course may neither repeat it, nor enroll in the subspecialty elective as part of \nSURG 300A. You will receive an email from Xiaoyu Feng the Friday before you start. PREREQUISITES: All scrub course/training needs to be completed prior to starting clerkship. PERIODS AVAILABLE: 1-12, full-time for 2 weeks, 2 students per period (availability depends on the number of sub-interns during the period). CLERKSHIP DIRECTOR: Uchechukwu Megwalu, M.D. CLERKSHIP COORDINATOR: Xiaoyu Feng, 650-497-3856, xyfeng@stanford.edu, 801 Welch Road, 2nd Floor.

Provides an in-depth review of intervention approaches for health promotion and disease prevention and covers the leading theories of behavior change. Follows an integrative model to demonstrate similarities and differences between the theoretical approaches, seeking what is useful and worthwhile in each theoretical model rather than looking primarily for what is most easily criticized. Practical in nature with emphasis on the specifics of needs assessments and intervention development and delivery and how these may vary across community settings, with diverse populations, addressing different behaviors, and leveraging traditional and emerging delivery channels. Explores intervention creation, delivery, effectiveness, and sustainability to identify and better understand the resources and other practical considerations necessary to produce, deliver, monitor, and disseminate an intervention with demonstrated effectiveness. Examples drawn from across the behavioral spectrum and include tobacco control, physical activity, healthy diet, stress and distress, as well as consideration of the complexities of extending interventions to target multiple risk behaviors. Students develop a foundational understanding of behavior change theory, rigorous research methods, and creative design strategies to advance the health of individuals and communities. Students taking 2 units only will complete all 4 homework assignments, attend 8 of 10 class sessions, and complete an abbreviated final abstract plus figures/tables instead of a final paper. The grading, in this instance, will be the medical school option of credit/no credit. CHPR master's students must enroll for 3 units and a letter grade.",

        "course_description": "The donor advised fund (DAF) is an increasingly popular vehicle for charitable giving. Donors receive a tax deduction when they contribute money or appreciated assets to a DAF; at their discretion, donors (DAF \"holders\") may advise the DAF manager, or \"sponsor,\" to distribute funds to tax-exempt charities. There are about 500,000 individual DAFs across the country, with total assets of over $100 billion. The major DAF sponsors are community foundations and the charitable arms of investment managers like Schwab, Fidelity, and Vanguard. Although donors can only \"advise\" rather than \"direct\" a sponsor to make a gift, their advice is almost always heeded. DAFs arguably incentivize giving by providing a vehicle for donating complex assets and reducing a donor's burdens by offloading administrative tasks to the DAF sponsor. Some DAF sponsors also offer advice to enable their DAF holders to give more effectively. Yet DAFs have been criticized on several grounds, and legislation has been introduced (but not enacted) to regulate them. One criticism is that while donors receive the tax deduction immediately upon contributing to a DAF, they can take as long as they wish to make gifts from the DAF, and even pass advisory authority on to their heirs, thus delaying putting the funds into the hands of charities that can use them. (In comparison, foundations are required to spend at least 5 percent of their assets annually.) Another criticism is that gifts made through a DAF can be anonymous, with only the DAF sponsor listed as the donor. (In comparison, gifts and grants by foundations must be reported on publicly available tax returns.) In addition, some DAF sponsors have concerns about requests to make gifts to putative hate groups: how to determine whether an organization falls in this category, and how to respond to the request if it does. At a time when the controversy around DAFs is only likely to grow, this Policy Lab practicum will provide an evidence-based analysis of the pros and cons of various self-reform and regulatory proposals. The research team will focus on understanding the perspectives of the recipients of DAF funding as well as those of DAF sponsors, DAF holders, regulators, and critics.

        "course_description": "Freshwater is our most crucial natural resource, but it is facing mounting pressures from climate change and other factors. While public agencies traditionally dominated water management, private water companies are playing an increasingly important (and sometime controversial) role. In many cases, private companies are making critical contributions to meeting societal water needs (e.g., by developing new technologies and finding new ways to reduce water use). In other cases, however, the involvement of private companies has proven controversial (e.g., when private companies have taken over public water supply systems in developing countries such as Bolivia). This course will look at established and emerging businesses in the water sector and the legal, economic, and social issues generated by the private sector's involvement. These businesses include water technology companies (e.g., companies commercializing new desalination or water recycling technologies), venture capitalists, water funds (that directly buy and sell water rights), consulting firms, innovative agricultural companies, and large corporations (that increasingly are adopting corporate stewardship programs). The course will begin with two weeks of introduction to water and the private water sector. After that, each class will focus on a different water company. Company executives will attend each class session and discuss their business with the class. In most classes, we will examine (1) the viability and efficacy of the company's business plan, (2) the legal and/or social issues arising from the business' work, and (3) how the business might contribute to improved water management and policy. Each student will be expected to write (1) two short reflection papers on businesses that visit the class, and (2) a 10- to15-page paper at the conclusion of the class on an idea that the student has for a new water company, on an existing water company of the student's choice, or on a legal or policy initiative that can improve the role that business plays in improving water management (either in a particular sector or more generally).

In this course we will explore a deepening societal intrigue with genetic accounts of personal identity and political meaning. Students will engage with varied interdisciplinary sources that range from legal cases to scientific articles, medical ethics guidelines, films, and anthropological works (ethnographies). We will explore several case studies where the use of DNA markers (as proof of heritage, disease risk, or legal standing) has spawned cultural movements that are biosocial in nature. Throughout we will look at how new social movements are organized around gene-based definitions of personhood, health, and legal truth. Several examples include political analyses of citizenship and belonging. On this count we will discuss issues of African ancestry testing as evidence in slavery reparations cases, revisit debates on whether Black Freedman should be allowed into the Cherokee and Seminole Nations, and hear arguments on whether people with genetic links to Jewish groups should have a right of return to Israel. We will also examine the ways genetic knowledge may shape different health politics at the individual and societal level. On this count we will do close readings of how personal genomics testing companies operate, we will investigate how health disparities funding as well as orphan disease research take on new valences when re-framed in genetic terms, and we will see how new articulations of global health priorities are emerging through genetic research in places like Africa. Finally we will explore social implications of forensic uses of DNA. Here we will examine civil liberties concerns about genetic familial searching in forensic databases that disproportionately target specific minority groups as criminal suspects, and inquire into the use of DNA to generate digital mugshots of suspects that re-introduce genetic concepts of race.",

Solid technical grounding and acquaintance with basic economics and business concepts will both be helpful. Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) will design a series of lectures, exercises, and interactive activities synthesizing integrative design principles. Students will be introduced to Factor 10 Engineering, the approach for optimizing the whole system for multiple benefits. Students will work closely and interactively with RMI staff including Amory Lovins, cofounder and Chief Scientist of Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI). Exercises will illuminate challenges RMI has faced and solutions it has created in real-world design. Students will explore clean-sheet solutions that meet end-use demands and optimize whole-system resource efficiency, often with expanding rather than diminishing returns to investments, i.e. making big savings cheaper than small ones.

Students will also meet several times during the quarter prior to the spring break portion of the course. E^3 will focus on efficiency techniques' design, performance, choice, evolution, integration, barrier-busting, profitable business-led implementation, and implications for energy supply, competitive success, environment, development, security, etc. Examples will span very diverse sectors, applications, issues, and disciplines, with each day covering a different energy theme: buildings, transportation, industry, and implementation and implications, including renewable energy synergy and integration. Solid technical grounding and acquaintance with basic economics and business concepts will both be helpful. Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) will design a series of lectures, exercises, and interactive activities synthesizing integrative design principles. Students will be introduced to Factor 10 Engineering, the approach for optimizing the whole system for multiple benefits. Students will work closely and interactively with RMI staff including Amory Lovins, cofounder and Chief Scientist of Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI). Exercises will illuminate challenges RMI has faced and solutions it has created in real-world design. Students will explore clean-sheet solutions that meet end-use demands and optimize whole-system resource efficiency, often with expanding rather than diminishing returns to investments, i.e. making big savings cheaper than small ones.

A hundred million people were killed by tobacco in the 20th century, and ten times that number \u00bf a billion people \u00bf are predicted to die prematurely from exposure to cigarette smoke over the next hundred years. How has tobacconcome to be labeled a global health crisis over the last decade and what has been the political response? From whence does activism and ongoing complacency regarding tobacco arise? How are they created in different cultural contexts?nnThis course aims to provide students conceptual tools to tackle two specific thought projects: (1) to understand how institutional actors compete to define a situation in the world today as a problem of global health, and (2) to understand the sociocultural means by which something highly dangerous to health such as the cigarette is made both politically contentious and inert. On both fronts, special attention will be given to the ways global health activism and complacency unfold in the U.S. and China.",

Indeed, though U.S. income inequality has increased, inequality has fallen around the world. However, by developed country standards, poverty remains pervasive. What has caused the decline in rates of poverty and can we expect further decreases or can we act to accelerate the improvements? One answer is that countries that have experienced inclusive growth, in which the growth of the economy (i.e., GDP) has elevated the incomes of the poor, have done better at creating jobs for the poor, especially in the private sector. Therefore, the class will consider the evidence on the factors that have contributed to inclusive economic growth in developing countries. A second answer as to why poverty has fallen, but remains at high levels, is that governments and aid agencies and foundations have targeted programs to the poor.

During the first quarter (winter), students select and characterize an important unmet healthcare problem, validate it through primary interviews and secondary research, and then brainstorm and screen initial technology-based solutions. In the second quarter (spring), teams select a lead solution and move it toward the market through prototyping, technical re-risking, strategies to address healthcare-specific requirements (regulation, reimbursement), and business planning. Final presentations in winter and spring are made to a panel of prominent health technology experts and/or investors.

Each treatment provides a unique perspective on at least one aspect of abortion, whether it be clinical, social, political or cultural.

Hawaii is at the forefront of changes in the electric grid and the uses of electricity, with an aspirational goal for 100% carbon-free electricity in 2045. Hawaii also has passed legislation that aspires to 100% fossil-free transportation by 2040. Significant growth of behind-the-meter solar generation with storage has led to opportunities for the better use of these resources for maintaining grid reliability, while also increasing concerns related to grid stability and social equity. Because of these factors, there is a heightened interest nationally from federal agencies, particularly Energy and Defense. We will consider the availability and viability of solar, wind, and geothermal resources, while also considering the economic impact on Hawaii of large-scale importation of oil for generating electricity and transportation. We will consider emerging questions related to the reliability and the resiliency of the grids on different islands in the State. All of these issues will be considered in the technical, societal, cultural, natural resource, and political milieu which is the unique nature of Hawaii. We will spend the first week on campus learning about energy and its context in Hawaii, then travel to various field sites in Hawaii, including a wind farm, a utility-scale solar farm, an oil-fired power plant, a waste-to-energy facility, wave turbine, an oil refinery, a synthetic gas production facility, a biofueled thermal generator, a geothermal plant, and areas where natural resources are impacted by energy resource utilization. We will meet with relevant policy experts and public officials from governmental agencies, utilities, universities, and public interest groups.

Billions of people around the world lack adequate nutrition for healthy and productive lives, and obesity now exceeds hunger even in poor communities. Agricultural practices add to climate change, biodiversity loss, and other environmental harms, and freshwater and soils are widely depleted. Farmers who produce food in many parts of the world may lack the income to feed their own families. What's missing from this conversation about food and agriculture is fish, or more broadly, 'blue foods', animals and plants cultivated or captured in ocean and freshwater systems worldwide. This seminar will explore the role of blue foods in creating a sustainable and healthy global food system. It will build off The Blue Food Assessment - an international initiative led by Stanford with contributions from over 100 researchers from around the world - to explore the nutrition, environment, justice, equity, and climate dimensions of fish within the global food system. We will probe a wide range of questions, including: Do fish provide a healthier option than meat in all diets?; What is aquaculture all about, and is it sustainable?; Is seaweed the solution for a broken food system?; What is the role of blue foods in decarbonizing the food sector?; Are small-scale fish producers a small part of food systems - or a large part? Is food justice at risk in fisheries and global fish trade? How might the science of blue foods change national food policies? Is there a role for the private sector in developing healthy and sustainable blue foods? The class will be structured around readings, discussions, debates, essay-writing, and role playing as we seek solutions to global food system challenges through blue foods.",

At some level, all leadership right now is crisis leadership - getting one's team and organization through unprecedented times. Sometimes the ability to lead through these changes is due to talent; other times, luck plays the more important role. Technological and political changes are upending assumptions and conventional wisdoms that have guided the world for decades. Tomorrow's business leaders need to navigate multiple dimensions and horizons in order to guide their organizations to success: they need to excel in strategy and execution, understanding details and context, navigating digital and physical, and many other dualities. This course explores how leaders at the world's leading companies are driving frame-breaking transformational change inside of organizations that have grown up with a physical foundation, or who have a digital foundation and are moving into the physical domain as a new entrant. The issues facing business leaders across multiple industries require insights on how to drive technological, cultural and ecosystem changes under unprecedented duress. The changes brought about by these dynamics require the development of new types of leaders which we call Systems Leaders. These people seek to maximize and thrive in the chaos of the times. Systems Leaders are adept at systems thinking - in having the ability to analyze the complexity in markets and organizations by paying attention to how the component parts interrelate to each other. The course will delve into the need for systems thinking at multiple levels - of products, organizations, cultures and individuals. By systems thinking we mean having a thorough understanding of how customer success is optimized by knowing how all of the elements of an organization work with both internal and external constituents.

The 2023 Challenge, \"Data Science for Subseasonal Forecast\", centers on climate change and is in partnership with Climate Change AI (CCAI). Accurate long-term forecasts of temperature and precipitation is crucial for mitigating the effects of climate change (i.e. preparing for droughts and other wet weather extremes). Such forecasts can potentially impact many industries (e.g. agriculture, energy, disaster planning) in countries across the globe. Currently, purely physics-based models dominate short-term weather forecasting. But these models have a limited forecast horizon. The availability of meteorological data offers an opportunity for data scientists to improve subseasonal forecasts by blending physics-based forecasts with machine learning. To learn more, visit: \nhttps://www.widsconference.org/datathon.htmlStudents may participate in this independent study in teams of 1-4.

To take advantage of possible creative sparks at the art/science interface, it is necessary for fuzzies and techies to have some knowledge of the language used by the other side. This interface will be explored through examining approaches used by an artist and an engineer in the context of the materials science of cultural objects. In-class lectures, hands-on studio practice, and field trips will be used to illustrate these different perspectives. At the heart of the scientific approach is the notion that a cultural object, e.g., a painting, is a physical entity comprising materials with different physical properties and different responses to environmental stresses presented by light, heat, and water. In support of this outlook, in-class lectures and discussions will focus on the basic concepts of color, optics, mechanics, composite structures, and response of the object to environmental stress, and we will visit Bay Area museums to see how artists employ such techniques. The hands-on studio experience is designed to increase students' confidence and develop their appreciation of differences in materials. It is not necessary to have any artistic training, only a willingness to experiment. The in-class studio projects will include working with line and shadow; color, binders, and mordants; global sources of pigments; substrates and writing; and material failure. Students will make one technical presentation on a topic in one of the five areas relevant to a painting: color, optics, mechanics, composites, and stress response. In addition, they will prepare one essay on the issues surrounding the intersection of art and science. Finally, they will complete a project related to one of the thematic areas covered in the hands-on studio sessions and make a final oral presentation describing their project.",

Topics will include the lives and legacies of the indigenous peoples that Lewis and Clark encountered more than two centuries ago; the historic fisheries that attracted thousands of Chinese and, later, Scandinavian workers; the New Deal\u00bfs epic dam-building initiatives beginning in the 1930s; the impact of the Manhattan Project\u00bfs plutonium bomb development at Hanford Atomic Works in WWII; and the twenty-first-century server farms dotted across the Columbia Plateau. We plan to visit with local water managers, farmers, ranchers, loggers, Native American fishermen, and energy administrators, as well as elected officials and environmental activists, to examine the hydrologic, meteorologic, and geologic bases of the River\u00bfs water and energy resources, and the practical, social, environmental, economic, and political issues surrounding their development in the Pacific Northwest region. \n\nThe Columbia River and its watershed provide a revealing lens on a host of issues. A transnational, multi-state river with the largest residual populations of anadromous salmonids in the continental US, it is a major source of renewable hydroelectric power. (The Grand Coulee dam powerhouse is the largest-capacity hydropower facility in the US; nearly 50% of Oregon\u00bfs electricity generation flows from hydropower; in Washington State it\u00bfs nearly two-thirds, the highest in the nation.) The river provides a major bulk commodity transportation link from the interior West to the sea via an elaborate system of locks. It irrigates nearly 700,000 acres of sprawling wheat ranches and fruit farms in the federally administered Columbia Basin Project. We will look at all these issues with respect to rapid climate change, ecosystem impacts, economics, and public policy. \n\nWe will begin with classroom briefings on campus, in preparation for the two-week field portion of the seminar. We plan to then travel widely throughout the Columbia basin, visiting water and energy facilities across the watershed, e.g., hydro, solar, wind, and natural gas power plants; dams and reservoirs with their powerhouses, fish passage facilities, navigation locks, and flood-mitigation systems; tribal organizations; irrigation projects; the Hanford Nuclear Reservation; and offices of regulatory agencies. We hope to meet with relevant policy experts and public officials, along with several of the stakeholders in the basin. \n\nOver the summer students will be responsible for assigned readings from several sources, including monographs, online materials, and recent news articles. During the trip, students will work in small groups to analyze and assess one aspect of the river\u00bfs utilization, and the challenges to responsible management going forward.

DESCRIPTION: The Neurology Core Clerkship is designed to train students in the systematic, logical approach to clinical neurology via the comprehension and application of the neurologic history and physical exam in the evaluation and management of neurological diseases. Responsibilities differ among the clerkship sites, however a common core of teaching and exposure to a variety of neurologic patients encounters and experiences will be presented to all students. Complete evaluation of neurologic patients through competent performance and interpretation of the neurologic history and examination and command of the practical knowledge of clinical conditions affecting the nervous system is anticipated by the end of the clerkship. Students are assigned to the following locations for training: Stanford Hospital Neurology Inpatient Wards; Stanford Neurology Adult Outpatient Clinics; Stanford Hospital Neurology Intensive Care Unit; Stanford Neurosurgery service; Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Child Neurology Inpatient Consultation service; Santa Clara Valley Medical Center (SCVMC) Neurology Inpatient Consultation and Outpatient Clinic services; the Palo Alto Veterans Administration (PAVA) Inpatient Consultation and Outpatient Clinic services. Selection of a 2 week experience at the Stanford Hospital Neurology Inpatient Ward, Stanford Hospital Neurology Intensive Care Unit, Stanford Neurosurgery, or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Child Neurology Consultation service sites will be automatically paired with a 2 week experience in the Stanford Neurology Adult Outpatient Clinics to ensures clinical exposure to both inpatient and outpatient neurology at every clerkship site and all these venues satisfy the core graduation requirement for the Required Neurology Clerkship. Regardless of site location, students are expected to attend the core didactics of the clerkship in person at Stanford School of Medicine main campus (or virtually during the COVID19 pandemic) that take place once weekly on Wednesdays and end at 6:00PM, as well as a mandatory in-person, full-day orientation on the first day of the period. Passing of the NBME Subject Exam in Neurology is a required component of the clerkship and materials for study are provided to each student in support of this effort. PREREQUISITES: None. For students requesting placement on neurosurgery service, preference is given to students who have completed the core surgical clerkship. However, student must have completed formal OR SCRUB TRAINING. Advanced students with clerkship experience are preferred for the neurocritical care (ICU) site placement. PERIODS AVAILABLE: 1-12, except Christmas break, 4-9 students per period. CLERKSHIP DIRECTOR: Veronica Santini, M.D., M.A., 954-632-8899, santiniv@stanford.edu.

        "course_description": "The average person in the United States uses ~25 tons (the weight of approximately 20 mid-size cars) of raw materials every year to maintain our modern lifestyle. These materials, especially metals, are mined from the rare and unique places where geological forces have concentrated such elements. Most people are well aware of the destruction that has been wrought by past and present mines to obtain these metals, and from an environmental standpoint are actively against many or all mining projects. Such an environmental stance may be difficult to maintain in the future, however, given the urgent need to combat the climate crisis. Put simply, the most likely path to eliminating fossil fuel use is the electrification of the world, or the 'green economy.' This new infrastructure (including energy generation, such as wind farms; energy storage, such as batteries; energy transport, such as electrical wires; and electrified everything, including cars, planes, tractors, lawn mowers, etc.) will require massive quantities of mineral resources in order to achieve at the necessary scale. It is estimated that the world will require annual production increases of ~450% for battery metals such as lithium or cobalt and increases of 10% for base metals such as copper to meet the demand in energy technologies predicted by 2050. This means increasing mine production by over an order of magnitude even for base metals. Further, once used in infrastructure these metals cannot be recycled, meaning that the path to our green future most likely involves more mining of these critical metals. The question then becomes how we can sustainably produce these mineral resources at the least societal and environmental cost. You will: Learn how geological forces create mineral deposits; Learn the basic geological history of Montana; Visit past an environmental Superfund site at a historical mine, and learn what is being done to remediate it; Visit existing mines to learn about the mine production process, environmental problems, and modern remediation techniques;Meet with mining, civic, and environmental stakeholders at a controversial mining project. This course will involve several days on Stanford campus learning about the scale of mineral resources predicted to be necessary for the green economy as well as basic ore geology. We will then travel to the Judson Mead Field Station in the Tobacco Root Mountains of southwestern Montana. This will be our home for a six-day fieldtrip exploring Montana geological history and mining issues. We will return to Stanford to complete a short research project on a controversial mine project, and investigate possible alternatives. Projects will be presented to the class and the broader SoCo community. While we may not reach conclusions to the multi-faceted question about how best to produce these resources, you will know the issues, problems, and possibilities associated with sustainably producing the metals needed for the green revolution.",

        "course_description": "Though marginalized through terms like 'superstition' and 'witchcraft,' magic remained a ubiquitous feature of the United States sociocultural and religious landscape well beyond the 1692 Salem Witch Trials. From dream books to horseshoes to conjure, phenomena once termed black or white magic in Western European and early Anglophone American cultures became a part of an expansive collection of ritual and material practices that occupied the margins of American 'religion' serving as a foil to more mainstream manifestations of the category. Racialized visions of magical creatures and capabilities from faraway places solidified understandings of magic as the province of non-Whites and non-Americans, contributing further to the category's marginalization, even as interest in spiritualism, mesmerism, and other metaphysical movements heightened in the nineteenth-century. The result was a religious milieu in which practices previously deemed 'magic' became entrenched within some mainstream institutional religions and the categorical lines between magic and religion became increasingly blurred in popular culture. Beginning with the religious history of American magic and moving towards the twentieth century, this course explores the American fascination with magic as expressed through the Marvel cinematic universe. Together, we will ask questions of how magic appears in the popular imagination, its role in the success of the Marvel franchise, and the terms on which we define the category.",

For Asian Americans, there are entanglements with colonialism in both the countries of their heritage and in the United States, complicating the scope of what it means to deal with colonialism. In this class we look at some of these relationships, thinking through the impact of various types of colonialism on history of Asian Americans, and their positionality alongside colonial structures in the United States. In doing so we look to unpack the nuances behind these interrelationships and the murky overlapping and underdiscussed dynamics that they create. We start the quarter with a discussion of what settler colonialism is, and key discussions of its intersections with the Asian American experience that emerged with the publication of Asian Settler Colonialism: From Local Governance to the Habits of Everyday Life in Hawai'i. We will then move to read our first two books of the quarter which focus on the intersections of Asian American labor and Indigenous erasure from the construction of the transcontinental railroad to the incarceration of Japanese Americans during WWII. From here we will pivot towards the Pacific and look to two books which seek to understand Asian American involvement with US colonial projects, and the wake of wartime and post-war resettlement. These works look past the North American continent to consider the ways in which transnational connections and diasporas become entangled with settler colonial projects.

Class time will be spent moving between core theories, listening sessions, discussion of current musical events, and an interrogation of students\u00bf own musical experiences. Students will undertake a number of short research and writing assignments that call on them to make sociological sense of music in their own lives, in the lives of others, and in society at large.",

We will read theoretical and historical texts and recorded dance as a means of developing tools for viewing and analyzing dance and understanding its place in larger social, cultural, and political structures. Special attention will be given to new turns in queer and feminist dance studies. This course blends theory and embodied practice. This means as we read, research, and analyze, we will also dance.

Ann Swidler's seminal work on culture* (1986) states that people use culture as a toolkit in unsettling times as a way to cope with change. Inside this toolkit, there are culture practices, including organizational habits, routines, rituals, and stories, which help run meetings, work processes, and human relationships. This class will tackle how organizations can build strong, human-centered cultures to address the urgent challenges of our times. The class will combine two areas: organizational culture and human-centered design. It starts with the premise that an organization's culture is shaped not only by executives, and managers, but also individual employees. Students will learn a holistic, participatory approach to culture-making, by covering both top-down and bottom-up initiatives to improve culture. This course's format is based on understanding and internalizing theory, by applying its key concepts to reflection exercises, and design projects. In this class, students will first survey theories, methods, and case studies to learn how organizational culture is built and changed. They will then reflect on these theories and methods. Then they will use a human centered, iterative design process to build an understanding of organizational culture through group projects throughout the semester. on burning topics of current organizational culture, including high-performance, creativity, equity, diversity, and wellbeing.",

Regulatory bodies like Public Utility Commissions (PUC) have unintentionally institutionalized this effect, with sometimes disastrous results, when in fact these isolated systems interact in ways that create new opportunities and new challenges. Infrastructure can be made more flexible and resilient but only when we know how to design, interconnect, and operate urban systems as an integrated whole, and when quality of life is the explicit motivation. These systems include Energy, Transportation, Communication, Water, Air, Green Space and Geophysical systems.nnThis class will introduce the basics of current infrastructure systems and explore in greater depth how these systems can be integrated in design and in operations. During the first half of the quarter, class lectures and guest speakers will develop the principles of infrastructure design and operations. The focus of the second half of the quarter will be directed student research to explore in greater detail the integration of two or more infrastructure systems, concluding with a written paper and class presentation.nnAt the end of this course students will have a framework for understanding integrated infrastructure design from multiple engineering and civic perspectives. Specific topics will be: n- Boundaries and boundary conditions between Built Urban Infrastructure Systems and Natural Urban infrastructure Systems n- Materials and Energy Flows between Built and Natural Urban Systemsn- Quantifying and Normalizing Urban Materials and Energy Flowsn- Basis of physical control of Infrastructure Systemsn- Basis of legal and economic control of Infrastructure systemsn- Metrics to evaluate single system and integrated system performancenStudents must submit an application for admission to this course: \nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxTP9MWxbOMJOYXOA3kK1ZWAPJHCkptxaXfGQ80o0Nz7d6cA/viewform?usp=sf_link",

The 2023 Challenge, \"Data Science for Subseasonal Forecast\", centers on climate change and is in partnership with Climate Change AI (CCAI). Accurate long-term forecasts of temperature and precipitation is crucial for mitigating the effects of climate change (i.e. preparing for droughts and other wet weather extremes). Such forecasts can potentially impact many industries (e.g. agriculture, energy, disaster planning) in countries across the globe. Currently, purely physics-based models dominate short-term weather forecasting. But these models have a limited forecast horizon. The availability of meteorological data offers an opportunity for data scientists to improve subseasonal forecasts by blending physics-based forecasts with machine learning. To learn more, visit: \nhttps://www.widsconference.org/datathon.htmlStudents may participate in this independent study in teams of 1-4. To qualify for official participation in the datathon, at least half of each team must identify as women.

        "course_description": "American democracy is increasingly polarized and dysfunctional. Levels of public trust in the Congress and politicians are at virtually all-time lows, and so is the ability of members of different parties to work together in Washington, D.C., and in many state capitols, to find solutions to our major public policy problems. Much is written about the growing polarization of American society, yet public opinion polling suggests that the public is not as bitterly divided as the political class. \nnOne perspective on the current crisis stresses the lack of opportunities for the American public to deliberate on key issues and challenges under good conditions - where they can receive balanced and informed briefings and talk with one another face to face, away from the glare of broadcast media and social networks that only reinforce their initial points of view. 'Good' conditions also provide trained moderators to encourage and ensure mutual respect for divergent points of view. When a representative, random sample of a population - be it a city or an entire nation - is brought together in this way to deliberate, while being polled on their opinions before and after deliberation, new insights emerge about what decisions 'the people' collectively might come to if they could talk in one room together as fellow citizens. We call this innovative method of democratic dialogue and opinion formation 'Deliberative Polling.' It has been used over 100 times in over 30 countries to help register public opinion in a more democratic and constructive fashion.nThis course will first examine basic theory on deliberative democracy, with emphasis on the state of polarization in American democracy and the issues that appear to most bitterly divide the American public. Then it will study the method of Deliberative Polling and look at a number of specific instances where it has been applied to help inform public policy dialogue or decision-making. We will read studies evaluating applications of Deliberative Polling in cities and countries around the world. We will watch documentary films describing the experience with deliberative polls in several settings. We will examine in detail some of the statistical polling results from previous Deliberative Polls to determine whether and why (and to what extent) people change their opinions on policy issues as a result of the deliberative process. As hands-on experience, students will prepare briefing materials and surveys for an upcoming Deliberative Polling experiment that will be implemented by a cross-institutional deliberative democracy practicum course that is being led by Stanford's Center for Deliberative Democracy and the Haas Center for Public Service. They may also contribute to the planned state wide deliberation on the future of California. In addition, students will engage in their own deliberations using the Stanford Platform for Online Deliberation, which has been deployed around the world. Students will complete background reading over the summer and will write short papers during the course analyzing specific previous experiences with Deliberative Polling.",

Students will be introduced to concepts such as participatory culture, microcelebrity, and platform politics. We will grapple with questions such as: how have YouTube's new technological features shaped the culture of the platform, and vice versa? How does community function on the platform, and how has that changed over time? And how have YouTube's content policies affected each of these dynamics?

In this course, we will explore this question through a broad interdisciplinary lens, drawing lessons from the social sciences and history. We will ask what national identity is, where it comes from and why it has such appeal for humans. We will go back to the roots of nationalism in early modern Europe in order to understand the historical origin of national identities.

Born in the age of the crusades and ultimately conquered by the Ottoman Empire, the Mamluk Sultanate can be understood as a bridge between the worlds of medieval and early modern Islam, as well as between East and West, sitting astride the major Nile-Red Sea route that linked the Mediterranean world to that of the Indian Ocean and beyond.

Because most organizations are not democracies, movements must find ways to penetrate their closed boundaries if they are to have an influence inside organizations. At the same time, social movements create organizational structures that help them carry out their goals, reproduce their missions and tactics, and effectively generate collective action. The purpose of this course is to examine the complex relationship between social movements and organizations. In order to understand the empirical link between movements and organizations, we will rely on social movement and organizational theory. Like the phenomena they seek to explain, these theories are strongly intertwined. In this course, we will cover topics related to how movements use organizations to propel change, and topics related to how movements help generate social change by targeting organizations. We will also evaluate the theoretical developments at the nexus of these two literatures, identifying the major innovations as well as looking for new research opportunities.",

We not only identify such cinematic details, but also consider how they contribute to the overall meaning of a film. Thinking about film and writing about film are intricately linked and inform each other deeply. Learning to write about film with sophistication requires a grasp of the mechanics of writing, familiarity with film terminology, and an understanding of film theory and history. This course helps you develop skills in critical viewing, reading, and writing.

Clearly, we know some media when we see them: radio, film, and television are in many ways paradigmatic media of the twentieth century. But what about the computational, networked media of the twenty-first century? Are these still media in the same sense, or has the nature of media changed with the emergence of digital technologies? And what, for that matter, about pre-technical media? Is painting a medium in the same sense that oil or acrylic are media, or in the sense that we speak of mixed media? Is language a medium? Are numbers? Is the body? As we shall see, the question of what a medium is raises a number of other questions of a theoretical or even philosophical nature. How is our experience of the world affected or shaped by media? Are knowledge and perception possible apart from media, or are they always mediated by the apparatuses, instruments, or assemblages of media? What is the relation between the forms and the contents of media, and how does this relation bear on questions of aesthetics, science, technology, or politics? The lecture-based course addresses these and other questions and seeks in this way to introduce a way of thinking about media that goes beyond taken-for-granted ideas and assumptions, and that has a potentially transformative effect on a wide range of theoretical and practical interests.nnnFilm & Media Studies majors and minors must enroll for 5 units.",

Specifically, we examine strategies for communicating through video, and we conduct hands-on exercises using digital video editing software to construct arguments, analyses, and interpretations of film, television, video games, online media, art, and culture. Compared with traditional text-based arguments, the video essay offers a remarkably direct mode of communicating critical and analytical ideas. Video essayists can simply show their viewers what they want them to see. This does not mean, however, that it is any easier than an essay composed with ink and paper. Like the written essay, the new technology introduces its own challenges and choices, including decisions about organization of space and time, audiovisual materials, onscreen text, voiceover commentary, and visual effects. By taking a hands-on approach, we develop our skills with editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro and Apple's Final Cut Pro while also cultivating our awareness of the formal and narrative techniques employed in cinema and other moving-image media. Through weekly assignments and group critique sessions, we learn to express ourselves more effectively and creatively in audiovisual media. As a culmination of our efforts, we assemble a group exhibition of our best video essays for public display on campus.nNo previous experience is required, but a willingness to learn new technologies (in particular, video editing software) is important.",

Interrogating the persistent Euro-centric vision in ethnographic cinema and its production of a primitive subject, we situate similar colonial fashioning in Classical Hollywood films of this period. Not only is colonial gaze projected through vision, but also through the arrival of mechanically reproduced sound. Films from the newly independent colonies help us examine the push and pull for representation and autonomy in global and local markets. Towards the end of this period, we see the emergence of a fully formed postcolonial cinema through the Third Cinema movement in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.",

Discussions of molecular structure will describe bonding models including Lewis structures, resonance, crystal-field theory, and molecular-orbital theory. We will reveal the chemistry of materials of different dimensionality, with emphasis on symmetry, bonding, and electronic structure of molecules and solids. We will also discuss the kinetics and thermodynamics that govern reactivity and dictate solubility and acid-base equilibria. A two-hour weekly laboratory section accompanies the course to introduce laboratory techniques and reiterate lecture concepts through hands-on activities. Specific discussions will include the structure, properties, and applications of molecules used in medicine, perovskites used in solar cells, and the dramatically different properties of materials with the same composition (for example: diamond, graphite, graphene).

NFTs, made possible by blockchain, are radically redefining the art world's commercial boundaries, social dynamics, and even what constitutes an artwork. How do NFTs work? What lends legitimacy to NFT artworks when digital materials can easily be copied via 'Right Click Save'? How does the blockchain alter and reinforce ideas of scarcity, authenticity, and authorship of artwork? How are artists engaging with and reacting to this new technology? How are museums, galleries, and market forces responding? Through guest lectures and discussions, this student-initiated course will provide a foundational understanding of technologies driving the NFT phenomenon and delve into its implications on contemporary artists and the art world.",

Not surprisingly, they have also been important to theory and practice in biodiversity conservation. The fascinating adaptations of organisms to the unusual, isolated ecosystems of the archipelago have left them particularly vulnerable to perturbations and introductions from the outside. Drawing on lessons learned from Darwin's time to the present, this seminar explores evolution, conservation, and their connection among the habitats and organisms of Gal\u00e1pagos. Using case-study material on tortoises, iguanas, finches, \nScalesia plants, penguins, cormorants and more, we will explore current theory and debate about adaptation, speciation, adaptive radiation, sexual selection, and other topics in evolution. Similarly, we will explore the special challenges Gal\u00e1pagos poses today for conservation, owing to both its unusual biota and to the increasing impact of human activity in the archipelago. \nThis course includes, at no additional cost to students, an intensive eleven-day expedition to Gal\u00e1pagos, provided that public health conditions permit. The goal of the expedition is both to observe firsthand many of the evolutionary adaptations and conservation dilemmas that we have read about, and to look for new examples and potential solutions. A chartered ship from Lindblad Expeditions, with the highest levels of COVID protection protocol, will serve as our floating classroom, dormitory, and dining hall as we work our way around the archipelago to visit eight different islands. For this portion of the class, undergraduates will be joined by a small group of Stanford alumni and friends in a format called a Stanford \"Field Seminar.\" Because our class time on campus is limited to one week before travel, students will be required to complete all course readings over the summer. \nnThe course emphasizes student contributions and presentations. Students will be asked to lead class discussions and to carry out a thorough literature review of some aspect of the evolution and/or conservation of one or more Gal\u00e1pagos species. The final assignment for the seminar is to complete a seven- to ten-page paper about that review and to present its main findings in a joint seminar of undergrads and alumni as we travel in Gal\u00e1pagos.",

Is democracy compatible with a society comprising the multiple identities of caste, class, religion, ethnicity, occupational group, and gender? To understand how the intricacies of Indian society and elections reflect each other, this course delves into the multiple axes of socio-political mobilization in India. How do the politics of gender interact with deep-rooted patriarchies? How do Indian political parties use and misuse caste identities to influence electoral outcomes? How do historical religious fault lines manifest in the 21st century? This course will explore critical themes in Indian society through the lens of its elections.

We'll look in detail at key forces of evolutionary change, including natural selection, sexual selection, kin selection, and more, and we'll look at their leading products in adaptation and diversification. Students working singly or in small groups will take on such fascinating challenges as why do hammerhead sharks have a strange front end? Do flying squid really fly? How and why do pistol shrimp generate light underwater? How does the waved albatross thrive without a nest? Among aerodynamic cormorants, why is there one that does not fly? And why do you have a vermiform appendix? These and other peculiarities will help us understand pattern and process in evolution.

How do such understandings directly impact the physical healing but also the life decisions and emotions of individuals, from caregivers to patients? And finally, how do these affect social transformation as part of healing? This course examines the art of COVID-19, from a contemporary and historical perspective, using the tools of Health Humanities, a relatively new discipline that connects medicine to the arts and social sciences. Materials for this course include art from different media (from poetry and fiction to performance and installation), produced during COVID-19 in mostly Western contexts, in diverse communities and with some forays into the rest of the world and into other historical moments of crisis. They also include some non-fiction readings from the disciplines Health Humanities draws from, such as history of medicine, anthropology, psychology, sociology, cultural history, media studies, art criticism, and medicine itself. We will thus be introduced to basics of Health Humanities and its methods while addressing the pandemic as a world-changing event, aided by the unique insights of artists.

After finding the roots of Italian horror in Dante and Boccaccio's descriptions of Hell and the plague, we will then focus on horror in more recent Italian literature, comics, and cinema - covering supernatural sources, such as a haunted dance school, and horrifyingly real ones, such as the concentration camp. Centering on the Italian twentieth and twenty-first century, this class introduces students to a genre which is also, at the same time, an experience - and vice versa. Participants will reflect on questions such as: why and how do we represent horror? Is there anything philosophical about horror, and can we learn anything from it? Does horror presuppose gore or monsters, or specifically belong to certain canons and motifs? Are we all equally exposed to horror or can it be, for instance, a gendered experience?

This class will use South Korea as a case study to think historically and geographically about race and gender through the following topics: when did racial discourses begin to emerge in Korea? What have been South Korea's significant encounters with the figure of the Other in its modern history? How were women implicated in the changing landscape of colonial Korea, the Korean War, Korea's Vietnam War experience, and compressed modernization? How have the influx of migrant labor and North Korean refugees impacted ideas about race in South Korea? And finally, what does K-pop tell us about shifting South Korean views of race and gender?

        "course_description": "You've finished your first year of university. You have taken the required first year courses, you hope you have explored enough, you are anxious about choosing a major. You know the campus fairly well, you have perhaps made some friends, you have some sort of routine. But you have the nagging feeling that so much of this is simply an illusion. The question then becomes, do you throw your faith, mind, and your body into that illusion (everyone else seems to), or do you risk the chance of missing a step by spending some time in Sophomore College reflecting on the immediate past and the future, with others who have similar questions. You may feel that the generalizations you heard in Year 1 about liberal education seem remote from your life experiences; you may have wished you could have engaged in more in-depth discussions, but that there was not time or interest in approaching the subject matter as you would have wanted to. We are then faced with the very important question: What happens when 'diverse' populations are recruited to places like Stanford, and then asked to constrain or reshape their diversity for the sake of belonging? We will discuss how this small-scale exercise in intellectual exploration can be read as a correlate for how individuals and societies work. What kinds of identities, values, stories count, and which do not? Liberal ideologies and principles may sound nice, but liberalism tends to flounder when presented with practical real-world issues like employment, health care, police brutality, pandemics, environmental degradation, and yes, education. There are two required texts for the course, first, Brazilian educator Paolo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed. What Freire proposes is a way of teaching and learning that is the antithesis of what he calls the 'banking model of education.' The banking model works this way, schools deposit learning into your account, and you withdraw it when you need it. Little, if any thought, is placed upon what exactly that currency is, and why it's of any value. Freire's pedagogy is exactly the opposite-people act together to determine their learning goals - what they want to accomplish in the world--negotiate how best to arrive at those goals. They belong to the community because they are the creators of that community. The second texts are essays by the seminal Black feminist scholar, bell hooks. Author of more than 30 books, hooks started life in poverty in rural Kentucky, then won admission to Stanford, and went on to be a prolific writer, educator, and activist. She was deeply influenced by Freire. Ultimately, the task that both Freire and hooks addressed was to alter the condition of oppression through approaching the idea of education in a radically different manner. All remaining readings, activities, speakers, will be the product of our collective discussions come to the first day of class with your ideas, thoughts, and music (see below). This summer we will aim to do the following: Get to know and trust each other, and to support each other's explorations, questions, tentative answers. Pause and reflect on things that we feel we have not been able to really grapple with yet. Learn how others have challenged normative ideas about what an educational community might look like. Think of ways of sustaining our support for each other into the sophomore year.",

Students will assess the emergence of sophisticated `new generation' trade agreements that go beyond the liberalization of trade in goods and services towards upholding labor and environmental standards and ensuring that competition is conducted fairly by avoiding countries undercutting each other on regulation. Trade initiatives in India and China, trade agreements and trade strategy in Africa and Latin America, the European trade agenda, US trade leadership, and the US China trade war will be discussed. The course will also cover the proliferation of unilateral sanctions and export controls that are currently shaping the international trade agenda. Additionally, the course analyses the attempts to address technology/data transfers and cybersecurity in bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, despite regulation in those areas still being developed at a national level.

Working with Circa's Artistic team and ensemble performers, students will be required to participate in three weeks of rehearsal to learn the show and perform. Students will also work with Circa's Artistic Director, Yaron Lifschitz, during final rehearsals and in season. Aleta Hayes will offer a supportive curriculum exploring the artistic themes of collaboration, movement, and using art to express the human experience. Curriculum will also focus on the emotional and physical aspects of mounting a complex performance.Circus studies within the academic field of performance studies is a heavily under-researched area. The 19th century circus offers fascinating histories of race and gender in performance. The history of the circus is also a history of technology and coincides with the industrial revolution's persistent push to merge the human and the machine - the constant attempt to test and push against the boundaries of humanity's frailties and mortality. Contemporary circus draws from current cultural aesthetics, street vernacular, movement improvisation-- blurring lines between dance, theater and circus. We will look at pioneers of the genre including Cirque Du Soleil, Pickle Family circus, Archaos and more recent examples like the Tiger Lillies, the Lucent dossier Company and others. The art of circus is taken in an exciting new direction as 36 performers hang from a grid suspended in the air and propel themselves across the stage, tumbling, balancing and soaring together. The dramatic power and extreme skill of Circa's trademark acrobatics thrillingly expose the tension between the mass and the individual in this epic theatrical event that is at once deeply moving and physically stunning. In these complex times, Leviathan offers hope by celebrating what can be achieved when we work together. This action-packed show connects the local with the global and the emerging with the visionary and genuinely pushes boundaries in a powerful new circus production. Please note that Arts Intensive and initial rehearsals with Circa will take place September 6-23. Additional evening rehearsals will be scheduled and required leading up to the September 30 and October 1 performances following Arts Intensive period.

        "course_description": "This course explores the rise, stakes, and ironies of literary stardom by focusing on one of the Bay Area's most notorious band of celebrity authors: the Beats. To some, Beat politics, styles, and philosophies have seemed dated for decades; and yet Beat writers maintain a weirdly broad staying power. Even now, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg remain pop-cultural touchstones, outsider-intellectual icons, and essential reading for teens and the highly educated. To get to the root of this phenomenon, we will consider what fame meant to literature and vice versa in the post-World War II era - a time when a rapidly changing media ecology, rising consumerism, and intensifying Cold War nationalism made for curious marriages: between avant-garde art and pop culture, between countercultural ambitions and commercial appropriation. Why did the Beats get famous? How did their fame affect the life and work of contemporaries (like the acclaimed but understudied poet Bernadette Mayer) who wrote in their long shadow? What can these dynamics teach us about celebrity and technology today? In answering these questions, we will examine Beat writers in print, on film and TV, in photographs and advertisements, and in the archive. Students will learn to work with a range of genres and forms including some criticism and theory by authors both inside and outside of the literary 'star system.'

Literature has long functioned as a kind of incubator for some of the most important concepts and metaphors that we use to understand the massive transformations that digital technologies have effected within modern life. In this class, we will read novels, short stories, and poetry from the last fifty years that try to capture the new forms of experience that these technologies' considered broadly under the rubric of 'the internet' have brought into being. Drawing on media-theoretical and Marxist approaches in particular, we will work together to develop a critical vocabulary for analyzing the two-way traffic between digital media and literary forms, from cyberpunk fiction to Instagram poetry.

        "course_description": "\"I am an invisible man,\" says the unnamed hero of Ralph Ellison's classic picaresque novel from 1952. Generically picaresque refers to works of satirical fiction that depict the episodic adventures of a likable roguish hero. This course will explore 20th-century American variations on the genre, focusing on three novels that feature seemingly invisible half-outsiders on the move through different settings and social spheres. What do these narratives suggest about the politics of visibility and marginalization? How do they employ satire, ridicule, wordplay, and irony to expose social corruption, hypocrisy, ignorance, and greed? How do they use a picaresque hero's half-outsider status to probe questions of equality and belonging based on race, gender, class, and ability? What do they suggest about the possibility of social acceptance for someone with a marginalized identity? We'll let these and other questions motivate our tour of 20th-century American picaresque and at the same time learn how the picaresque can help us understand literary history more broadly. Novels include Gentlemen Prefer Blondes by Anita Loos (1927), Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison (1952), and The Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo by Oscar Zeta Acosta (1974). Critics and theorists may include Mikhail Bakhtin, Claudio Guill\u00e9n, Susan Lanser, and Michael Hames-Garc\u00eda.

        "course_description": "\"Some historical phenomena need large-scale analysis,\" writes literary critic Wai-Chee Dimock. In this course, we will take Dimock's invitation as we study the far-reaching resonances of a text that might seem parochial: Henry David Thoreau's Walden. Thoreau's account of his 'experiment in living' for two years at Walden Pond proved polarizing when he first published it in 1854. Even today Thoreau can be read as either dangerously self-indulgent or radically self-reliant. But while his political thought is often associated with modern libertarianism, it has also shaped an active, deeply egalitarian form of civic engagement from the nineteenth century on. Indeed, the themes that cut across Walden and that anchor Thoreau's speeches and essays on civil disobedience have made him a writer with a direct influence on such twentieth-century revolutionaries as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. At the same time, Thoreau has played a foundational role in the development of environmental thought and ethics. In this course, we will read Walden slowly, pairing Thoreau's work with the contributions of other writers and activists whose work either references or resonates with Thoreau's, from the mid-nineteenth century to today. Bringing a comparative lens to topics ranging from abolitionism to environmentalism, we will consider the historical contexts and trajectories of these movements and attempt to articulate our own sense of ethical and political responsibility in the twenty-first century.

This course explores their innovations. Three texts will guide our exploration of semantics, semiotics, and rhetoric: Thomas Nashe's The Unfortunate Traveller (1594), Book One of Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene (1590), and Sir Philip Sidney's Defence of Poesy (1595).

Like both ChicanX and Puerto Rican literatures before it, LatinX Literature emerges from various movements for social justice to challenge both the Anglo and the Hispanic established literary traditions of the Americas. As a transnational, pluralistic, heterogeneous, and dynamic category that considers the writings of diverse peoples with cultural ties to Latin America residing in the U.S., it complicates and transgresses the linguistic, geopolitical and cultural borders of the Americas, including those of the Afro-Caribbean, Luso-Brazilian, and the Native First Nations. Aligning itself with the issues, styles, and topics of the Global South, LatinX Literature is a product of the kind of 'border thinking' that critic Walter Mignolo has described as a 'pluriversal epistemology that interconnects the plurality and diversity of decolonial projects.' Acknowledging its emergence from literal and theoretical border spaces and decolonizing epistemologies, the 'X' of LatinX intentionally inflects the link to an origin in LGBTQI discourses signifying 'a more inclusive, non-gender-binary designation for LatinX peoples' and as a border literature that articulates heterogeneous ways of making meaning.

How do such understandings directly impact the physical healing but also the life decisions and emotions of individuals, from caregivers to patients? And finally, how do these affect social transformation as part of healing? This course examines the art of COVID-19, from a contemporary and historical perspective, using the tools of Health Humanities, a relatively new discipline that connects medicine to the arts and social sciences. Materials for this course include art from different media (from poetry and fiction to performance and installation), produced during COVID-19 in mostly Western contexts, in diverse communities and with some forays into the rest of the world and into other historical moments of crisis. They also include some non-fiction readings from the disciplines Health Humanities draws from, such as history of medicine, anthropology, psychology, sociology, cultural history, media studies, art criticism, and medicine itself. We will thus be introduced to basics of Health Humanities and its methods while addressing the pandemic as a world-changing event, aided by the unique insights of artists. The course will culminate in final projects that present a critical and contextual appreciation of a specific art project created in response to COVID-19; such appreciations may be creative art projects as well, or more analytical, scholarly evaluations.",

So, how do religious people imagine what death is and what lies beyond? What guidance exists for the time of death and its aftermath? How is the body understood in relation to death and beyond - and how is it managed? How do the living coexist with the dead in various forms?

Is our freedom compatible with our being fully a part of the same natural, causal order that includes other physical and biological systems? What assumptions about freedom do we make when we hold people accountable morally and/or legally? When we hold people accountable, and so responsible, can we also see them as part of the natural, causal order? Or is there a deep incompatibility between these two ways of understanding ourselves? What assumptions about our freedom do we make when we deliberate about what to do? Are these assumptions in conflict with seeing ourselves as part of the natural, causal order?We will explore these and related questions primarily by way of careful study of recent and contemporary philosophical research on these matters.",

Put another way, provenance refers to all the individuals, communities, and institutions who have owned (both legally and illegally), kept, stored, exhibited, displayed, managed, and sold an art object. Knowledge of provenance can both inflate and deflate the value of an art object and it can also shed light upon legal and ethical questions including assessing repatriation and restitution claims for African art objects. Furthermore, by telling the story of how a particular object moved through multiple pairs of hands, often over the course of centuries and across several continents, we gain nuanced appreciation of the social currency of artwork as well as of changing perceptions of aesthetic and monetary value, and insight into the extractive dynamics of colonialism and postcolonial global economies. For this class, you will have the unique opportunity to work first hand with an important African art collection in North America: the Richard H. Scheller Collection at Stanford University. You will select one object from the collection and create a detailed provenance history, documenting and detailing its origins, its movement across space and time, and its arrival to the Scheller collection in Silicon Valley. You will use archival materials from Scheller\u00bfs collection, online databases and archives, and secondary literature. Your final project for the class will be to create a visual StoryMap that allows you to display your provenance history with narrative text and multimedia content.

This course, on the other hand, is regionally focused, practice-oriented, and addresses the ways in which human rights initiatives and projects are designed, developed, funded, implemented, and evaluated by the various actors and institutions that make up the complex landscape of human rights work. We will have several guest speakers who have successfully followed different career paths in the UN, NGOs, academia, philanthropy, and development. They also reflect engagement in a number of key areas of human rights practice: gender based violence and gender discrimination; statelessness; freedom of religion and expression in an electronic age; justice sector reform and the rule of law; business and human rights; prosecution and accountability for war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity.nnnThe requirements for an effective practice-oriented course dictate that it be of limited geographical scope while at the same time having a regional, and to a lesser extent, a cross-regional perspective. Accordingly, the focus of this course will be on the 10 Southeast Asian nations that make up ASEAN as a region with its own legal and institutional human rights framework. We will also consider some of the ways in which ASEAN human rights issues are connected to its neighbors and, in this case, particularly to South Asia (Rohingya) and China (human trafficking and environmental issues). nnnThe course will be structured around the following 5 main segments:nn(1) Issues: Overview of human rights challenges in ASEAN: What are the most pressing issues (and to whom); how is the human rights agenda defined at the national and regional levels; how are priorities established; what are the obstacles to effective implementation of the agenda? nn(2) Players: The roles of national and regional institutions; national NGOs and human rights activists; national human rights commissions; governmental and regional bodies; international human rights organizations; the UN and its various engaged institutions (UNDP, UNODC, UNHCHR, UNHCR, Special Mandates, Human Rights Committee, etc.); national development agencies and embassies.nn(3) Initiatives and Projects: How are broad national and ASEAN human initiatives developed? How do they come to be incorporated into specific projects (research, training and capacity building, awareness raising and education, accountability, etc.)? How are such projects developed and by whom? How are they awarded, funded and implemented? What is the role of human rights philanthropy? How are such initiatives and projects evaluated? What determines the success or failure of such projects and according to whom? nn(4) Seeking accountability for human rights abuses: case studies on trafficking; gender based violence and discrimination; ethnic, religious, or political conflict and violence. nn(5) Human rights careers at the national, regional, and international levels.",

Why do some songs become hits? What effects are technology and digital media having on the ways we experience and think about music? Course readings and lectures will explore the various answers to these questions by introducing students to key sociological concepts and ideas. Class time will be spent moving between core theories, listening sessions, discussion of current musical events, and an interrogation of students\u00bf own musical experiences. Students will undertake a number of short research and writing assignments that call on them to make sociological sense of music in their own lives, in the lives of others, and in society at large.",

These problems persist despite a long history of anti-inequality policy. What should be done? In an innovative $35M experiment, the state of California is testing bold new approaches to taking on poverty and inequality, including an unconditional 'guaranteed income' that assures that everyone can raise their children in healthy environments, invest in their skills, and take advantage of opportunities. The Stanford Guaranteed Income Team - a coalition of Stanford faculty - will be advising on the implementation and evaluation of this experiment (pending the state's final review of their grant application). Would you like to assist with one of the boldest anti-inequality experiments of our time? If you sign on for this course, you will (a) learn about the causes of poverty and other inequities and how they can be taken on, and (b) then assist with the implementation and evaluation of the experiment by interviewing potential participants. This course is not for the faint of heart. It will involve intensive training in qualitative interviewing and other types of research; it will require a commitment to be there for the people who have decided to participate in the experiment; and it will require a willingness to listen and learn with humility and respect.",

Topics will include the lives and legacies of the indigenous peoples that Lewis and Clark encountered more than two centuries ago; the historic fisheries that attracted thousands of Chinese and, later, Scandinavian workers; the New Deal\u00bfs epic dam-building initiatives beginning in the 1930s; the impact of the Manhattan Project\u00bfs plutonium bomb development at Hanford Atomic Works in WWII; and the twenty-first-century server farms dotted across the Columbia Plateau. We plan to visit with local water managers, farmers, ranchers, loggers, Native American fishermen, and energy administrators, as well as elected officials and environmental activists, to examine the hydrologic, meteorologic, and geologic bases of the River\u00bfs water and energy resources, and the practical, social, environmental, economic, and political issues surrounding their development in the Pacific Northwest region. \n\nThe Columbia River and its watershed provide a revealing lens on a host of issues. A transnational, multi-state river with the largest residual populations of anadromous salmonids in the continental US, it is a major source of renewable hydroelectric power. (The Grand Coulee dam powerhouse is the largest-capacity hydropower facility in the US; nearly 50% of Oregon\u00bfs electricity generation flows from hydropower; in Washington State it\u00bfs nearly two-thirds, the highest in the nation.) The river provides a major bulk commodity transportation link from the interior West to the sea via an elaborate system of locks. It irrigates nearly 700,000 acres of sprawling wheat ranches and fruit farms in the federally administered Columbia Basin Project. We will look at all these issues with respect to rapid climate change, ecosystem impacts, economics, and public policy. \n\nWe will begin with classroom briefings on campus, in preparation for the two-week field portion of the seminar. We plan to then travel widely throughout the Columbia basin, visiting water and energy facilities across the watershed, e.g., hydro, solar, wind, and natural gas power plants; dams and reservoirs with their powerhouses, fish passage facilities, navigation locks, and flood-mitigation systems; tribal organizations; irrigation projects; the Hanford Nuclear Reservation; and offices of regulatory agencies. We hope to meet with relevant policy experts and public officials, along with several of the stakeholders in the basin. \n\nOver the summer students will be responsible for assigned readings from several sources, including monographs, online materials, and recent news articles. During the trip, students will work in small groups to analyze and assess one aspect of the river\u00bfs utilization, and the challenges to responsible management going forward. The seminar will culminate in presentations to an audience of Stanford alumni in Portland, Oregon.",

Topics will include the lives and legacies of the indigenous peoples that Lewis and Clark encountered more than two centuries ago; the historic fisheries that attracted thousands of Chinese and, later, Scandinavian workers; the New Deal\u00bfs epic dam-building initiatives beginning in the 1930s; the impact of the Manhattan Project\u00bfs plutonium bomb development at Hanford Atomic Works in WWII; and the twenty-first-century server farms dotted across the Columbia Plateau. We plan to visit with local water managers, farmers, ranchers, loggers, Native American fishermen, and energy administrators, as well as elected officials and environmental activists, to examine the hydrologic, meteorologic, and geologic bases of the River\u00bfs water and energy resources, and the practical, social, environmental, economic, and political issues surrounding their development in the Pacific Northwest region. \n\nThe Columbia River and its watershed provide a revealing lens on a host of issues. A transnational, multi-state river with the largest residual populations of anadromous salmonids in the continental US, it is a major source of renewable hydroelectric power. (The Grand Coulee dam powerhouse is the largest-capacity hydropower facility in the US; nearly 50% of Oregon\u00bfs electricity generation flows from hydropower; in Washington State it\u00bfs nearly two-thirds, the highest in the nation.) The river provides a major bulk commodity transportation link from the interior West to the sea via an elaborate system of locks. It irrigates nearly 700,000 acres of sprawling wheat ranches and fruit farms in the federally administered Columbia Basin Project. We will look at all these issues with respect to rapid climate change, ecosystem impacts, economics, and public policy. \n\nWe will begin with classroom briefings on campus, in preparation for the two-week field portion of the seminar. We plan to then travel widely throughout the Columbia basin, visiting water and energy facilities across the watershed, e.g., hydro, solar, wind, and natural gas power plants; dams and reservoirs with their powerhouses, fish passage facilities, navigation locks, and flood-mitigation systems; tribal organizations; irrigation projects; the Hanford Nuclear Reservation; and offices of regulatory agencies. We hope to meet with relevant policy experts and public officials, along with several of the stakeholders in the basin. \n\nOver the summer students will be responsible for assigned readings from several sources, including monographs, online materials, and recent news articles. During the trip, students will work in small groups to analyze and assess one aspect of the river\u00bfs utilization, and the challenges to responsible management going forward.

In addition, we will spend a day visiting the battlefields of Gettysburg (July 1863) in Pennsylvania, and the Little Bighorn (June 1876) in Montana. The course's battlefield tours are based on the \"staff rides\" developed by the Prussian Army in the mid-1800s and employed by the U.S. Army since the early 1900s. While at Stanford, students will conduct extensive research on individual participants at Gettysburg and Little Bighorn. Then, as we walk through the battlefield sites, students will brief the group on their subjects' experience of battle and on why they made the decisions they did. Why did Lt. General Longstreet oppose the Confederate attack on the Union Army at Gettysburg? What was the experience of a military surgeon, vivandiere, or nurse on a Civil War battlefield? What role did just war principles or law play in the treatment of enemy fighters and civilians? Why did Custer divide his 7th Cavalry troops as they approached the Little Bighorn River? What was the role of Lakota Sioux women after a battle?

Writers played an important role in these conflicts, usually not as frontline combatants (though it was a former poet who led the genocide in Bosnia) but rather because literature was called upon to explain the failures of the past and disasters of the present, to build up national identities that were newly autonomous yet under attack, or even to recreate a sense of multinational solidarity. In this class we will read literature connected to two wars in which smaller states have faced the violent designs of their more powerful neighbors: the invasion of Bosnia by Serbia (and Croatia) in the mid-1990s, and the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Readings will include works by Miljenko Jergovi, Dubravka Ugrei, Saa Stanii, Serhiy Zhadan, and Andrey Kurkov, in English translation.",

Many writers and intellectuals responded to the burning issues of social justice, inequality, egalitarianism, and exploitation associated with capitalism and socialism. Through close reading, critical thinking, and analytical writing, we will engage in the critical discussions of class struggle, individual interest versus collective values, race, and social equality, and identify points of convergence and divergence between the two systems. To what extent was the opposition between capitalism and socialism fueled by the artistic vision of the great Russian and American writers? What was these thinkers' ideal of society and what impact did it have on shaping emerging socialism? Readings for the class include the fundamental works of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Jack London, W.E.B. Du Bois and Sholem Aleichem. The course will culminate in a digital mapping project visualizing intellectual connections between ideas and writers.",

Traces of these historical events, and countless others like them, survive in texts, manuscripts and archeological remains, and prompt the following questions: how did people of the past judge the \"authenticity\" of a religious conversion? What was the relationship between religion, culture, ethnicity, and race? Was religion an internal conviction, or a cultural practice? This course will explore conversions, both willing and forced, in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa from Antiquity to the Renaissance. Our exploration will focus on conversions among the three Abrahamic traditions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam",

We will explore different algorithms that create a wide variety of models, each with their own pros and cons. Through R programming exercises integrated across the course, we will apply these models to many different kinds of data sourced from urban development, education, business, etc. and analyze our findings. Based on individual interest, students will choose to investigate a specific research question using domain-specific data as part of a quarter-long project. Lastly, we will discuss important ethical debates on the possible uses of data and their implications in today\u00bfs world.

Although violence is pervasive in the Middle Sea's history, we will see that it was not always religiously motivated. We will thus explore other forms of tension such as wars between empires aspiring for global dominion (Spain and the Ottoman Empire), privateering, the exploitation of captive labour force, slave trade and the wars of colonial conquest. A theatre of multiform conflicts, the Mediterranean was also a crossroads where economic, commercial and political interests intersected. We will thus examine the ways in which these interactions contributed to the formation of multi-religious states and favoured religious syncretism and linguistic and cultural hybridizations.

Washington Post columnist James Hohmann will pull back the curtain on how the nature of campaigns, along with media coverage of American politics, is changing. During this exclusive seminar, students will engage directly with a bipartisan mix of today's most skilled political practitioners about what they've learned from their wins and losses. Guest speakers will include current and former officials from presidential, gubernatorial, Senate and House campaigns who have held senior roles, such as campaign manager, chief strategist, general counsel, admaker, speechwriter, opposition researcher, communications director, digital director, pollster, and policy director. The head of a leading Super PAC and the executive director of a party committee will help explore the vital functions of outside groups. Students will play the roles of senior officials for a tabletop exercise and write an end-of-term case study analyzing a major strategic decision by a campaign.

He also needs to figure out how to raise the debt ceiling and keep the government open, navigating brinkmanship that will spook the markets, while continuing to provide funding for the Ukrainian resistance to a Russian invasion despite growing GOP resistance to doing so. He'll have to manage this with the narrowest of majorities in the Senate and amid questions over whether he'll run again in 2024. But Biden is not the first president to deal with divided government. In fact, every modern president has dealt with this. In an exclusive seminar with Washington Post columnist and editorial writer James Hohmann, students will meet with key players in current and former administrations and Congresses who navigated these stormy crosscurrents. A special focus will be on how power is wielded in Washington and how cross-partisan coalitions get built.

The \"condition of England\" novels of the mid-nineteenth-century famously advanced the idea that a work of literature could aim to capture the nature of society as a whole, and, in particular, to convey the relationship between different social classes within England. Is it possible for a single novel, or film, or painting to represent society as a whole, or to show a nation to itself? What are the opportunities, and the pitfalls, of this kind of artistic project? We'll look at how this kind of project develops across two hundred years of British culture, from Victorian realism to contemporary multicultural fiction and film. Possible authors include Elizabeth Gaskell, Charles Dickens, George Orwell, Virginia Woolf, Mike Leigh, Stephen Frears, Zadie Smith.",

Far beyond simply providing a jaded reading public with scandalous and suspenseful narratives loaded with sex, crime, mystery and even the supernatural, these texts attempted to expose not only the secrets of their protagonists, but also the seamy underbelly of outwardly respectable Victorian society, epitomized by the family with its angel of the house. Topics for discussion will include the literary and moral value of these sub-genres of the novel and what they reveal about Victorian society's anxiety over transgressive - and therefore prohibited - elements in the domestic and public sphere.",

Psychologically this is the vanishing point of legal, moral, and religious proscriptions that have guided life to that point where, it is said, the soldiers becomes \"transparent\": all that one is or hoped or dreamt can be abruptly extinguished en toto. In this course we will examine the sociobiological, medical, psychological, and legal aspects of close combat: including the systematic preconditioning of soldiers for killing, the fraternal social milieu of the small combat unit and the impact on survivors who need to deconstruct that conditioning and social bond.

How much can you learn about risk for mental health problems from your DNA? This course will provide the foundational genetic and statistical information necessary for understanding the current and future capabilities of personal genomic predictions for mental health outcomes including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. We will also explore the ways in which genetic data can reveal where our ancestors lived as well as the consequences of a lack of diversity in genetic databases.

Put another way, provenance refers to all the individuals, communities, and institutions who have owned (both legally and illegally), kept, stored, exhibited, displayed, managed, and sold an art object. Knowledge of provenance can both inflate and deflate the value of an art object and it can also shed light upon legal and ethical questions including assessing repatriation and restitution claims for African art objects. Furthermore, by telling the story of how a particular object moved through multiple pairs of hands, often over the course of centuries and across several continents, we gain nuanced appreciation of the social currency of artwork as well as of changing perceptions of aesthetic and monetary value, and insight into the extractive dynamics of colonialism and postcolonial global economies. For this class, you will have the unique opportunity to work first hand with an important African art collection in North America: the Richard H. Scheller Collection at Stanford University. You will select one object from the collection and create a detailed provenance history, documenting and detailing its origins, its movement across space and time, and its arrival to the Scheller collection in Silicon Valley. You will use archival materials from Scheller\u00bfs collection, online databases and archives, and secondary literature. Your final project for the class will be to create a visual StoryMap that allows you to display your provenance history with narrative text and multimedia content.

It is also an area with a deep cultural, literary and artistic history. We will meet marine biologists, experts in the literary history of Cannery Row and the writings of John Steinbeck, local artists and photographers, experts in the neuroscience of creativity, as well as people who are very much involved in the forces and fluxes that steer modern culture. This rich and immersive approach provides students a rare opportunity to reflect on their relationships to nature, culture, and their own individual goals.nThe course emphasizes interactions and discussions. We will be together all of the time, either at our base at the Belden House in Pacific Grove, hiking and camping in Big Sur's pristine Big Creek Reserve on the rocky coast, and traveling to the Tassajara Mountain Zen Center in the Ventana wilderness for several days. This is not an ordinary academic experience, instead it is an adventure of a personal, intellectual, spiritual and physical kind. We welcome people with wide interests; artists, poets, writers, engineers, scientists and musicians. Mostly we invite people with an open mind and a sense of adventure. nStudents are expected to have read the several books provided as introductory material before the course begins, and each is also expected to become our local expert in an area such as plant identification, bird identification, poetry, weather prediction, photography, history, ethnography, etc. The course requires an individual research project of your choice on a topic related to the general theme.

You might consider, for example, words we speak, films we watch, buildings we use, political concepts we debate, styles we admire, myths we read. This course is our chance to explore such rich diversity, emphasizing the more material kinds of `classical remembrance. Our focus will be on California, its architecture, its collections of ancient objects. Readings, to be discussed in class, will inform our treasure hunt, which will start with Stanford University collections and proceed farther afield. Pandemic permitting, we'll visit the Getty Villa in Malibu, one of the world's foremost collections of ancient art housed in the imposing reconstruction of an ancient Roman villa. We'll archive our favorite discoveries, some obvious and some intriguingly obscure, in a digital museum which our class will co-create from scratch. But this will be a treasure hunt with a difference: while pursuing it we'll develop critical awareness about the very nature of ancient Greece and Rome and its legacies. Some of the questions to discuss are: What does the term `classical' convey? How might we weigh this supposed classicism against other traditions? Which ancient voices are heard and which remain silent? To whom do the legacies of ancient Greece and Rome belong? What are the ethics involved in collecting classical antiquities? How does antiquity `read' our very selves, individually and collectively? All are welcome, whether you're new to ancient studies or an old hand. Newcomers will get a uniquely experiential introduction to ancient Greece and Rome. Others will have the opportunity to deepen selected aspects of their classical knowledge. All students will emerge from the class with a broad overview of Greco-Roman pasts; will appreciate the range of human engagements with Greco-Roman antiquity, particularly in its local and regional manifestations; will understand the nature of the 'classical' in relation to other artistic traditions; will understand the role of ancient Greece and Rome in relation to fundamental human values and questions.",

Executive Order 13769, dubbed the \"Muslim Ban\", suspended the entry of citizens from multiple Muslim-majority countries and banned the entry of Syrian refugees indefinitely. The \"Muslim Ban\" coincided with the highest level of hate crimes against Muslims in America (91% increase in 2017 per CAIR). These levels are comparable to post-9/11 levels of hate crimes. Decades of research on minority communities has documented how stress associated with stigma, intimidation and discrimination is detrimental to physical and mental health. In this seminar we will explore the historical implications of Islamophobia and its modern-day impact on the global refugee crisis. Students will be introduced to the stigma that surrounds mental health in general and minority communities in particular. Special attention will be paid to the development of the nascent field Islamic Psychology and integrating Islamic spirituality into therapy as a means of addressing the under utilization of mental health services in Muslim populations. A combination of stimulating group discussions, talks by guest speakers, and field trips to community partners will provide students with different perspectives and a deeper understanding of these topics.

It will consider shared histories of Indigenous dispossession and struggles over land tenure, contests over sovereignty and the meaning of treaties, issues of citizenship and subjecthood, and efforts at the destruction of Indigenous culture through the criminalization of traditional religious practices and the forcible removal of Indigenous children; it will also explore histories of Indigenous resistance to settler policies. The course will conclude with a comparative survey of the law governing Indigenous communities in these settler states today, as well as ongoing struggles for Indigenous rights.",

        "course_description": "This seminar introduces students to the field of anthropology's intersection with Health, Illness and Medical Histories. Drawing on discourses in Body politics, feminist theories of health and medical anthropological approaches to research, this seminar series seeks to question and explore the nature of health realities in South Africa and Africa more broadly. Essentially, it provides an intersectional exploration into how health is comparatively conceptualised using anthropology as the model of analysis. The series is presented discursively and students' lived-experience and critical reflections are welcomed. Topics covered in the course include anthropological configurations of 'the body' (including phenomenology and biopower) as well as the history and geography of medicine (something of a broad sweep of the impact of European medicinal encounters in Africa). The theoretical approach adopted will consider postcolonial theory, development theory, and feminist theories to unpack health realities in South Africa and Africa more broadly. Typical to studies in health and well-being, the seminar series is interdisciplinary in its delivery and students are encouraged to engage critically with a broad range of literature and texts in order to grapple with the content. Thus, there are no prerequisites for doing the course and we welcome students with varying majors. The course will consist of weekly seminar sessions across 8 weeks (2 seminars per week, 16 seminar sessions in total)Instructor: Dr Efua Prah",

His innovative dramatic style (drawing orignally on improvisation, Brecht, and Greek tragedy,before shifting into realistic situations and dialogue);his apartheid-challenging collaborations with black South African theater artists (especially Zekes Mokei, John Kani, and Winston N'Tshona);and his extraordinarily long career (over the past sevendecades) makehis work of particular interest to students of history, theater, and politics. Through Fugard's plays, students confront signifcant issues in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa. Set in the confines of the theater, these confrontations paradoxically generate a fuller engagement with the issues than we often get from accounts in the disciplines of history orpolitcal science. As Picasso once said, \"Art is the lie that tells the truth,\" and Fugard's theater tries to do that. In studying his plays, students will learn a different kind of truth about social and historical realities that have faced South Africans over the past six decades.",

However, our ability to get large structures into space is limited by the size of modern rocket fairings, causing large space structures to be designed very differently from those on Earth. This seminar focuses on the design principles used by aerospace engineers to realize large space structures. Over the quarter, we will discuss techniques for deployable space structures folded on the ground and unfolded in orbit including origami, foldable thin structures, and inflatables. The seminar will also introduce students to current developments in space structures such as on-orbit assembly, in-space manufacturing, and reconfigurable space structures. We will examine the materials used in these structures, overview mathematical principles used for their design, and learn from past failures of deployable structures. The seminar will allow students to delve deeper into the concepts with hands-on experimentation, analysis of existing space structures (ex. James Webb, the ISS solar arrays, and CubeSat missions), and will allow students to practice written and oral communication skills.nnBy the end of the course students will be able to:nnExplain the need for large space structures.nnIdentify and compare the engineering approaches for the realization of large space structures.nnAnalyze the challenges associated with large space structures.nnDesign space structures using simple numerical models.",

To do this we explore the intellectual lineage of intersectional thought from its Black Feminist roots and trace it through its use today in education research. Within these tracings, we will delve into the (mis)uses, contestations, and iterations of intersectionality in theory and empirical research. At the heart of this course is an examination of how perceptions of and beliefs about a myriad of intertwining inequities conspire to create vectors of oppressions that land in multiply \"marginalized students\" lives through the macrosociolpolitcal to the microinteractional. It interrogates the foundational ideological assumptions around culture, difference, deficit, and dis/ability in which education has traditionally been rooted. Students in the course will analyze the lineage and processes of intersectionality to understand how students at the intersections of multiple oppressions experience education within communities of practice that enact, reproduce, and resist policies and practices through their daily activities.",

These data can then be used to score the severity of facial paralysis. If accurate in comparison to human landmark annotations, these measures will be compared to trained clinician scores of disease severity. In its final form, this algorithm will permit remote, accurate analysis of facial paralysis.

Few ever reach the patient - those that do have much more than an idea and an algorithm; they have an intimate understanding of the healthcare landscape and the technical knowhow to successfully integrate AI solutions into the medical system. In this course, we tackle the central question: How can young students find feasible and impactful medical problems, and build, scale, and translate technology solutions into the clinic. Together, we will discover the transformative technologies of tomorrow that we can build today. Please see the syllabus for more information. We encourage students of all backgrounds to enroll- the only prerequisite is a strong passion for technology in healthcare. Syllabus: rebrand.ly/aihealth",

This course will introduce students to the various definitions of global health from colonial times, through international health, tropical medicine, and now global health. We will consider what moral imperative leads to global health work, and how conventional thought about the relationships between providers, patients and systems in the global North and South is shifting. Global health has transitioned through various stages. In the 1800s, missionary doctors provided medical care while also spreading religion and colonial interests. During the twentieth century, great strides were made in sanitation and infectious disease treatment as part of systems and government based international health and tropical medicine. Paradoxically, in the last two decades, as the world becomes more intertwined, global health has generally involved shorter term encounters, usually with specialists at the vanguard. With the epidemiological transition and increasing communicable disease prevalence in developing countries, systems strengthening, and capacity building are the main priorities. It is argued that the current global health infrastructure does not focus on building long term partnerships or assign equitable worth to participants from the global North and South. We will investigate how effective our current efforts are and think critically about the meaning of decolonizing global health as regards population outcomes and the flow of resources. We will review each of these stages in global health development and use examples of long-term partnerships that have yielded considerable success, such as Partners in Health (PIH) and Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH). We will also briefly discuss overlapping concepts in global health equity and health and social justice in the US. Guest speakers from primary care fields and with global health backgrounds will stimulate further dialogue and speak from their experiences on the front lines.",

Even though those who suffer the most are located in the developing world, many of the policies, economic opportunities, and legal actions that offer the biggest potential for global poverty alleviation are made in the United States. This course will provide an introduction to the study of global poverty. What causes poverty? Why have some parts of the developing world done better at alleviating poverty than others? Can the world ever be free of poverty, as the World Bank's official motto suggests? How is the COVID pandemic affecting global poverty, and how should policymakers think about any potential tradeoffs? More generally, what can aspiring lawyers do to improve the condition of the world's impoverished? These are some of the questions this course is designed to address. This course is intended especially for future lawyers and policymakers who seek a deeper understanding of the developing world. After a brief overview that will familiarize students with the major concepts and empirical debates in poverty and development studies, we will examine a variety of 'causes' of poverty, from poor governance to lack of economic opportunity to the role of society. Since this course is just as much about what can be done, we shall also consider applied approaches to poverty alleviation. These types of interventions include political/legal reforms such as anti-corruption initiatives, 'rule of law' interventions, right to information programs, privatization, and community-driven development models; economic solutions such as cash transfers and microfinance; and technological approaches such as new methods for measuring policy impact and the application of new technologies for state identification and distribution programs. In addition to more typical scholarly readings, students will review poverty alleviation policy proposals and contracts made by various stakeholders (academics, NGOs, states, international bodies, etc.). Grading is based on participation, a presentation of research or a proposal, and, in consultation with the professor, a research paper. The research paper may be a group project (Section 01) graded MP/R/F or an individual in-depth research proposal either of which could be the basis for future field research (Section 02) graded H/P/R/F. Students approved for Section 01 or Section 02 may receive R credit. Automatic grading penalty waived for research paper. Cross-listed with \nLAW 5025.

These issues, and the insights gained are relevant for protected area conservation worldwide.nWe will use a case study approach to ask:n(1) What approach to protected area (PA) conservation has been taken in each case? Who are the key proponents and what are their main social and ecological objectives? n(2) How successful has the protected area been at achieving its conservation goals?n(3) What are the benefits of the PA to people and who receives them?n(4) What are the costs of the PA to people and who pays them?n(5) Where benefits are not commensurate to costs, what, if anything, is being done to address the imbalance? How well is it working?nn(6) Are there alternative conservation models that would make the interests of parks and local people more compatible, and reduce the tradeoffs between them? What is needed to operationalize these alternatives, and how do they incentivize conservation behavior among local residents?nnThe class emphasizes student contributions and presentations. Students are required to read one or two books a month over the summer, and to come to campus in the fall well-prepared to discuss each one, including co-leading the discussion of one of the readings.

This understanding does not involve disowning those ancestors who may have caused harm, but telling a fuller truth, committing to transform and transmute the trauma, standing in solidarity with those most impacted, and not letting wealth inequality, racial violence, or climate chaos be the final chapter of their story. This participatory, immersive course draws in insights derived from whiteness studies, liberation psychology, solidarity economics, and critical family history, and methodologies drawn from restorative justice,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmore \u00bb",

How does courage relate to other virtues such as integrity, loyalty, fortitude, and self-sacrifice? Is heroism compatible with fear, shame, and humiliation? How do heroes become what they are, what role do education and imitation play? Is courage a gendered virtue?

Implicit in Klein's argument is the assumption that we do understand human thinking, or at least how to recognize it, and that A.I. confronts us with something radically different masquerading as the familiar. But perhaps the world has long been populated by different kinds of thinkers. That appears to be the claim of a number of critics working on poetry, who posit that poems are their own kinds of thinking machines, with the ability to represent a speaker's thinking, to facilitate a reader's thinking, to formulate the structure of thinking, or even to think for themselves. In this course, we'll examine such claims by close reading poems from a range of writers while also engaging works of criticism that grapple with these questions from formalist, phenomenological, and phi\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmore \u00bb",

This course will explore the relationships that Gothic texts have to each other. What can Frankenstein, with its multiple narrators, show us about how narratives pass from person to person? How does the contemporary bestseller Mexican Gothic address the colonial histories beneath older Romantic and Victorian narratives? And why might one turn a ghost story by Henry James from the end of the 19th century into a 21st-century Netflix series? In all of these cases, the Gothic effects of \"haunted reading\" allow the past's hidden ghosts and monstrous meanings to emerge, visibly changed and seeking attention.

Some argue that the purpose of college is to train you for a career. Others claim that college is no longer necessary, that you can launch the next big startup and change the world without a degree. Peter Thiel offers students like you $100,000 to skip or stop out of college because knowledge that is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind. Why read Plato if you're a STEM major, after all? Why think about primate health if you're in the arts? In the face of such critiques, this class makes a case for an expansive education that trains your mind to engage with a variety of subjects and skills. The philosophy behind this model has traditionally been called liberal education (from the Latin word for freedom, libertas). Together we will explore the history, practice, and rationales for a liberal education by putting canonical texts in conversation with more recent works. We will consider the relevance of liberal education to all areas of study, from STEM to the arts, and its relations to future careers. And we will examine the central place that the idea of 'the good life' has historically enjoyed in theories of liberal education. You will be prompted to examine your own life, to question how and why you make decisions, and to argue for your views while respecting those of others. Maybe you will conclude that a liberal education is no longer relevant in the twenty-first century, but we hope that you will do so armed with a thorough understanding of what it has been and what it can be. In the end, college is less about what you will do in life, than about what kind of person you will be. So: what kind of person do you want to be? What kind of life will you live?

Pride parades and marriage rights have become emblems of a global movement that seems to transcend culture. This course asks what has allowed LGBTQ+ issues to become leading indicators of a certain kind of liberalization and modernization. What is the road LGBTQ+ rights took from the Stonewall Inn in 1969 to Pride Parades in Minsk, Kolkata and Nuuk, Greenland by 2015? This course will introduce students to the concepts and issues that have shaped this development. But it will also highlight the concepts by which historians, social scientists and political theorists have interrogated the problematic underbelly of this story of global triumph. What gets left out when we frame the course of LGBTQ+ history as somehow moving from Lower Manhattan to the rest of the world? Many academics studying LGBTQ+ history worry about the eurocentrism inherent in this way of telling the story this way, and about how it truncates our understanding of LGBTQ+ culture. After all, are LGBTQ+ identities and rights one size-fits-all? Do they become a way for Western nations to once again set the standards by which others are judged developmentally deficient? In certain societies reference to a 'traditional' national way of thinking about gender and sexuality is simply a fig leaf for homophobia and transphobia. But in other countries an international vocabulary of LGBTQ+ identity comes face-to-face with longstanding or newly emergent configurations of gender and sexuality that look very different. How do we mediate between those two? At the same time, the way Western societies export their conception of what LGBTQ+ identity is and why and when it matters tells us something about how Western Europe and the United States think about these issues themselves? What kinds of rights do Western nations tend to (or at least claim to) champion? Who gets to have and claim those rights?",

We consider how a range of factors, from religious norms to colonial laws have regulated how meat and animals fit into society often with unexpected results. For instance, attitudes to waste from animal slaughter led to the development of the abattoir, and ultimately facilitated industrialized meat production.

What have been South Korea's significant encounters with the figure of the Other in its modern history? How were women implicated in the changing landscape of colonial Korea, the Korean War, Korea's Vietnam War experience, and compressed modernization? How have the influx of migrant labor and North Korean refugees impacted ideas about race in South Korea? And finally, what does K-pop tell us about shifting South Korean views of race and gender?

Traditionally in Japan the distinction between a work of art and a utilitarian object was inessential. An aesthetic object acquired its cultural identity and social value precisely because it could be used. Famous examples of this duality can be found in tea ceremony ceramics, complex architectural joinery, lavish fabric design, and fine temple-inspired cuisine.

This course will focus on the confluence of these two communities by exploring the art of migration from the 20th century to today\u00bfincluding painting, sculpture, drawing, street art, photography and video--with a focus on works representing France, or produced in France or by French artists.Beyond aesthetic considerations, many of the artists who formed part of the successive generations of the legendary 20th century \"School of Paris\", and continue to enrich the Parisian art scene today, have also come fleeing various forms of persecution or turmoil in their home countries, from war to anti-Semitism to fascism to colonialism to terrorism. The ways that these \"cultural migrants\" have represented their journey and negotiated their multi-layered identities in their work, both then and now, will be explored. Current day migration in a post-colonial context will also be studied, as a means to discover the various strategies used by contemporary artists to humanize and give visibility to the struggle of the displaced, while addressing societal concerns fueling displacement today, including racial, social, religious and gender inequality, conflict, and climate change.Instructional format will include in-class lectures, discussions with contemporary artists, and above all, site visits to Parisian museums, neighborhoods and relevant socio-cultural institutions.

Why have scholars suggested \"that baseball may be perceived as a sort of mirror in which values, power, politics, fashion, class, economics, and race be viewed in microcosm,\" as Ronald Briley writes in \"Baseball and American Cultural Values\"? How has baseball become intertwined with American identity? What is it about the sport that immediately evokes nostalgia on a national level? What do baseball legends have in common with canonical literary heroes? Through our process of discovery, we'll \"pitch\" baseball as an objective correlative and use it to power our own fiction. In this workshop designed for both rookie and pro writers, the goals and objectives are: to become acquainted with a brief overview of baseball's history and rules in the nineteenth century and beyond; to learn and experiment with the craft elements of fiction: character, POV, plot, and place; to improve upon incorporating research, analysis, and American popular culture into creative work; to deliver and receive collegial feedback about creative work within a supportive community; to hit a baseball (seriously!) and attend a San Francisco Giants game.

The provision of security in Latin America has often been plagued by torture, excessive use of force, military deployments and police brutality. During the colonial era, political order was often imposed using the coercive force of the State to police settlement patterns, repress indigenous rebellions, and chase runaway enslaved peoples.

Hawaii also has passed legislation that aspires to 100% fossil-free transportation by 2040. Significant growth of behind-the-meter solar generation with storage has led to opportunities for the better use of these resources for maintaining grid reliability, while also increasing concerns related to grid stability and social equity. Because of these factors, there is a heightened interest nationally from federal agencies, particularly Energy and Defense. We will consider the availability and viability of solar, wind, and geothermal resources, while also considering the economic impact on Hawaii of large-scale importation of oil for generating electricity and transportation. We will consider emerging questions related to the reliability and the resiliency of the grids on different islands in the State. All of these issues will be considered in the technical, societal, cultural, natural resource, and political milieu which is the unique nature of Hawaii. We will spend the first week on campus learning about energy and its context in Hawaii, then travel to various field sites in Hawaii, including a wind farm, a utility-scale solar farm, an oil-fired power plant, a waste-to-energy facility, wave turbine, an oil refinery, a synthetic gas production facility, a biofueled thermal generator, a geothermal plant, and areas where natural resources are impacted by energy resource utilization.

We will pay particular attention to the myths and stereotypes that cinema and television have sustained as well as Latin America's history of colonization to examine the prevalence of anti-blackness, anti-indigeneity, and other forms of erasure and social exclusion. Sources include Disney's Saludos Amigos and Encanto, Pixar's Coco, and the telenovela Yo soy Betty la fea, among others. Taught in English. Students are welcome to complete work in Spanish.",

Whether of working-class upbringing, activist and political participants, Black bourgeoisie, or one who aspires to a particular lifestyle, African American clothing culture represents an instance of Black signifying (a spectrum of Black performance styles and expressive culture) that rewrites everyday sartorial practices to reimagine the Black subject.

Students will also develop key communication, relationship building, and collaboration skills. The course features recent research on holistic human development, neuroscience of performance, and integrative leadership. Its design is based on a training program utilized by thousands of leaders of larger established organizations, venture backed startups, NGO's, and government agencies. This integrative approach to leadership development can reduce stress and lead to emotional balance, mental clarity, and increased effectiveness in life pursuits.",

Increasingly, many AI experts across academia and industry believe there is an urgent need for both technical and societal progress across AI alignment, ethics, and governance to understand and mitigate risks from increasingly capable AI systems and ensure that their contributions benefit society as a whole. Intro to AI Safety explores these questions in lectures with targeted readings, weekly quizzes, and group discussions. We are looking at the capabilities and limitations of current and future AI systems to understand why it is hard to ensure the reliability of existing AI systems. We will cover ongoing research efforts that tackle these questions, ranging from studies in reinforcement learning and computer vision to natural language processing.

Should humans try to alter their physiology in order to inhabit other planets? Or might the ultimate purpose of human existence be to leave organic biology behind entirely? This course explores a range of competing contemporary claims concerning the nature and future of humanity. It begins by reviewing the efforts of mid-20th century cybernetics to reconceive human beings as \"complex information processing systems.\" It then traces how this redefinition has led to the development of several competing camps: an ecological wing that views human beings as complex systems that must achieve environmental homeostasis; a posthumanist wing that stresses the radical plasticity and adaptability of human organisms; and a transhumanist wing that seeks to unleash the potential of human information processes on a cosmic scale. Participants will have the opportunity to survey the scientific foundations of each position and debate their ethical and political implications.",

This tension is steeped in political choices constrained by industrial power dynamics and conditioned by inequality. To what extent do visions and incentives align across industry, government, and social movements? What would the choice to scale or descale entail in each case - and are they mutually exclusive?

As it turns out, intelligence is complicated to build, and while computers outperform humans in many ways, they also fail to replicate key features of human intelligence at least for now. We will take a conceptual, non-technical approach (think: reading essays, not writing code).

Some unintended outcomes are very surprising, and would have been hard to predict. Others seem completely logical in hindsight and leaves people wondering why they were not anticipated.

From cans of tuna to shrimp cocktail, the legality of how seafood is caught and processed is often uncertain. This policy lab confronts the global environmental and human rights challenges associated with the existing framework of international laws and policies. The research delves into international laws that apply to the high seas, illegal fishing, supply chains, forced labor and human rights abuses to locate leverage points and explore innovative solutions, including how new technologies might be developed and deployed. The research contributes to a work of The Friends of Ocean Action -- convened by the World Economic Forum -- a coalition of public sector, private sector, and civil society leaders who are committed to accelerating action for sustainability. Solutions require cooperation among nations, international seafood companies, and nonprofit organizations, and the containment of rogue actors. In this policy lab, students will work with two clients. On illegal fishing, the client is Global Fishing Watch. Created through a collaboration among Google and other partners, Global Fishing Watch is a pioneer in harnessing satellite technology to enable better management of fisheries. On forced labor, the client is the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation, which brings together tuna processors who comprise more than 70% of the global market for canned tuna and is committed to developing solutions to address forced labor on fishing vessels in the tuna sector and beyond. Through the Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions, students will also connect to a broad range of additional actors on these issues, including UN agencies, large seafood companies, and human rights and environmental NGOs. Students will produce policy briefs that will be published by the Center for Ocean Solutions. The practicum seeks law students, business students, and graduate and well-qualified undergraduates in such programs as earth systems, computer science, product design, public policy, sociology, and marine biology.

This suggests that philosophy is not a collection of theories, but an emotional attitude toward a certain way of being. A philosopher is a person who is emotionally committed to becoming wise. The maxim Know Thyself! is regarded a main guiding principle in the philosopher's search for wisdom. It points us back towards ourselves, and presents our own personality as a subject to be studied and examined critically. Many have argued that this is not optional for those who wish to live well: as Socrates put it, the unexamined life is not worth living! Over the next ten weeks, we'll ask what it means to lead an examined life. We'll start by considering the opposite attitude, of the unthinking person who no longer cares to know truth from falsehood. We'll then ask how knowing oneself may differ from knowing others. Is there anything only you can know about yourself? Are there special, introspective means of coming to know yourself?

Where and when possible, we will host a member of the creative team of some plays in our class for a live discussion. Assigned materials include works by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Amiri Baraka, Young Jean Lee, Ayad Akhtar, Susan Lori Parks, David Henry Hwang, Betty Shamieh, Jeremy O. Harris, and Christopher Demos Brown.n nThis class offers undergraduate students a discussion that does not center whiteness, but takes power, history, culture, philosophy, and hierarchy as core points of debate. In the first two weeks, we will establish the common terms of the discussion about stereotypes, representation, and historical claims, but then we will quickly move toward an advanced conversation about effective discourse and activism through art, performance, and cultural production. In this class, we assume that colonialism, slavery, white supremacy, and oppressive contemporary state apparatuses are real, undeniable, and manifest. Since our starting point is clear, our central question is not about recognizing or delineating the issues, but rather, it is a debate about how to identify the target of our criticism in order to counter oppression effectively and dismantle long-standing structures.n nNot all BIPOC communities are represented in this syllabus, as such claim of inclusion in a single quarter would be tokenistic and disingenuous. Instead, we will aspire to understand and negotiate some of the complexities related to race in several communities locally in the U.S. and beyond.",

The objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of \"what is Japanese architecture?\" Apart from the existing literature and the present-day knowledge on the field of Japanese architecture, the presence of architectural heritage in Japan and in Kyoto city in particular is also a valuable way to discover Japanese architecture \"on site\". The topic of this seminar is to understand the synchronicity of both contemporary and ancient architecture in the XXIst century, and the importance of beingimmersed in this human-made heritage. The formation and the production of Japanese modern architecture is the result of a historical process, and interpretations of the past, which have adapted to the contemporary milieu, and physical, social and mental possibilities. Thus, this seminar will alternate a theoretical approach, through on-class seminar presentations, and \"fieldwork\", as active on-site visits of architectural works. KCJS course #EAAS 3993 OC 7",

While professional historians have long-established methodologies for writing about the past, history is continuously explored by people removed from the academy and uninterested in engaging with many of the historiographical and methodological issues that concern scholars. Put another way, many people think about, relate to, and recreate the past in ways that lack footnotes, citations, and sometimes even words. The course has two main components.

Everything changed very late in the 19th century and throughout 20th century, with the development of increasingly powerful medical imaging tools such as X-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and ultrasound. Today, X-rays can depict tiny bone cracks, ultrasound can visualize heart valve dysfunction, CT can map our vascular system, MRI can see small brain defects, and PET imaging can help identify aggressive cancers. In this seminar, we will discuss the magic of medical imaging and the principles and technologies behind these tools that enable seeing inside our body. We will discuss the main medical imaging modalities, and discuss their applications with real life examples. Students will learn about medical imaging as well as about common conditions and diseases, and aspects of human anatomy. Essential components of the seminar include active participation during the discussions and student-led presentations on medical imaging topics of interest.

According to this understanding, classical music follows baroque music and is superseded by romantic music; it develops a style, the classical style, as perfected by Haydn and Mozart. For others classical music has broader significance, referring to a cultural practice that predates the eighteenth century, going as far back as Gregorian chant and extending through the present. There are a variety of factors that define that practice, some more enduring than others: transmission through musical notation, theories of tonal systems, techniques of composition. Formal analysis, though often considered a sub-discipline of music theory and hence purely descriptive and objective, is hardly value free.

Historically, for artist and critic both, these questions had been the subject of philosophical debates about Beauty, Truth, and Genius. But in Proust's time, following the rupture introduced by Flaubert half a century earlier, they also became questions about society: Who gets to say what is art and what is not? Whose art is political and whose is 'for its own sake'? Does any art transcend context, or is 'art' always socially constructed? And what kinds of social connections does one need to have to be recognized as an artist? This course explores the growing field of sociological literary criticism, which sees the world of literature not as an abstract space of universal values, but as a kind of social game. Focusing on the novel, and how it operates as a sociological study in miniature, we'll also consider how novels themselves exist as objects or commoditie\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmore \u00bb",

Revisiting plays from the so-called `Golden Age' of English theater, we will approach works by Shakespeare and his early modern contemporaries not so much as `masterpieces' in the literary canon, but as for-profit entertainment enabled and shaped by legal, social, and political contexts. To gain comparative insight, and to expose both similarities and differences between entertainment's various functions over time, case studies in Elizabethan and Jacobean literature will be paired alongside excursions in contemporary media - from Pixar Studios' Inside Out to Ufotable's anime adaptation of the Gen Urobuchi light novel, Fate/Zero.

In this course, we will study the history of the sonnet in English: its beginnings in the Renaissance, its evolution in the seventeenth century, its Romantic revival, its modern adaptations, and its contemporary proliferation. Exploring the form's remarkable adaptability, we will read sonnets about love, about loss, about spiritual longing, and about social critique. We will look at sonnets about sonnets, sonnets against sonnets, sonnets that pretend they are not sonnets, and sonnets that engage with other forms. Over the quarter, as we trace the sonnet's many transformations, we will explore how its formal and rhetorical traits align (or misalign) with particular ways of thinking and feeling.

Two common answers are education and travel - and they are often combined into one, whether in the rite of 'going away to college,' the promotion of study abroad programs, or the advertising of tourism as a means to self-fulfillment. Education is understood as a journey; travel is framed as educational. In this course we'll explore the history and the implications - at once social and literary - of this travel-education equation, from the rise of the 'Grand Tour' in 17th- and 18th-century Europe to globetrotting travel blogs of the present. Drawing in diverse perspectives and authors, from Laurence Sterne and Charlotte Bront\u00eb to Tayeb Salih, we'll explore the historical relationship between two genres: travel writing and the novel of education (Bildungsroman). We will also pay special attention to how (post)colonialism, gender, race, and class both shape and haunt the travel-education paradigm for travelers, students, writers, and readers. The goal of the course is not only to learn about this literary and cultural history, along with building the writing skills to discuss it; it is also to gain perspective on our own historical positions within educational systems.

Latinx spiritual practices such as espiritismo, Santeria, curanderismo, among others, will become avenues through which will explore key themes in Black/Latina/Chicana feminisms, including the politics of representation, stigmatization, multiple forms of state and interpersonal violence, intersecting forms of oppression, economic justice, reproductive justice, queerness/sexuality/lesbianism, and strategies of empowerment and resistance.

In Jordan, the Eastern civilizations of Ammon, Moab, Canaan, Assyria, and Babylon thrived as did the Romans and the Persians.

The proposed course takes cultural artifacts as the foundational blocks of the Levant, asking a fundamental question about how a contemporary state exists on top and beside the ancient past, by exploring three cities: Petra, Jerash, and Amman. All three cities have large Amphitheatres that suggest a particular pattern of growth over time, and play a major role in how these cities function today as tourist attractions and geography for performances of everyday life. In these three case studies, students will investigate how theatre and performance, along with culture in its broadest definition, have shaped the destiny of the Levant historically and the present-day Hashemite Kingdom. We will ask: How did three major metropolitan cities that stretch back to antiquity develop into very different urban living spaces today? Why do all of them have a massive theatrical space in their midst? What conclusions can be drawn from the stunted development of Petra, the semi-developed city of Jerash, and the highly developed capital city, Amman, based on the position and the level of activity in their theatrical spaces over time?",

This Introductory Seminar addresses the critical problem of the marginalization of black female authors within established canons of modern African literature. We will explore, analyse and interrogate the reasons why, and the ways in which, women-authored bodies of work from this period continue to be lost, misplaced, forgotten, and ignored by a male-dominated and largely European/white publishing industry in the context of colonialism, apartheid and globalization. nnYou will be introduced to key twentieth-century and more contemporary female authors from Africa, some of them published but many more unpublished or out-of-print. The class will look at the challenges these female authors faced in publishing, including how they navigated a hostile publishing industry and a lack of funding and intellectual support for black writers, especially female writers. nnWe will also examine the strategies these writers used to mitigate their apparent marginality, including looking at how women self-published, how they used newspapers as publication venues, how they have increasingly turned to digital platforms, and how many sought international publishing networks outside of the African continent. As one of the primary assessments for the seminar, you will be asked to conceptualize and design an in-depth and imaginative pitch for a new publishing platform that specializes in African female authors. nnYou will also have the opportunity for in-depth engagement (both in class and in one-on-one mentor sessions) with a range of leading pioneers in the field of publishing and literature in Africa. Figures like Ainehi Edoro (founder of Brittle Paper) and Zukiswa Wanner (prize-winning author of The Madams and Men of the South), amongst others, will be guests to our Zoom classroom. One of our industry specialists will meet with you to offer detailed feedback on your proposal for your imagined publishing platform. nnYou can expect a roughly 50/50 division between synchronous and asynchronous learning, as well as plenty of opportunity to collaborate with peers in smaller settings.",

We will approach this question through the lens of social choice theory, and connect this theory from economics and political science to the potential design of algorithms that aggregate our diverse preferences and information. We will review various systems of preference and information aggregation in small groups as well as large societies, including voting systems, bargaining protocols, and methods of deliberation. We will also describe decision making problems that arise in modern applications, such as distributed systems like blockchains and Wikipedia, as well as applications of topical interest such as the assignment of children to schools, the design of congressional districts, and the direct involvement of communities in participatory budgeting. nnA key objective of the class will be to get students to think about how social choice theory can be applied to real-life problems through the design of algorithms.

        "course_description": "The legal services market is in the middle of its most dramatic reexamination in decades. Several states --- among them California, Arizona, Utah, and Florida --- are considering or already implementing changes to their Rules of Professional Conduct in order to expand who can provide legal services and how. These reforms are designed to accelerate innovation in the delivery of legal services and, ultimately, increase access to justice, in part by allowing technology and people without JDs to play a greater role than they can today. As states consider these reforms, questions have come to the fore as to how potential changes may impact potential clients, existing clients, and providers of legal services. Significant questions include: Who are the nontraditional legal services providers most likely to seek to operate under the new rules? What are their delivery and business models? What kinds of consumers are they serving, and for what kinds of legal needs? What risks do they pose? With Utah and Arizona's reforms in place and new services providers entering those systems, we can start to answer these vital questions. Students will interview entrepreneurs, lawyers, and consumers to map the current and future provider landscape and will draft a report that offers guidance to the judges and policymakers who are shaping the future of access to justice. Likely clients for the lab include the Utah Supreme Court's Office of Legal Services Innovation and the Arizona Supreme Court. The lab's work will also inform the work of the State Bar of California's Closing the Justice Gap Working Group, on which two of the instructors serve as public appointed members. Students will emerge from the practicum with a richer understanding of the access to justice crisis in the United States and the range of legal, policy, and entrepreneurial interventions and opportunities that might address it. Students from a range of disciplines are welcome, including undergraduates interested in public policy. This is a one-quarter practicum. There may be a related practicum offered during spring quarter, but students do not need to commit to two quarters. Law students wishing to take the class for R credit will perform additional research or take on additional tasks.

It then considers how the Athenians (shell-shocked from war and three outbreaks of plague) and the rest of 4th century Greece rebuild their lives and the monuments that define them. Earlier 5th century traditions endure, with subtle changes, in the work of sculptors such as Kephisodotos. Less subtle are the outlook and output of his son Praxiteles. In collaboration with Phryne, his muse and mistress, Praxiteles challenged the canons and constraints of the past with the first female nude in the history of Greek sculpture. His gender-bending gods and men were equally audacious, their shiny surfaces reflecting Plato's discussion of Eros and androgyny. Scopas was also a man of his time, but pursued different interests. Drawn to the interior lives of men and woman, his tormented Trojan War heroes and victims are still scarred by memories of the Peloponnesian War, and a world away from the serene faces of the Parthenon. His Maenad, who has left this world for another, belongs to the same years as Euripides' Bacchae and, at the same time, anticipates the torsion and turbulence of Bernini and the Italian Baroque. The history and visual culture of these years remind us that we are not alone, that the Greeks grappled as we do with the inevitability and consequences of war, disease and inner daemons.",

Although some of Trump\u00bfs actions have seemed anomalous, they have all relied on and reaffirmed longstanding legacies of settler colonialism and racial capitalism. In this seminar, we will look at these legacies through the eyes of the Natives, Latinxs, whites, and others who have lived in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. Within the confines of literature, we will read novelists like Willa Cather, essayists like Valeria Luiselli, and poets like Simon Ortiz (Acoma Pueblo). Meanwhile, across the more capacious category of culture, we will engage with promoters who encouraged whites to claim homesteads, periodistas who emboldened Latinxs to protect pueblos, and leaders who helped Natives fight for sovereignty. By blending literary studies and ethnic studies, we will gain a thorough grasp of the territories that have taken shape since the U.S.-Mexico War (1846\u00bf48), especially the ones that we currently call Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas. From these concrete contexts, we will ask and answer more abstract questions: What are borders\u00bfare they physical boundaries, or are they psychosocial conditions? Similarly, what are nations\u00bfare they stable and homogeneous groups, or are they flexible and diverse communities? Ultimately, what are human beings\u00bfcan they be branded as illegal aliens, or do they have inalienable rights? During the quarter, we will work through these questions both collectively and individually: to enrich our in-class discussions, each five-unit student will complete a four- to five-page reading of a single source, a six- to eight-page paper on several sources, and a multimedia borderlands map.",

The callousness with which the murder was carried out, the calm refusal of the policeman kneeling on Floyd's neck to heed the horrified objections of witnesses at the scene, and an in-the-bones familiarity for too many of us across the country regarding disproportionate police violence against people of color was finally too much to bear. Only the last in a long list of maiming and murders by state authorities of men, women, and children from racialized communities (African American, Latinx, and Native) across the country, Floyd's murder precipitated an anguished outcry for justice by feeling people of all races across the world. Floyd was not the first, and unfortunately, he is not the last, to be so abused. The difference now is that many more of us understand that we have to stand up and demand an end to the injustice. nAmid calls to urgent action in support of racial and gender justice, this reading group/course considers literatures in English specifically through the lens of Reading and Teaching for Justice. The goal of this course is to train readers to attend to the perspectives of those whose lives are often denied, dismissed, disregarded, even as we attend to how and why works of literature that exclude such voices who hail from a variety of equity-seeking groups, both within and without the literary texts selected. Reading for Justice requests that as readers we engage deeply with what justice means for us today, and what it has meant historically.",

An author dies, or loses interest, or flouts convention: whatever the cause, unfinished novels demand an especially dynamic relationship between reader and text, precipitating either wild flights of imagination or scrupulous detective work, if not both at once. In the nineteenth century, a period obsessed with all things comprehensive and complete, such fragmentariness would have appeared still more challenging, even subversive. Closely reading works by Jane Austen, Edgar Allan Poe, and Charles Dickens, along with select critical interpretations, this course will invite participants to ask: what do unfinished novels reveal to us that finished ones cannot? What peculiar insights do they give us into the processes and pressures of literary production? And what exactly is our role in consuming them?nNote: This Writing-Intensive Seminar in English (WISE) course fulfills WIM for English majors. Non-majors are welcome, space permitting.

Rising rates of clinical depression and other conditions have rendered mental health a pressing cultural concern, especially for young adults, leading institutions of higher education to expand resources to support student needs. But we have not always thought about mental health the ways we do today. In this course we read landmark literary texts from midcentury to present that both reflect and shape cultural constructions of mental health. From Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye (1970) to Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation (1994)to Ottessa Moshfegh's My Year of Rest and Relaxation (2018), we examine how literature destabilizes would-be binaries between mental health and mental illness. How do intersectional identity factors such as gender, race, and class inform whose mental illness is deemed deserving of treatment and whose is instead criminalized? Honing our critical writing skills by learning to employ the tools of cultural criticism, feminist theory, and critical race studies, we also engage selections from Doris Lessing, Anne Sexton, Sylvia Plath, Ralph Ellison, Richard Wright, Esm\u00e9 Weijun Wang, and others.

But to see ourselves as good readers is implicitly(perhaps even complicitly)to set ourselves against another form of literary consumption: bad reading, and, by association, bad readers. Yet what makes reading \"bad\" or \"good\"? And who decides? The more we look, the less self-evident or definitive the distinction becomes,our footing precipitously dropping away into questions about our own reading practices and how society values them. The precarious label \"bad reading\" comes into even sharper relief when we consider that the term has long been associated not just with certain modes of reading, but also with certain classes of readers and certain kinds of books, from gory gothic thrillers and racy romances to sci-fi and comics. In this course, we will trace the definitions and stakes of bad reading from the nineteenth century to the present day, through sources ranging from Jane Austen and Virginia Woolf to contemporary think-pieces on young adult literature and race in publishing. Along the way, we will aim both to discover whether bad reading is really so bad after all, and to understand how ideologies of gender, class, and race have shaped our conceptions of literary value.nNote: This Writing-Intensive Seminar in English (WISE) course fulfills WIM for English majors.

This class will give students an opportunity to delve deeply into the histories, causes, and cultures involved in religious conflict. We will also challenge the assumption that different religions or particular religions are prone to conflict or tend towards violence. By studying resolutions to conflicts and looking at cases of inter-religious dialogue and cooperation, students will be able to counter stereotypes and move beyond the rhetoric surrounding religion and conflict. The course will be both theoretical and practical. We will study how religious conflicts have been addressed academically and in policy discussions. We will also explore how religious beliefs, institutions, and actors have exacerbated or mitigated conflicts and facilitated or thwarted their resolutions. To illustrate these theories each section is accompanied by an examination of particular case studies of religious conflicts, some resolved and others ongoing, and efforts at religious peacebuilding, some successful and others not.

In this course we will engage with claims about identity, culture, and politics that some might say come from the \"Middle East\" but that we understand as global. Ganzeer's graphic novel is as much for California as it is for Egypt. Ataturk's speech is about power and identity just like Donald Trump is about power and identity. In Turkish novels and in Arabic poetry, the people we engage in this course look to their pasts and our futures. What happens next? This is the third of three courses in the Middle Eastern track. These courses offer an unparalleled opportunity to study Middle Eastern history and culture, past and present.

How then can we begin to make sense of it? In this course, we will examine the first-hand experience of psychosis. We will approach it from multiple perspectives, including clinical descriptions, works of art, and texts by writers ranging from Shakespeare, to the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, to patients attempting to describe their experience.

The class will look at the challenges these female authors faced in publishing, including how they navigated a hostile publishing industry and a lack of funding and intellectual support for black writers, especially female writers. nnWe will also examine the strategies these writers used to mitigate their apparent marginality, including looking at how women self-published, how they used newspapers as publication venues, how they have increasingly turned to digital platforms, and how many sought international publishing networks outside of the African continent. As one of the primary assessments for the seminar, you will be asked to conceptualize and design an in-depth and imaginative pitch for a new publishing platform that specializes in African female authors. nnYou will also have the opportunity for in-depth engagement (both in class and in one-on-one mentor sessions) with a range of leading pioneers in the field of publishing and literature in Africa. Figures like Ainehi Edoro (founder of Brittle Paper) and Zukiswa Wanner (prize-winning author of The Madams and Men of the South), amongst others, will be guests to our Zoom classroom.

As Angela Davis argues in Are Prisons Obsolete, \"The prison is considered so 'natural' that it is extremely hard to imagine life without it.\" This is what makes the United States a carceral society. In this service learning course we will take on the monumental and timely task of developing that abolitionist imaginary. We will not be making this journey alone, but will draw on the visions of activists, academics, and currently/formerly incarcerated scholars and artists to guide us. The course has two community partner organizations. With our first community partner, the Ella Baker Center, we will participate in the Prison Mail Night, where we will learn about the real situations of currently incarcerated people and contribute to the procedural abolitionist task of helping people decarcerate themselves. With our second community partner, the Ahimsa Collective, will run weekly transformative justice circles for us to process the contents of the class and to learn a key process in the abolitionist toolkit. Alongside the service learning elements the syllabus is structured in three parts. In the first two weeks we will reflect on the deep history and global geography of the abolitionist struggle, as we can't know where we're going unless we know where we've come from. The middle five weeks will be a whistle-stop tour of current abolitionist struggles, from Abolish ICE to decriminalizing sex work, viewing the broader question of an abolitionist future from the unique issues foregrounded in each struggle. The final three weeks will be dedicated to developing final class projects, which will take the form of speculative artworks which explore the possible future of one abolitionist struggle. This class will be entirely virtual.nnCardinal Course certified by the Haas Center",
