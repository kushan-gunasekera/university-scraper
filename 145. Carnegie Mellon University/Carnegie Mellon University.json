The string quartet repertoire under discussion spans the first attempts at string quartet writing in the 17th Century, to serialism and microtonal disintegration in the 1960s, to contemporary Pop-Rock fusion experiments. This course also deals with the social and personal histories of four individuals who freed themselves from hegemonic orchestral rules in favor of an instrumental democratic microcosm.

Special focus on the production (and reception) of sound by artists, amplifying those creative efforts that, in having explored acoustics, soundscapes, and listening, might also serve to inspire students to incorporate sound in their own work. Contemporary critical theory, by and large, is still glaringly silent on aurality and auditory phenomena; it seriously fails to consider sound as an object of study, instead focusing quite exclusively on visual culture (film, TV, video, computer screens, which are, of course, technologies of vision and sound). This seminar will address this roaring silence by examining some suggestive but disparate theoretical work related to sound and by engaging with a range of artistic practices that explore the production and reception of sound itself."

While such expectations exist, practice in this genre of writing, particularly in the personal statement, is not always readily available in existing coursework. \"Presenting a Public Self\" will introduce methods for developing and practicing your ability to communicate individual proficiencies and aspirations in written form, while bringing you in contact with a body of published work by public intellectual figures from the U.S. and other territories whose writing demonstrates an intertwining of personal narrative and public, professional identity, to engage readers of all stripes.   Throughout the term you will practice writing in the public yet personal vein through assignments like: self-portrait essay, to cultivate a first-person voice, an op-ed essay, to practice balance in argument from the position of a burgeoning expert in your disciplinary area, and a personal statement, where you will learn to combine articulation of a personal narrative and professional competency to argue why you are a strong candidate for a particular opportunity. Reading selections for the semester will include work produced by your peers, as well as published writers whose work combines personal and professional spheres, ranging from texts like Paul John Eakin's Living Autobiographically to Mary Catherine Bateson's Composing a Life to Spencer Nadler's The Language of Cells: A Doctor and his Patients, amongst others."

In a time when many forms of communication are digitally based, traveling as bits at e-speeds on global computer networks? To begin answering these questions, we will take as case studies several new discursive digital media formations, such as digital books, on-line newspapers, blogs, wikis, and so forth, along with related social formations, such as social media and distributed non-profit activist organizations. The readings will provide a range of lens by which to understand these developments, including cognitive, social, political, economic and technological aspects. We will briefly put the development of communication technologies in their historical context: How were new forms of communication received in the past? How were they used? How did they affect communication? How did they influence political and social institutions? We will focus, however, on using knowledge of historical developments to inform our understandings of current digital communication developments.  Along the way we will ask questions, such as \"What are some of the challenges that new digital formations present to traditional communication theories (e.g., What does authorship look like in massively open online collaborations when the boundaries between reading and authoring are blurred? How is trust established when speakers are anonymous and globally distributed? How are identities discursively constructed?

To gain insight into the why behind the surprising things readers do with a text, we will draw on the psychology of reading, where socially constructed memory networks, cognitive schemas, and meta-knowledge actively shape interpretation. User-testing to discover the representations readers are in fact creating can be critical for many kinds of writing, from informative websites, to persuasive arguments, or engaging accounts. Turning then to writers, we will examine the key processes, from interpreting the task, to planning, revision and meta cognitive awareness on which expert and novice writers differ.  You will also learn a set of process tracing methods for tracking these problem-solving strategies as you do two case studies. One will uncover the (sometimes radical) differences in how a set of readers actually interpret (construct the meaning of) a text you choose. The second will be an extended case study of your own thinking process on a real task you are doing outside this class.  Here you are likely to uncover old unconscious habits and problems you had to solve, as well as successful strategies, which will give you new reflective insight into your own thinking as a writer."

As a published author, foreign correspondent and Pulitzer-Prize winning editor, the instructor has been a foot soldier in print journalism and media management for 30 years. The practical emphasis of the course reflects his extensive and varied background. The course focuses on the four stages necessary to any nonfiction story: idea, concept, reporting and writing. Subjects include how to make news judgments, gather evidence, make word choices, compose stories and interpret events, unpacking the language and vocabulary of the craft of journalism. As part of our exploration of advanced nonfiction styles, we examine the six major genres of journalistic nonfiction: the trend story, the profile, the explanatory, the narrative, the point-of-view and the investigative. We will read, critique, discuss and analyze examples of each genre, and students will produce work of their own in four of the genres. Students may substitute (for one of the four writing genres) independent research on a topic of their choosing. In addition, we explore journalism's glorious past and its role in the promotion and maintenance of democracy. The last segment of the course examines the evolution of journalism in the digital age and the impact that is having on the media landscape, particularly print. Students will be given assistance and encouragement as they seek outlets for their writings and connections in the media world that could lead to internships and employment."

Since the first draft of a human genome sequence became available at the start of this century, the cost of genome sequencing has decreased dramatically. Personal genome sequencing will likely become a routine part of medical exams for patients for prognostic and diagnostic purposes. Personal genome information will also play an increasing role in lifestyle choices, as people take into account their own genetic tendencies. Commercial services such as 23andMe have already taken first steps in this direction. Computational methods for mining large-scale genome data are being developed to unravel the genetic basis of diseases and assist doctors in clinics. This course introduces students to biological, computational, and ethical issues concerning use of personal genome information in health maintenance, medical practice, biomedical research, and policymaking. We focus on practical issues, using individual genome sequences (such as that of Nobel prize winner James Watson) and other population-level genome data. Without requiring any background in biology or CS, we begin with an overview of topics from genetics, molecular biology, stats, and machine learning relevant to the modern personal genome era. We then cover scientific issues such as how to discover your genetic ancestry and how to learn from genomes about migration and evolution of human populations. We discuss medical aspects such as how to predict whether you will develop diseases such as diabetes based on your own genome, how to discover disease-causing genetic mutations, and how genetic information can be used to recommend clinical treatments."

They also will learn the nomenclature used in molecular biology. In turn, biologists will obtain (a glimpse of) what quantitative tools can achieve beyond the mere collecting and archiving of facts in a universe of observations: By devising models, non-obvious quantitative predictions are derived which can be experimentally tested and may lead to threads that connect vastly different, apparently unrelated phenomena. One major goal is then to merge the two areas, physics and biology, in a unified perspective."

Examples are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measures of consumers' implicit attitudes.     The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting.  The questions to be considered include:  What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable?  What is the pathway from laboratory to practice?  What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice?     The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students.  They should bring to the course an interest in application; extensive prior experience in cognitive science is not necessary.  The course will include tutorials on basic topics in cognitive science such as perception, memory, and spatial cognition.  These should provide sufficient grounding to discuss the applications."

How can we make sure online learning is maximally effective? Learners differ along many dimensions and they change over time. Therefore, advanced learning technologies must adapt to learners to provide individualized learning experiences.  This course covers a number of proven personalization techniques used in advanced learning technologies. One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.  The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches. Students will learn to use the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT, <a href=\"http://ctat.pact.cs.cmu.edu\">http://ctat.pact.cs.cmu.edu</a>;) to implement tutor prototypes that rely on computer-executable models of human problem solving to personalize instruction.

        "course_description": "Large datasets are difficult to work with for several reasons. They are difficult to visualize, and it is difficult to understand what sort of errors and biases are present in them. They are computationally expensive to process, and often the cost of learning is hard to predict - for instance, and algorithm that runs quickly in a dataset that fits in memory may be exorbitantly expensive when the dataset is too large for memory. Large datasets may also display qualitatively different behavior in terms of which learning methods produce the most accurate predictions.  This course is intended to provide a student practical knowledge of, and experience with, the issues involving large datasets. Among the issues considered are: scalable learning techniques, such as streaming machine learning techniques; parallel infrastructures such as map-reduce; practical techniques for reducing the memory requirements for learning methods, such as feature hashing and Bloom filters; and techniques for analysis of programs in terms of memory, disk usage, and (for parallel methods) communication complexity.  The class will include programming assignments, and a one-month short project chosen by the student. The project will be designed to compare the scalability of variant learning algorithms on datasets.  An introductory course in machine learning, like 10-601 or 10-701, is a prerequisite or a co-requisite. If you plan to take this course and 10-601 concurrently please tell the instructor.  The course will include several substantial programming assignments, so an additional prerequisite is 15-211, or 15-214, or comparable familiarity with Java and good programming skills."

We will present you with several well-defined open problems and provide you with recently collected datasets that can get you started immediately! But you will be free to define your own problem using that data as well, or come up with your own problem entirely. There are no other constraints, and since this is a new area of research, you can (and should) be creative and as crazy in coming up with methods to tackle them.

Basic knowledge of NNs, known currently in the popular literature as \"deep learning\", familiarity with various formalisms, and knowledge of tools, is now an essential requirement for any researcher or developer in most AI and NLP fields. This course is a broad introduction to the field of neural networks and their \"deep\" learning formalisms. The course traces some of the development of neural network theory and design through time, leading quickly to a discussion of various network formalisms, including simple feedforward, convolutional, recurrent, and probabilistic formalisms, the rationale behind their development, and challenges behind learning such networks and various proposed solutions. We subsequently cover various extensions and models that enable their application to various tasks such as computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation and playing games. Instruction Unlike prior editions of 11-785, the instruction will primarily be through instructor lectures, and the occasional guest lecture. Evaluation Students will be evaluated based on weekly continuous-evaluation tests, and their performance in assignments and a final course project. There will be six hands-on assignments, requiring both low-level coding and toolkit-based implementation of neural networks, covering basic MLP, convolutional and recurrent formalisms, as well as one or more advanced tasks, in addition to the final project."

But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

The  course introduces the foundational concepts and fundamental techniques  of the most prominent and successful approaches to programming language  semantics that have been developed. Broadly speaking, semantics is  concerned with the provision of mathematical meanings to programs, at an  appropriate level of abstraction, to allow formalization of program  behavior and facilitate proofs of correctness. Our aim is to demonstrate  the utility of a scientific approach to programming and languages. We  focus on the most important and most general frameworks for semantic  description: denotational and operational semantics. These frameworks  are widely applicable and offer complementary approaches to language  definition, with various advantages. We also discuss formal  specifications, and logics of program correctness. We make extensive use  of mathematical and structural induction, and computational induction.  We use semantics to describe program behavior, guide the development of  correct programs, specify and prove the correctness of a compiler,  validate program logics, and derive laws of program equivalence. We  discuss imperative and functional languages, sequential and parallel,  high-level and low-level, as time permits."

As we enter an age where companies like Uber are testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh and innovative interfaces like IBMs Watson can play jeopardy and learn techniques for medical diagnoses, how are we to negotiate an intelligence explosion that for many individuals might threaten the very notions of what it means to be human?  The future of human-to-machine relationships will likely define our historical epoch and yet, many young technologists and humanists underestimate the downstream impact of technological innovations on human society.  Presently, we have little choice but to attend to this rapidly anxiety-ridden question.  This seminar will attend to the challenge of present existential questions on what it means to be human (read not machine) in the context of a rapidly advancing technological age.  We will consider human narratives throughout history that exam how governments and individual citizens defined humanity in the context of slavery and colonialism as a framework for exploring and projecting what it means to be human in the age of rapidly advancing intelligent machines.  We will trace the technological advancements of the recent five decades and identify historical precedents and speculative narratives that help us to consider issues like labor, economic disparity, negotiations of power, human dignity and ethical responsibility within the context of human relations with advancing technological tools that are now coined, artificial intelligence."

Specific topics include  configuration spaces, manifolds, groups, Lie groups,   representations of velocity,   holonomic and nonholonomic constraints,   constraint curvature, response to cyclic inputs and  distance metrics. The primary goal of this class is to develop an intuitive understanding of these concepts and how they are used in locomoting systems, rather than working through a set of formal proofs and derivations. We do, however, incorporate enough mathematical formalism for this class to serve as a starting point for further investigation into this topic area. We also call upon biological data, when available, and relate to the mathematical formalisms in the class."

In fact, many conventional approaches to motion planning and robot control attempt to explicitly cancel out the dynamics associated with different tasks. This class will consider underactuated robots, systems that do not have full control over their state and therefore cannot be planned for or controlled via conventional methods. Our goal will be to make novel locomoting robots act more \"naturally.\" This class will highlight the relationship between conventional ideas from deterministic motion planning and control design (e.g., dynamic programming and linear-quadratic regulators) and their contemporary counterparts, many of which help form the analytical basis for the probabilisitic reasoning that underlies contemporary AI systems (e.g., POMDPs). Note that this course is inspired by and, for the most part, will follow the format of \"Underactuated Robotics: Learning, Planning, and Control for Efficient and Agile Machines\" created by Prof. Russ Tedrake at MIT. We will take several tangents, but the course materials provided by Prof. Tedrake through MIT Open Courseware are an incredible resource for this course (and really just in general)."

Its purpose is to enable software engineers to be more effective in domains where software and hardware are closely coupled. Examples of such domains include robotics, avionics, automotive, process control, and many others. Students successfully completing this course will be better prepared to communicate with hardware-oriented engineers, understand the hardware environment, and the subtle regions where software and hardware meet.   Requirement: Students need not have a hardware background, but they should have a solid computer science background including languages, data structures, discrete math, operating systems, and computer organization.  It is highly desirable that students have project experience, preferably real-world experience, although project course work and/or internships will suffice. Undergraduates need instructor approval (lattanze@cs.cmu.edu)."

        "course_description": "Internet services companies such as Google, Yahoo!, Amazon, and Facebook have pioneered systems that have achieved unprecedented scale while still providing high level availability and a high cost-performance.  These systems differ from mainstream high performance systems in fundamental ways.  They are data intensive rather than compute intensive as we see with mainstream super computers spending the bulk of their time performing data I/O and manipulation rather than computation.  They need to inherently support scalability, typically having high reliability and availability demands as well.  Given that they often operate in the commercial space the cost-performance of these systems needs to be such that the organizations dependent on such systems can turn a profit. Designing and building these systems require a specialized set of skills. This course will cover the set of topics needed in order to design and build data intensive scalable systems.  In this domain engineers not only need to know how to architect systems that are inherently scalable, but to do so in a way that also supports high availability, reliability, and performance.   Given the large distributed nature of these systems basic distributed systems concepts such as consistency and time and synchronization are also important.  These systems largely operate around the clock, placing an emphasis on operational concerns.  This course will introduce students to these concerns with the intent that they understand the extent to which things like deploying, monitoring, and upgrading impact the design. The course will be a hands-on project oriented course.  The basic concepts will be given during the lectures and applied in the project.  The students will gain exposure to the core concepts needed to design and build such systems as well as current technologies in this space.  Class size will be limited."

From there, we move to more complex adders (carry-look-ahead, carry-skip, carry-bypass, etc.), multipliers, dividers, and floating-point units. For each circuit introduced, we will develop techniques and present theory for evaluating their functionality and speed. Other methods will be described for analyzing a circuit's power consumption, testability, silicon area requirements, correctness, and cost. In addition, we will utilize various CAD tools to evaluate the circuits described. Finally, advanced timing and clocking concepts will be investigated. For example, the notion of clock skew will be introduced and its impact on clock period for sequential circuits will be analyzed. We will also learn how to analyze and design asynchronous circuits, a class of sequential circuits that do not utilize a clock signal.  Course projects have been completely re-designed. Now projects focus on key arithmetic aspects of various machine learning algorithms including: K-nearest neighbors, neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines."

Entrepreneurs and innovators interested in commercializing technology in the biomedical, energy, transportation, information technology, robotics, aerospace, food, healthcare, and other industries require more than knowing whether a technology works and the potential market. Non-market factors such as regulations, standards, and grants influence product, price, location, research, development, and testing, and other decisions. As a result, public policies provide both opportunities and challenges for the commercialization of an invention. Only by recognizing these opportunities or overcoming these challenges can an invention become a commercialized innovation."

Since metal powders are a key input, powder-making methods will be discussed. Components once printed must satisfy various property requirements hence microstructure-property relationships will be discussed because the microstructures that emerge from the inherently high cooling rates differ strongly from conventional materials. Defect structures are important to performance and therefore inspection. Porosity is a particularly important feature of 3D printed metals and its occurrence depends strongly on the input materials and on the processing conditions.

It should be of interest to anyone wishing to see the  way statistical ideas play out within the brain sciences, and it  will provide a series of case studies on the role of stochastic  models in scientific investigation.  Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built  with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are  usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of  spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson  neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation  into frequency-based components.  In the visual system, V1 simple  cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in  the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and  CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized  using dynamic place models.  It has also been proposed that  perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian)  combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and  some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain  pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers.  Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise'' components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis. In neuroscience, however, the models also help form a conceptual framework for understanding neural function.  This course will examine some of the most important methods and  claims that have come from applying statistical thinking"

Its downfall was related to deregulation of California's energy commodity trading and a series of rolling power blackouts over months.  For example, Enron traders encouraged the removal of power during the energy crisis by suggesting plant shutdowns.  The resulting increase in the price for power made them a fortune.  After Enron's collapse, journalists used the Freedom of Information Act to release the emails sent/received by the employees of Enron.  Subsequently, the emails were analyzed to see who knew what and when.  Every news article, email, letter, blog, tweet, etc can be thought of as an observation.

It should be of interest to anyone wishing to see the  way statistical ideas play out within the brain sciences, and it  will provide a series of case studies on the role of stochastic  models in scientific investigation.  Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built  with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are  usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of  spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson  neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation  into frequency-based components.  In the visual system, V1 simple  cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in  the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and  CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized  using dynamic place models.  It has also been proposed that  perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian)  combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and  some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain  pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers.  Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise'' components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis. In neuroscience, however, the models also help form a conceptual framework for understanding neural function.  This course will examine some of the most important methods and  claims that have come from applying statistical thinking"

How do the topics change over time?  The Enron Corporation was an energy, commodities, and services company in Houston, Texas that went spectacularly bankrupt in 2001 after it was revealed that it was engaging in systematic, planned accounting fraud.   At its peak, it employed over 20,000 people with revenues over $100 billion.  Its downfall was related to deregulation of California's energy commodity trading and a series of rolling power blackouts over months.  For example, Enron traders encouraged the removal of power during the energy crisis by suggesting plant shutdowns.  The resulting increase in the price for power made them a fortune.  After Enron's collapse, journalists used the Freedom of Information Act to release the emails sent/received by the employees of Enron.  Subsequently, the emails were analyzed to see who knew what and when.  Every news article, email, letter, blog, tweet, etc can be thought of as an observation.  We characterize these documents by their length, what words they use and how often, and possibly extra information like the time, the recipient, etc.  Topic detection and document clustering methods are statistical and machine learning tools that extract and identify related documents, possibly over time.  These methods need to be flexible enough to handle both very small and very large clusters of documents, topics that change in importance, and topics that appear and disappear.  This class will emphasize application of methods and real-world data analysis.  Class time will be split into lecture and \"lab\".  (Bring your laptop.)

Despite the scientific consensus on its existence, causes, and consequences, a substantial number of Americans and citizens of other countries still question these conclusions and a small but vocal group of doubters continue to challenge the science and scientific consensus on climate change. In spite of some social division over these issues, governments at local, national, and international levels have made concerted efforts to craft policies to address climate change. These policies have shifted over time as the information, attitudes, and technology associated with climate change have evolved. In this course, we will explore the challenges and complexities of climate change by investigating the subject from a variety of angles: scientific, political, rhetorical, cultural, economic, technological, and ethical.

The topics are intended to enable students to understand which materials are feasible for 3D printing. Accordingly, high power density welding methods such as electron beam and laser welding will be discussed, along with the characteristic defects. Since metal powders are a key input, powder-making methods will be discussed. Components once printed must satisfy various property requirements hence microstructure-property relationships will be discussed because the microstructures that emerge from the inherently high cooling rates differ strongly from conventional materials. Defect structures are important to performance and therefore inspection. Porosity is a particularly important feature of 3D printed metals and its occurrence depends strongly on the input materials and on the processing conditions. The impact of data science on this area offers many possibilities such as the automatic recognition of materials origin and history. Finally the context for the course will be discussed, i.e. the rapidly growing penetration of the technology and its anticipated impact on manufacturing."

This course will test the current capabilities of the desktop 3D printer, and explore the ways in which it can be used to develop architectural massings and details. Through the iterative process, we will test your original designs at a number of scales, from site context to the building to the component.  While there is no prerequisite for this course per se, it is expected that students understand the basic fundamentals of architectural drawing conventions (plans, sections, elevations), and/or are conversant in 3-D modeling programs (Sketchup, Revit, Rhino, etc).

The semester will be broken in to 3 parts:Intro/Exploration and a long term project. In Intro/Exploration, students will have many hands on opportunities to start to build a common language to describe spacial investigations as well as creating them. This will consist of short projects, with each design investigation progressively building upon the previous exploration; these early projects will consist of both individual and group work. They will focus on Making.  The second half of the semester will consist of one long term project to be created individually, incorporating students? personal theories of architecture based on an overarching question.  Studio work will be supported by group discussion based upon critical review of student work, readings, slide presentations, videos and films. There will also be a few field trips. Students are encouraged to explore their own areas of interest with respect to their work in class. Self-motivation, class attendance and an open mind is mandatory, however, no prior architectural, engineering or artistic experience is required. Students are expected to perform work both inside and outside of class. Students should be prepared to purchase various supplies throughout the course.

We continue to emphasize architectural drawing and models (both analog and digital) as the primary means of architectural communication, but also as a method of creatively exploring and rigorously testing fundamental architectural ideas.  We investigate, research, analyze, diagram, and apply lessons from local architecture, and great architecture of the past, in studio, and in the parallel survey of architectural history.   We introduce the use of ?systems,? ?computational thinking,? and ?rules? in the design process to create order, deal with a range of parameters, and satisfy specific performance criteria.  Beginning with more abstract formal design exercises, and ending with the design of a small building, we explore how tectonics, joinery, materials, as well as site, orientation, context, and human use can be harnessed to inspire great design.  The design process is still carefully controlled, but students are encouraged to begin to speculate and take careful risks."

As Isozaki put it: ?Architecture is a machine for the production of meaning.?  We?ll investigate many ways that architects have theorized the design process, as well as the forms, materials, and contexts of architecture, to express a myriad of ideas and sensibilities.  We?ll also look at the ways that buildings can communicate and have meaning, often beyond the intent of the architect, and usually changing over time.  Some of the topics to be explored include the classical orders, gothic geometry and mystical light, the theatrical space of the Baroque, architecture parlante, character, and style in the Enlightenment, tectonics as structural expression, political architecture and morality, the aesthetics of functionalism, Expressionism, key terms such as ornament, representation, linguistics, and semiotics, as well as more recent theoretical constructs such as embodiment, materiality, atmosphere, and affect.

We move up in scale from the individual and group to the community to consider our designers' biases in how we analyze the human needs, how we judge the quality of space and subsequently, how we apply this knowledge to our own design work. Students develop a research question and test it in field research using observation, interviews and surveys. They draw conclusions about the quality of a space and place and how to improve it. Students should leave this class with the ability to discern a problem, experience in applying their understanding of behavioral settings and the human condition to specific research foci, and the ability to use their knowledge and skills deftly in practice, where time and resources are limited. Assignments will be a mix of individual and group work, with emphasis on the latter. There will be an emphasis on reading relevant literature, field investigations and understanding research methods and collaboration for applications in practice."

It aligns with the transactionalist understanding of perception and considers perspective as partly invented and partly discovered truth.     2)The Order of Appearance, which is built on the early work of the perceptual psychologist, J.J. Gibson, and aligns with the ecological  position of Gibson and his followers  It considers perspective as an absolute truth of the visual field.    3)Perspective Imposed, which aligns implicitly with the position of Gestalt  psychology.  It treats perspective as an imposed schema.      Along the way some use is made of on-going design work for subject material.  Work is submitted in 3 portfolio submissions of 3-4 weeks duration each."

In fact ancient cities and archeological sites, from the hills of Troy to the archeological sites of Pergamon and Ephesus, to the cities of Athens and Costantinople/Istambul, will be studied not so much as signs of the important Greek and Roman past of the region, but as the object of late Eighteenth and Nineteenth century rediscovery. The rich vestiges of the mythical past of this region were then brought to the light, in the frame of complex and adventurous missions. The eyes of scholars, travelers and artists filtered and transformed the reality of the ancient objects and places, adding to their fascination and vitality and changing the way we perceive this legacy today. At the same time though, a new political agenda, new biases and new aims were connected with the rediscovery. These in turn influenced not only the way the past of the region was explored and the way the finds were studied and exposed, but also the cultural debate in the rest of Europe, with important effects on the architecture of the main European cities."

A recurring picture of the \"American Dream\" has typically included the image of a single-family, detached dwelling set within its own green yard in the suburbs.  However powerful and durable that image is, the history of house and home in America is actually a far more complex story with many different twists and turns. In the course we will look at both urban and suburban housing choices and cultures, ranging from single family detached dwellings to multi-unit housing, and across a social spectrum income, class, race, and gender. Through the use of occasional field trips, we will use Pittsburgh as a touchstone for understanding broader national trends in the history of American urban and suburban housing. The course is organized as a lecture course supplemented with field trips and discussions based on field trips and primary source readings.  The additional time slot on Thursday afternoons will be used only when field trips are scheduled. Student work will include a research paper and several shorter written assignments throughout the semester."

The goal of the Design Integration of Active Building Systems course is to familiarize students with active building systems and integrative design strategies that should result in high levels of occupant comfort in commercial buildings that approach net zero energy and net zero carbon emissions   Active systems introduced in this class include: electrical lighting; mechanical ventilation; active heating and cooling; water systems for interior and exterior use and water heating, including solar; onsite electricity generation with renewable energy; building transportation systems; and active fire protection &amp; smoke control.  Because of the breadth of this subject area, the course will be future-focused, concentrating on design approaches and technologies that appear to be well-suited to a net zero energy and net zero carbon future.   Prerequisites: successful completion of 48-116, 48-215 and 48-315 or their equivalent is expected.  No prior knowledge of active commercial systems and systems integration is assumed, but students are expected to understand heating and cooling load calculations, to be able to identify factors in building design that affect those loads, and to quantify their impact.

The Southwest conjures different images, perhaps of adobe pueblos, Spanish friars, arid ranches, and the color turquoise. The built environment of the Midwest, the California coast, the Mississippi Delta, and many places in between reflect particular regional identities that have been both unconsciously and consciously created over time. This course examines the historical development of regional patterns in the American built environment. It investigates how and why a regions architectural identity evolved in the ways that it did. To what degree is place something to respond to, to interact with, and to what degree is place something that is created? Our focus will be primarily pre-20th century when the forces of vernacular traditions were stronger, we will also examine more recent trends of regionalism as an aesthetic choice and a theoretical stance."

Similarly, issues of waste removal, mechanical systems and natural materials that characterize current concerns have illustrative historical roots in numerous civilizations going back centuries and even millennia in pre-Industrial or non-industrial cultures. This course will engage texts and examples relating not simply architecture, landscape and urban history, but also art, philosophy and popular culture as a means to understand the many precedents for today?s interest in sustainable architecture and planning.

The work in which they are involved often does not materialize in their lifetimes; in fact, the duration of the projects are so long twenty, thirty, fifty and hundred year timeframes, it is more than likely that he or she will pass on before the project reaches fruition.    The trouble with predicting the future is that it is so uncertain, so undecided, so unknowable.  A brief look backwards reveals that we are not the first generation to consider the future.  History is replete with predictions, some of which were actualized, the vast majority of which were not.    Today's forecasts for tomorrow vary wildly.  A handful of optimists view the future through rose colored glasses, whereby humanity is delivered to salvation via technological wonders and the widespread adoption of common social values.  A larger group predicts the end of the world as we now know it, but even they cannot agree on the cause of our demise, with those arguing that climate change will kill us clashing with those convinced that we will be destroyed when robots achieve technological singularity.  Shy of total extinction, however, any vision of the future requires designers, and will likely occur in urban (or formerly urban) locations.  As of this decade, for the first time in history, more than half of the world's population, almost three and a half billion people, live in towns and cities.  Estimates suggest that by 2030 this number will swell to almost five billion."

Global issues of energy use, emissions, resource depletion, and land use are forcing building professionals to re-evaluate standard design and construction processes, and look to more environmentally friendly practices. The U.S.Green Building Council (USGBC) developed green building rating systems entitled Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEEDTM) in order to define \"green building\" by establishing a common standard of measurement. LEED considers green building methods and technologies in several categories including site, water, energy, materials, and indoor air quality, and awards points towards an overall green building rating of certified, silver, gold or platinum. Currently, LEED registered projects make up 3% of the current U.S. commercial building market, and Pennsylvania is the third leading state with LEED registered projects. There is now a demand for design professionals with knowledge and experience not only in sustainable design but specifically with the LEED rating system as well. This course will provide students with background knowledge of the USGBC, the LEED system, as well as referenced standards related to specific topics. The course will benefit greatly from the large number of LEED projects in the Pittsburgh region, which will serve as case studies. Upon completion of the course, students will be prepared to take the LEED Professional Accreditation Exam, which is quickly becoming the standard of recognition for green building professionals."

Students will discover how architectural ideas and theories reoccur, and even the oldest theories have contemporary relevance. The course will begin with the fundamental questions: What is theory in architecture? What is architecture today? How has our understanding of architecture and theory evolved historically to get to this point? How will it continue to transform into the 21st century? The topics covered will vary from year to year to acknowledge the dynamic nature of the  profession, environment, and global context. The work of the seminar will focus on intensive readings, especially of primary sources, weekly presentations and discussions about the sources, and a research paper on a theoretical aspect of architecture that might lead to a thesis or grant proposal.

At the outset, we will discuss specific definitions of a net-zero building and the implications of each definition. Through case studies, lectures, field trips, outside reading and assignments, we will examine how a net-zero building is achieved, including the use of renewable energy to achieve the net-zero balance. We will apply lessons learned from metered examples to real sites and to new design or renovation projects in Pittsburgh and will use simulation software to test and quantify the impact of our design/renovation strategies. We will also compare our strategies to requirements in US codes and rating systems such as IECC-2012 and LEED for Homes to evaluate their impact in moving the US residential sector toward much higher performance buildings. Although our focus is residential, many of the concepts and strategies we cover have parallels in the commercial sector. Students who enroll in the class must know how to calculate without software heat loss and heat gain for a small building.

Historically, early programs applying these capabilities were designed to operate on their own, on very narrow tasks, based on pre-programmed knowledge. Today, we have the ability to design human-computer systems in which both human and computers act intelligently, adapt to the world and learn from experience, improving their performance over time.  How do we design such collaborative systems, taking advantage of the fundamentally different ways in which humans and computers act and learn? How do we build smart systems that achieve their intended goals, with a minimum of unintended side effects?  The mini-course will give students the opportunity to address such questions. After an introduction of some basic concepts and techniques in AI and data science (only a basic familiarity with statistics is assumed), the course illustrates both the potential and current limitations of these techniques with examples from a variety of applications.  We spend some time on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of human decision-making and learning, specifically in combination with AI systems.  Exercises will include close examination of the inputs and outputs of various technologies with the goal of learning to select appropriate technologies for a given problem and anticipate design implications. Each student will also complete a final project that takes a project from start to finish (framing the problem, choosing data sources, exploratory data analysis, basic modeling, communicating results)."

Flexibility, versatility and the capacity to quickly adapt to evolving situations have become the critical challenges. The course is based on the new edition of Prof. Evans' book \"Super-Flexibility for Knowledge Enterprises\" (co-authored with Prof. Bahrami from Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley). Specifically, we will focus on the new rules of \"super-flexibility\" needed for continuous recalibration and adaptation.  This course is intended for MIIPS (Pittsburgh) and MS-SM (SV) student status, or permission of instructor."

Students may make photo books, for example, or decide that their images will be seen digitally on screen. While students are making photographs, we will explore the rich traditions of photographic story-telling that range from the world-oriented work of photo-journalist W. Eugene Smith to the documentarians such as Walker Evans, Nicholas Nixon, and Alec Soth. We will look at photographers, too, who construct fictional worlds, such as Duane Michals, Cindy Sherman, and Gregory Crewdson. As students make their own narratives, we will look at the interplay  between words and photographic images; how images are paced and scaled to create rhythm; how photographs are sequenced to tell stories; and other formal elements involved in creating visual narratives. 12-15 students.

Informed by Manfred Max-Neef's classification of fundamental needs and other relevant materials, we will create two in-depth photo-essays, the first being a study of ourselves, the second being a study of someone who is unfamiliar to us. In the first half of this course, while looking at the tradition of self-portraiture in photography and other media, we will be making in-depth photographic stories of ourselves. In addition to photographs, we may make scans of objects, include personal artifacts and anything else that may contribute to building an in-depth self-portrait. In the second part of the semester, we will apply what we learned to a person who we do not know, in hopes of bringing new insights and methods to understanding for another. In addition, we will look at the rich literature that exists in documentary photography about representing \"the other.\" By the end of the semester, each student's work will be made into a hand-made Japanese stab book of two volumes: a volume on oneself, and one on another.

In fact, many of us have grown so    accustom to the abundance of information in our lives that we expect    and need it to be accessible virtually anywhere and anytime.    Technological advancements, which seem to develop at lightning speed,    continuously provide us with tools that make it easy for us to access    information quickly. However, little is being done to aid people's    understanding of information that is increasing in complexity. Why?    Our addiction to accessible and thorough information has caused many    of us to turn a blind eye to the perceptual problems associated with    its speedy delivery.    In this course we will investigate contemporary visualizations of    information and the bearing of their forms on the quality of    communication. We will also study how peoples' perception of content,    interaction with others, belief systems, and mental and physical well    being can be affected by the visual communication of information.    Thus, although we CAN represent information various ways we will ask    how SHOULD it be designed to aid people's understanding of it. Your    explorations will take the form of analyses of existing artifacts;    class discussions and exercises; short, relevant readings that    originate in various disciplines such as cognitive science,    architecture, learning science, and design; and corresponding projects    that enable you to illustrate what you're learning."

Creating conceptual models are often an important step for making the creative leap from user research findings to design implications, which is one of the core challenges in design process. Conceptual models are also effective tool to bring in shared understanding for different stakeholders in teams with multidisciplinary team members, user-participants, and clients. Moreover, these conceptual models often directly lead to final information products to support users to learn how to use complex systems.     Conceptual Models is a full semester course that provides students with the opportunity to explore theories related to conceptual models and to improve skills in using them as a means of design. Being primarily developed for graduate and undergraduate students in Design, this course consists of two parts. The seminar part of the course will provide students with readings, examples, and in-class discussions to help them understand the nature of conceptual models. The project part of the course will provide an opportunity to apply these theories to actual projects. Students will work in individuals and teams to create conceptual models for different needs and goals in design process."

We will explore the fundamentals of service design in this lecture/studio class. In the first part of the class, we'll begin with a set of modules on tools and practices of service design. Then, you'll put them to use in a group project, in which you design and prototype a service. Our goals (and the objectives of this class) will be to learn service design fundamentals by hypothesizing, experimenting, building, testing our assumptions, sometimes failing, tweaking, and improving.

Or, as some writers suggest, does the camera interfere with experiencing the world fully.  This course explores seeing with the camera and the many issues that arise when one snaps the shutter. We will be looking at a range of different kinds of photographic images, understanding their contexts, and how to read them. Designers and other visual people use photographs extensively in their work.

More importantly, I am looking to facilitate skill development using narratives as a medium for design students to present and pitch the intent of their designs based on five core principles.    intentional positioning (empathize with your audience)  restraint in preparation (concise structure)  simplicity in design (visual congruence with design artifact)  clarity in rhetoric (know your message)  naturalness in delivery (be yourself)    Upon completion of this class, students will have mastery in the Five Core Principles mentioned. They will be able to:    Identify and cater to their audience's needs  Empathize with their audience and adjust accordingly  Craft a narrative that captures their design intention(s)  Visually compliment their design in their presentation  Clearly develop their message (pitch)  Develop and present in their own style"

The service sector has been increasing substantially while the commodities and manufacturing sectors have experienced a steep decline. Yet, service providers have historically under-utilized design in its business strategy and development.      During this project course, intended to work in conjunction with Designing for Service Seminar, we will extend the idea of design as more than aesthetics and provide the opportunity for students to practice embodying its perspective and process, mapping design theory to project process. Students will spend the semester in teams, working with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette to deeply understand their users and stakeholder's experiences, needs, and desires. We will explore the role of journalism and news in society, the volatile sector as a whole, and the challenges facing newspapers in America. The human-centered design approach will employ ethnographic research methods, allowing for teams to uncover insights and observations about patterns. Students will in turn learn to synthesize these findings into appropriate models, prototype concepts, and look for opportunities. The design solutions are intended to inform elements of the paper's competitiveness, creativity, development and future service innovations. The final deliverable will be refined solutions as illustrated in a presentation and process document."

For designers trained to shape futures defined by uncertainty and change, these exponential times represent unprecedented creative opportunities for innovation. In this course, students explore methods and tools for design in exponential times to shape uncertain futures. Students will explore the forces that drive change in the future (i.e., social, economic, political, environmental, technological), and learn to align innovation strategically with the trajectories of those forces.  The design project that drives everything else is the future of mega-metropolitan regions, the hubs of innovation where 70% of people in the world and 75% of Americans will live in 2050. In the semester long project, students create scenarios for Life 2050 in Metro 3.0, using Pittsburgh as a locus and focusing on a project within urban systems such as Sustainable Production &amp; Consumption, Lifelong Learning, Human Development and Resilient Community."

Specifically, we will be analyzing and reflecting on the phenomenon of interactivity by studying how mediums like interactive print, film and cinema, tangible board/tabletop games, and installation art can be employed using the frame of \"Other\" futurisms (sinofuturism, afrofuturism, indofuturism etc.) that are part of the general practice of speculative and science fiction throughout the world. We will engage with popular and fringe cultural texts and artifacts, so students should be prepared to spend time watching movies, playing games, reading books etc. in an analytic, reflexive manner in order to better understand the different strategies that authors have developed in order to evoke specific responses in their audiences.  In this class, you will bring the technical skills required - the object will be to collaborate with others with complementary skill-sets in order to create one lavish, intricate transmedial project that will draw people into the depth of its world.

The course instructor is one of those writers, having won three Game of the Year awards for his RPG stories and designs and then moved on to become a playwright, greatly influenced by his time Gamesmastering role playing games. The class will first examine and dissect RPG story and design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both design as well as storytelling 'best practices.' Once the groundwork has been laid, the class will be divided into three-to-five-person writing teams. Then, taking an existing pen-and-paper RPG system proceed to create and pitch a set of campaign adventure stories for that system and that story intellectual property. The pitch will then be fine-tuned and approved, and the students proceed to 'flesh out' their new story, delivering a full prose treatment, followed by Act breakdowns, mission arcs, dialogue for select scenes, and one shooting script for a two-minute cinematic. The final product is a hard copy story bible portfolio-quality piece. The class grade will primarily be based on every students individual quality of writing and story crafting. It should be emphasized this is a writing course, not an RPG design course.  To gain final admittance to the class you must submit an original two-page sample original dramatic scene (TV, Screenplay, Stage Play) to the instructor."

Students in this course will read and write about game design, and design many games of their own. Do not mistake this for a course in computer game development. This course is focused on the rules and methods of game design, which remain fairly constant regardless of the technology used to develop a game. While technology will play a significant role in our studies, technological details will not be our focus. You will study and design games of all sorts: card games, dice games, athletic games, story games, and yes, even video games. How to design games, how to design them well, and how to see your designs to completion will be what you study here.  Students not meeting the prerequisite will  could gain access to the course by answering questions to the course instructor.  Question 1: What is your name, and what degree program are you in? Question 2: What is your current GPA? Question 3: What are three of your favorite games? What is it you like about them? Question 4: Have you ever designed any games? If so, tell me about them, and what you learned while making them. If not, why not? Question 5: What is it that you hope to accomplish as a game designer?

        "course_description": "Game Design, whether in video games or tabletop games, uses a set of techniques to manipulate the player emotionally. For young designers, the technology often gets in the way of learning how best to hone their skills as game creators. When tabletop and board games held the majority of the marketplace, young designers might create and ship 3-4 titles a year. The frequency allowed them to learn and make mistakes as they became more experienced. With the typical video game development cycle of 9 months to 1 year minimum from start to finish, designers cannot experiment as much as they can in the tabletop space to hone their skills. This class allows designers to build and test a complete paper prototype, and in so doing acquire skills which would allow them to self-publish their title if that is their goal.  This course will have two sections. Students should consider which type of game they wish to design before registering. Section A: students will build a board game prototype; in section B students will build a role playing game prototype.  Included in the expected weekly work load is time that must be set aside for playtesting."

Commedia dell'Arte gives them the tools to tackle physical comedy from any era, past or present.  In the second half of the term students discover their personal Clowns.  This clown has nothing to do with the American Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus clown; this is not a character or caricature, but rather a revelation of the clown each student hides under the mask of adulthood. Discovering this clown gives them all a way to laugh at themselves, to uncover what makes each individual uniquely funny; it also lets them see how we only laugh at truth and in the personal material lies universal humor.  Inside this freedom is the technique to know what's funny and why, and the ability to apply these rules in comedy."

These working groups create projects over the course of the semester which are shown in informal presentations. The emphasis is on process, not product &#8212; devising an interdisciplinary performance requires a keen focus on combining creative invention with a rigorous structure of concept development &#8212; both of which are explored here. We also examine the work of several significant contemporary theater artists whose work approaches collaboration across a variety of disciplines. Artists have included: Ariane Mnouschkine, Dumbtype, Complicite, Ralph Lemon, Robert LePage, and more. Students learn to define and distinguish these artist's approaches through viewing video excerpts, readings, and discussion. This class is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional production modes and beyond each student's individual discipline. We focus on the process of creating a theatrical language which truly integrates disciplines."

These working groups create projects over the course of the semester which are shown in informal presentations.  The emphasis is on process, not product &#8212; devising an interdisciplinary performance requires a keen focus on combining creative invention with a rigorous structure of concept development &#8212; both of which are explored here.      We also examine the work of several significant contemporary theater artists whose work approaches collaboration across a variety of disciplines. Artists have included:  Ariane Mnouschkine, Dumbtype, Complicite, Ralph Lemon, Robert LePage, and more.  Students learn to define and distinguish these artist's approaches through viewing video excerpts, readings, and discussion.     This class is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional production modes and beyond each student's individual discipline.

Considering theater as an ancient technology of mass participation and social cohesion, this fusion studio explores how emerging technologies can expand upon the basic theatrical relationships in new and culturally relevant ways.  Collaboration and integration of design, media and storytelling is critical to this approach.  Experimentation with new forms can reanimate the basic values of theater; the essential nature of a live event, the possibility of visionary spectacle, and the creation of meaning in dialogue with an audience. Expanded Theater is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional theatrical production modes and beyond each students individual discipline. The curriculum combines resources from Carnegie Mellons Schools of Art and Drama, Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology (IDeATe), the Emerging Media Masters (EM2), Computer Science, the Robotics Institute, and their collaborators across the university in a new configuration. Expanded Theater will explore domains ranging from site specific and networked-based performance and interventionist practices, to pervasive social media technologies and their influence on interpersonal communication. The goal is to investigate contemporary languages that allow authors, actors and technologists to collaborate in ways that push beyond our present understanding of theatrical production and reception."

        "course_description": "FUTURE STAGES combines options from the School of Drama in a new configuration: through working collaboratively across disciplines, students investigate multimedia approaches to contemporary theater and new ways of storytelling. Directors, designers, actors, and dramaturgs work in groups to generate original ideas, images, texts, and material in a workshop environment. These working groups create projects over the course of the semester which are shown in informal presentations.  The emphasis is on process, not product &#8212; devising an interdisciplinary performance requires a keen focus on combining creative invention with a rigorous structure of concept development &#8212; both of which are explored here.    We also examine the work of several significant contemporary theater artists whose work approaches collaboration across a variety of disciplines. Artists have included:  Ariane Mnouschkine, Dumbtype, Complicite, Ralph Lemon, Robert LePage, and more.  Students learn to define and distinguish these artist's approaches through viewing video excerpts, readings, and discussion.   This class is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional production modes and beyond each student's individual discipline. We focus on the process of creating a theatrical language which truly integrates disciplines."

There is no longer a single model for a rewarding life in the world of music ? we must learn to adapt to the constantly evolving landscape of the 21st century. We must hack the music world! While examining new approaches to distribution and publication, we will also explore the question of how electronic media is redefining our understanding of music-making itself. Does a new album necessarily need to be a fixed set of sound recordings? What if it was a mobile app that reacts to the listener?s environment? What if our new album used mutating algorithms to generate new musical experiences every time the listener hits play?

        "course_description": "In the 400-year arc of opera history, the last 125 years have seen the genre's apogee, perigee, and current renaissance. Between the Wagnermania of the late nineteenth century and today's vogue for both opera and \"popera,\" new opera production slowed greatly in the third quarter of the last century as composers rejected its traditions and audiences turned increasingly to rock and pop. In this course, we will survey this trajectory by viewing and analyzing eight repertory staples:    Wagner   Parsifal  Debussy   Pell&#233;as et M&#233;lisande  Puccini   Turandot  Berg   Wozzeck  Gershwin   Porgy and Bess  Britten   Peter Grimes  Messiaen   Saint Fran&#231;ois d'Assise  Reich   Three Tales    We will also become acquainted with other works related to these staples, from Strauss to Saariaho and Tan Dun, and ask numerous questions. What can these operas' characters and techniques tell us about late modern subjectivity? What happened to the great national traditions? In what musical styles has opera flourished and languished? How have audiences changed? How has the notion of opera itself changed, from the nature of its heroes and heroines to its performance forces and media?     The goals of this course are to 1) promote intimate knowledge of the eight core operas; 2) encourage familiarity with numerous related opera plots, opera composers, and twentieth- and twenty-first-century musical styles; 3) broaden literary and musical analytical tools to include historical, aesthetic, and (multi)cultural perspectives on opera; and 4) improve oral and written communication skills about opera.    Requirements: Attendance at opera screenings, readings, quizzes, small written assignments, and a 17  to 20-page research paper on an opera of your choice written since 1850.

Then we examine The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, and The Magic Flute at a pace of about one act per class session, looking at poetry, dramaturgy, stagecraft, acting, performance practice, character development, theme, and politics, always through the filter of Mozart's music, especially its melody, reform elements, blurring of genre and affect, vocal counterpoint, use of topics, and musical symbolism."

How did the Western classical tradition come to be mastered in countries worldwide?  Where is it resisted and why?  When composers from non-Western traditions engage with classical traditions, what do they give up and what do they gain?  In what ways do they seek to retain style traits or instruments from their home country? and why?  Do countries all adopt this tradition in the same way and for the same reasons?  How do such varied negotiations of cultures define national identities? This course addresses such questions by focusing on the role of Western classical music in the history of the United States, Turkey, and Japan - countries with very different histories of engaging with European culture, yet sharing a decisive adoption of European-based modernity in the twentieth century."

        "course_description": "In his 1970 manifesto Expanded Cinema, Gene Youngblood presented the idea that emerging video technology would lead to an new form of cinematic expression in which art and life are united. In this course we will explore this idea in the realm of music through the creation of new technologies that will expand the possibilities of live performance. The technologies we develop will be used in a series of public concerts by CMU's Exploded Ensemble, a group of high-caliber musicians dedicated to electro-acoustic performance of avant-garde concert music. The course will work closely with the Exploded Ensemble to develop expansive technologies that will transform the music the group performs. These transformations may take place in many different modalities. In the realm of sound we will investigate several areas: the development of new software for sound processing and synthesis, the creation of new instruments, and experimental methods of sound amplification and distribution. In the visual realm, we will develop software for live video performance, will investigate experimental techniques for video projection including mapping and the use of depth cameras, and will develop tools for computer controlled lighting systems. In the physical realm we will develop wearable technologies for performers, sensor-based responsive systems, and will explore experimental approaches to costume and decor."

Originally conceived as an inquiry into the growing problem of noise pollution in Vancouver, the Project expanded to encompass the wider study of the relationship between sonic environments and human communities, both historical and present. From a small group of sound researchers making field recordings in natural landscapes and urban areas has grown the modern study of Acoustic Ecology on a global scale, and also the creative practice of Soundscape Composition, in which recorded elements of sound environments are expressively explored through electronic music. Beginning with a history of the WSP, this course surveys aspects of the field of Acoustic Ecology as an aesthetic, political, and ethical phenomenon, with special attention to its relationship with the creative and sound practices of \"Soundwalking,\" \"Deep Listening,\" and Soundscape Composition. This course will also contextualize the WSP within a broader history of music and sound in the background, including Satie's Furniture Music, Muzak&#174;, and coffee shop music.  Throughout the course, students will participate in the activity and design of soundwalking, sonic field documentation / recording and sonic-environmental sampling, and the performance of background music. The course will culminate in a soundscape project entailing the composition of a Soundscape work, or the presentation of a creative mapping of aspects of their own sound environments; special guests will provide students with instruction in sound capture and manipulation."

Photography, performance, conceptual proposals, installation art, film, video, and appropriations from mass culture play an equal part in contemporary visual culture. Duchamp's attack on art as an institution set the tone for other anti-modernist projects to follow which did not accept the \"white cube of the gallery\" as their sole exhibition space (or measured worth as an artist). His notions of \"indifference,\" (critique of aesthetic judgment), reproducibility, simulation, performativity, artist-as-curator, and interactivity between the spectator and the work of art set the stage for a host of innovative explorations by artists ranging from the Combines of Robert Rauschenberg to the Mod-Spaceships of Mariko Mori. This seminar examines a tumultuous period in contemporary art and culture from 1960 to the mid-eighties, with special excursions into the aesthetics of commodification, phenomenology, materialism, conceptualism, semiotics, abjection, and technology. The impact of social movements and American foreign policies (i.e. Vietnam, Civil Rights, The Women's Movement, Globalism, the Aids Crisis) on the production and reception of contemporary art will also be examined.

This course satisfies the EMS-2 (60-210: Interactivity) requirement for BFA and BXA-Art majors. As with EMS-2, students in this course will develop an understanding of the contexts, tools, and idioms of software programming in the arts. Unlike EMS-2, this course additionally satisfies the computing portal requirement for CFA and Dietrich students pursuing IDeATe minors and concentrations. (Students with no prior programming experience should register instead for 15-104, 15-110, or 15-112.)  This is a \"studio art course in computer science,\" in which the objective is art and design, but the medium is student-written software. The course develops skills and understanding of text-based, imperative programming techniques in a variety of popular open-source arts-engineering toolkits, including p5.js (JavaScript), Processing (Java), and openFrameworks (C++), with the aim of applying such skills to interactive art and design, information visualization, generative media, and other creative cultural practices.   Rigorous programming exercises will develop the basic vocabulary of constructs that govern static, dynamic, and interactive form. Topics include the computational manipulation of: point, line and shape; texture, value and color; time, change and motion; reactivity, connectivity and feedback; interactive graphics, sound, and simulation; and the incorporation of various modes of input (sensors, cameras) and multimedia output."

The class consists of students from different disciplines who collaboratively synthesize and implement several systems in a short period of time. The course is organized around a large set of essential skills that students must gain in order to effectively tackle physical computing problems. It is then deployed through a series of quick group projects that utilize the essential skills and challenge students to not only consider HOW to make things, but also for WHOM we design, WHEN the time is ripe, and WHY the making is worthwhile/necessary. Upon completion of this course the students will be able to: work in a mixed physical-digital environment and laboratory, make effective use of standard hardware and software tools for physical computing, approach complex physical computing problems with a systematic overview that integrates iterative research and design steps, generate systems specifications from a perceived need, partition functionality between hardware and software, produce interface specifications for a system composed of numerous subsystems, use computer-aided development tools for design, fabrication and testing and debugging, evaluate the system in the context of an end user application or experience."

In the past this might have been called Public Art, but today new strategies are being used that challenge public art's tradition of static sculptures and embrace more dynamic forms of public engagement. As its name implies, Contextual Practice embraces the context or social conditions in which an artwork exists as part of the material of that work. Evolving out of the history of site-specific, conceptual, and performance art practices, Contextual Practice covers a range of exciting new methods to making art in the public including street art, interactive social media, environmental art, hacktivism, participatory art, guerilla performance, project-based community art, and urban interventions.   Students in this field-based class will create projects that work with the social dynamics of a variety of on and off-campus and online public contexts. We will research new trends in public engagement through art, architecture, and design, as well as politics, ecology, sociology, and economics.  Fundamentally, this class asks students to experiment with how their art practice can intersect directly with the real world (outside of the traditional art venues) and how they can proactively create new sites and audiences for their work."

With an eye to how changing theories of performativity have influenced how artists think about what it means to \"perform,\" this seminar, in a sense, will be engaged in both philosophical and aesthetic research about how technology has changed the conventions of performative artistic practice. What was the role of technology in the dematerialization of the object of art? How have ideas about virtual, parallel worlds changed the way artists think about the \"performing body?\" If technology once acted as a prosthetic device, increasing an artist's sensual and perceptual world, what happens to the role and impact of an artist's work in the seemingly inert realms of programming or the increasingly autonomous areas of Robotic Intelligence?"

Expanded Theater will reanimate classical modes of performance with media, networks, robotics, locative applications, and mobile systems. Considering theater as an ancient technology of mass participation and social cohesion, this fusion studio explores how emerging technologies can expand upon the basic theatrical relationships in new and culturally relevant ways. Collaboration and integration of design, media and storytelling is critical to this approach. Experimentation with new forms can reanimate the basic values of theater; the essential nature of a live event, the possibility of visionary spectacle, and the creation of meaning in dialogue with an audience. Expanded Theater is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional theatrical production modes and beyond each student's individual discipline. The curriculum combines resources from Carnegie Mellon's Schools of Art and Drama, Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology (IDeATe), the Emerging Media Masters (EM2), Computer Science, the Robotics Institute, and their collaborators across the university in a new configuration. Expanded Theater will explore domains ranging from site specific and networked-based performance and interventionist practices, to pervasive social media technologies and their influence on interpersonal communication. The goal is to investigate contemporary languages that allow authors, actors and technologists to collaborate in ways that push beyond our present understanding of theatrical production and reception. This course alternates between two modes of research and design."

This is a project course open to majors in chemistry &amp; art. The course &amp; its projects are designed to expand the expertise of students in each discipline, while exposing them to the methods, demands, &amp; aims of the other.     Historically, the craft of painting was closely linked to the practice of pigment manufacture, with painters procuring their materials in raw form directly from the chemist/apothecary, &amp; often performing themselves the final purification &amp; grinding of the minerals into pigments. Color has been used by both artists &amp; alchemists as a benchmark for tracking changes while creating new materials based on minerals found in nature. With the advent of mass-produced &amp; marketed art materials in the nineteenth century, the distance between chemist &amp; artist increased until the two worlds have little to do with one another. This class aims to reconnect the two disciplines for a study of their common ground. Students will learn about the origin of the color of minerals with primary focus on colors that originate from electronic transitions &amp; will work collaboratively on hands-on laboratory research projects that involve the synthesis, characterization, &amp; use of inorganic pigments. In the studio, they will make their own egg-tempera paints, &amp; use them in painting projects designed to increase color skills as they learn about the history of pigment use. Students will collaboratively design &amp; carry out final projects which combine research, experimentation &amp; creative work.

More and more contemporary artists are pushing beyond the conventional media and methods of the art world by strategically operating as \"professional\" amateurs. The term amateur reflects a voluntary motivation to create as a result of personal passion for a particular activity, regardless of expertise or authority. For the artist, embracing the role of the amateur allows for the use of any profession, institution, or social activity as a possible material within their creative practice. This includes artists who \"perform\" as amateur preachers, psychologists, geneticists, politicians, and exotic dancers; artists who create amateur institutions like sanitariums, circuses, hair salons, talk shows, and planetariums; and artists who collaborate with professional hypnotists, ornithologists, stunt coordinators, ventriloquists, and diplomats in order to manifest their work.   Students in this class will work on self-defined projects that utilize the role of the amateur as a critical method for expanding the breath and reach of their art practice into new forms and venues. With faculty mentorship, each student will be responsible for developing their projects through independent research, apprenticeships, and collaborations with experts in fields relevant to their work. Workshops, lectures, and in class critique of ongoing work will look at contemporary trends related to amateurism in art practice, theory, and the world at large.

In these contexts photographs often work with words to convey meaning, whether they are shown with captions, news stories, or just with titles. Photographs can work without words, too, to create purely visual narratives.  In this course, students will make two series of photographs: one that is fiction and one that is non-fiction. In addition to making photographs, students will determine the context in which their photo-stories will be seen. Students may make photo books, for example, or decide that their images will be seen on a website.  While students are making photographs, we will explore the rich traditions of photo-graphic story-telling that range from the world-oriented work of photo-journalist W. Eugene Smith to the documentarians such as Walker Evans, Nicholas Nixon, and Alec Soth. We will look at photographers, too, who constructed private worlds, such as Duane Michals, Cindy Sherman, Bruce Charlesworth, and Laurie Simmons. As students explore both fiction and non-fiction through photographs, we will look at the interesting interplay between words and photographic images; how images are paced and scaled to create tempos; how photographs are sequenced to tell stories; and other formal elements involved in creating visual narratives.

        "course_description": "Invented in 1839, photography was a form of visual expression that immediately attracted a large public following. Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands.  One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children.  The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture.  These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century.   This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles \"Teenie\" Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others. Classes include a slide lecture, student presentation, and video segments that introduce a focused selection of images by major photographers in an attempt to understand their intentions, styles, and influences."

And while the story of Viennas cultural and political turmoil is interesting, it probably would not command our attention today were it not for its role as the birthplace of Modernism. In an effort to understand todays intellectual environment, therefore, we will examine Vienna before the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. We will be looking at a huge and at times confusing canvas which by necessity includes almost every aspect of culture. We will start with politics and history and move on through art, architecture, crafts, psychoanalysis, literature, music, and philosophy. We will be looking at art nouveau buildings and furniture, reading literature, viewing films, and listening to recordings - and we will build 3D models on a digital map which will help us understand how the different arts were all connected and influenced each other.

Philosophers have addressed these questions by producing subtle, intricate, and often beautiful arguments. In this seminar, you will assess those arguments and produce your own. You will learn to think like a philosopher - to strip an argument presented in prose to its bare essentials and produce a visual representation that displays its structure plainly. Learning to visualize arguments in this way will improve the clarity and rigor of your own thinking and writing. It will put you in a position to make progress on hard questions such as those above.

When it comes to statistics, we often run into trouble when we rely on intuition - we can't trust our own eyes. In this class we will tease apart some entertaining but important statistical paradoxes and biases. For example: Why are better health outcomes reported when only medical screening improves? How could David Justice have a better batting average than Derek Jeter in both 1995 and 1996 separately, but not in 1995-1996 combined? Could most published research findings actually be false?

As human activities increase the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, scientists have established the reality of climate change and have estimated its impacts on human society and the natural world. Despite the scientific consensus on its existence, causes, and consequences, a substantial number of Americans and citizens of other countries still question these conclusions and a small but vocal group of doubters continue to challenge the science and scientific consensus on climate change.   In spite of some social division over these issues, governments at local, national, and international levels have made concerted efforts to craft policies to address climate change. These policies have shifted over time as the information, attitudes, and technology associated with climate change have evolved. In this course, we will explore the challenges and complexities of climate change by investigating the subject from a variety of angles: scientific, political, rhetorical, cultural, economic, technological, and ethical. Over the course of the semester, we will inquire: What is climate change? How do scientists know it is happening? Why is there public debate over it? What solutions are available?

But inequality strikes us an especially timely topic because of the current demands for greater political, social, and economic equality. The four of us will use the disciplines we come from - economics, anthropology, history, psychology, and literary/cultural studies - to introduce you to the concept of inequality in the age of capitalism. We will consider how inequality emerged as a social and political problem in the 18th and 19th centuries, and how it has re-emerged as a key concept for socio-political movements in our current moment. We will conclude with an inquiry into what the future of inequality might look like, especially with the coming of increased automation and the elimination of at least 50% of the jobs currently being done by human beings."

In 2011, Luis Suarez a Uruguayan soccer player was punished for allegedly calling French footballer Patrice Evra \"negro\" in England. But was the word \"negro,\" said in Spanish, racist? Racism is a complex phenomenon that refers to historically hierarchical power differences between groups (e.g. Native populations and Europeans during the conquest), ideas about how humans can be classified into groups by \"race,\" and also discriminatory practices against non-dominant groups. This system of social relations and ideology serves to justify social inequality and differential treatment.  If we are to end racism, we must strive to understand it. What are the historical origins of racism? How is racism reproduced? How does race influence identity formation? Can racism produce positive identities? Why has the struggle against racism shifted from a demand for human rights to a search for diversity and inclusion?

In a time of big data and widespread skepticism of science, it is crucial to understand how data and facts can be turned into conclusions, and then into public policy. Using topics from medicine, epidemiology, and public health, this course provides students an introduction into the grand challenge of understanding how evidence is used (and abused) in support of scientific conclusions. Questions of health and disease are particularly important areas for thinking about facts and figures because many life-or-death decisions have to be made on the basis of fragmentary and unreliable evidence. Every trip to the doctor, illness, and vaccination involves a complicated mix of public policy, scientific evidence, and emotional and historical factors. This course helps students understand the sciences and the humanities as united in their desire for rigorous argumentation rather than as competing or incompatible ways of thinking. Moreover, by taking a wide-angle lens to the topic, students will see how and why standards of scientific proof have changed over time, and track what these changes mean for thinking about evidence. Co-taught by a statistician and historian, this course draws on many different disciplines, providing students a broad introduction to reasoning across the humanities and social sciences.  Students will be required to participate in written and oral arguments, read scientific articles as well as political, historical, and legal documents, and prepare a capstone project in which they will be asked to weigh real-life evidence and recommend a course of action to the Food and Drug Administration.

Presently, we have little choice but to attend to this rapidly anxiety-ridden question.

        "course_description": "Self Defense for Women - is a course specifically designed to increase women's awareness of potential sexual assault and to provide physical techniques to respond to such an act.  It is intended for women only because it is believed that the presence of males in class (other than instructors or other authorized persons) can alter the emotional and physical responses of women to class material and thereby hinder their ability to reach course objectives.  It is of the utmost importance that women be able to maximize their opportunity to learn in the company of like-minded students.  The core of the course is based upon the principles of the Rape Aggression Defense System (R.A.D.)which was conceived and developed by Larry N. Nadeau.  His goal in developing R.A.D. is also its motto:  \"To develop and enhance the options of self-defense, so they may become viable considerations to the woman who is attacked.\"  This course is composed of three sections:  risk reduction principles, physical defense techniques, and simulation.  Risk reduction principles include a thorough review of personal self-awareness &amp; the environment, whether in the home, neighborhood, or unfamiliar community.  Physical defense techniques include the introduction to bodily strikes with hands, kicks with the feet, and defenses against grabs &amp; holds.  Simulation is the activity that attempts to incorporate, via physical demonstration, all emotional &amp; physical techniques that have been taught through the acting out of scenarios involving instructors (padded/protected) as attackers, and students (padded/protected) responding to the assault."

In this course, the most important methods and techniques underlying mathematical optimization are studied. These include linear programming, integer programming, and nonlinear programming as basic mathematical methodologies. Based on these, we also consider methodologies for particular problem classes such as network models and traveling salesman problems. During the course we will emphasize mathematical modeling, that is, creating a mathematical description that reflects a given practical problem described in words. Motivated by these mathematical models, we then discuss the necessary mathematical techniques for finding optimal solutions. Lastly, we consider the solution of these problems using optimization software, i.e., we represent the mathematical models in Excel and use Excel Solver to compute an optimal solution."

Applications can be found in e-commerce, sales, marketing, finance, operations, etc. In this hands-on introductory class, you will learn the basic concepts and techniques of data mining in addition to when and how they can be applied to improve many aspects of business and consumers' welfare. We will discuss the marvelous power of data mining concepts and tools applied to data via troves of current real-world examples, such as recommender systems, customer segmentation, etc. Throughout the course, we will use R, a powerful open-source statistical language and one of the main tools in data mining and business analytics, fast becoming a mainstream tool. With this tool, you will learn about variety of exploratory and predictive data analytics techniques such as Na\u00efve Bayes classifier, nearest neighbor approaches, decision trees, clustering algorithms, etc."

In this course, we will explore the most recent scientific research in marketing, psychology, and behavioral economics on judgment and decision-making. We will develop your ability to understand and influence what people want, how people decide what and when to buy, and whether people will be satisfied or dissatisfied with their decisions. These psychological insights are particularly useful for marketing strategy, brand positioning, and marketing communication decisions, but also yield insight into common biases in judgment and decision making, beyond marketing, to which you would otherwise fall prey.  Why people are willing to drive across town to save $5 on a tank of gasoline, for example, when they would not drive a minute to save $5 on a refrigerator. We will discuss some of these applications in class.  In addition, we will examine the methodology of market research (specific to consumer behavior) to build the tools you will need to interpret and base decisions on it."

This course is the introductory finance course in the undergraduate business program. The main topics covered in the course are Financial Markets, Net Present Value, The Objective of the Firm, Discounted Cash Flow, Portfolio Theory and the Cost of Capital, The Efficient Markets Hypothesis, The Capital Structure of the Firm, and Business Valuation. Time permitting, the course will also provide an introduction to option markets and derivative securities. Upon completing the course a student will be able to consider a large and complex business problem, make some assumptions, structure the firms' cash flows in a spreadsheet, calculate the value of different solutions to the problem, and make a decision."

What is important to them? How do they decide which companies to invest in and which not? This class looks at funding from the funder's point of view and provides the student with a framework of the investment process: investment criteria, sourcing, selection, due diligence, deal structure, valuation, post investment involvement. Real companies seeking funding are used for the final project in which students will be expected, as investment teams, to make investment decisions and convince their fellow investors (the class) to join them (or not).   This is a highly interactive and project class. There will be multiple guest speakers.   Prerequisites: Students are highly encouraged to take any of the introductory entrepreneurship classes offered in various schools and departments. While no financial background is required, this class will not cover the basics of entrepreneurship from the entrepreneur's perspective, but will be looking from the investor point of view."

The main goal of the course is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of how financial reports provide unusually specific and detailed (but not perfect) information about certain risks and performance of these financial institutions. Their financial statements increasingly are based on fair value accounting and their financial reports include increasingly extensive risk and estimation sensitivity disclosures. Both fair value accounting and risk and estimation sensitivity disclosures are necessary ingredients for financial reports to convey financial institutions' risk and performance in today's world of complex, structured, value and risk partitioning financial instruments and transactions. While financial institutions often report imperfect (or worse) fair value measurements and risk and estimation sensitivity disclosures, careful joint analysis of the information they do provide invariably yields important clues about their risks and performance.   While this course is most relevant to students interested in financial institutions, much of the accounting material also pertains to a varying extent to other types of firms. For example, many firms securitize their accounts receivable or hedge their commodity, interest rate, or foreign exchange risk using derivatives."

This sector accepts deposits from the public and issues loans, and thus the banking sector expands in response to positive changes in retail, corporate and government business demand.  Similarly, if a slowdown occurs this results in a reduction in demand for banking sector services.  As a result, the important starting point for a financial analyst, who wants to assess current and future economic growth, are the financial statements of banks and the information they contain.  To extract this information, however, requires being able to read and interpret the financial statements of a bank.  These statements are very different from reading traditional corporate financial statements.  As a result, the first objective of this course is to learn how to read financial statements generated from the banking sector including how to interpret and evaluate these statements.  The banking sector in Qatar is unique because it has two important and separate subsectors &#8212;- Islamic and conventional banking.  Each of these subsectors have a different banking business model which in turn generate differences in their financial statements.  As a result a second important objective for this course is to learn how to read and evaluate the financial statements from each of these subsectors."

        "course_description": "Real options analysis is an approach to the management of operational assets that exploits managerial flexibility in decision-making and combines it with market-driven valuation of cash flows. This approach assumes that managers use all the available information when making decisions. It is thus particularly useful when managing projects that involve dynamic and state-contingent choices among alternatives (options), especially of a strategic nature. Examples include investing in and developing new products or technology, expanding/reducing manufacturing capacity, and suspending/resuming production. The valuation of financial options is the conceptual basis of real options management (but this course does not assume prior knowledge of this topic). Real options analysis extends this fundamental market-driven valuation approach to a much broader spectrum of business applications that feature dynamic decision-making. It thus contrasts the standard net present value rule used by static discounted cash flow analysis. The resulting managerial decisions and asset valuations can be very different when real options analysis is used rather than static discounted cash flow analysis. The course learning objectives are to (i) develop the students ability to take an unstructured problem and implement real options analysis in a structured manner; (ii) integrate market-driven valuation and dynamic decision-making techniques into a practical, yet rigorous, business analytics toolkit; and (iii) provide examples of successful practice and applications in a variety of industries."

        "course_description": "Pricing is a critical marketing decision which enables a firm to translate customer value into profit. This course provides a first survey of pricing concepts. Instead of discussing pricing in isolation, we focus on the interplay between pricing and other aspects of marketing, such as positioning, branding and advertising. To this end, we provide a formal treatment of pricing concepts in the framework of game theory. Finally, we also discuss non-pricing tools that firms can use in order to capture customer value. Specifically, we cover cases wherein firms generate a profit while keeping their services free, a phenomena that is widely observed among Internet firms. This course has no formal prerequisite, but a willingness to study formal (i.e., mathematical) models is assumed. Any previous exposure to microeconomics analysis and game theory will be helpful."

IMC is specifically designed to ensure that all communication strategies and messages are unified and integrated across all channels and, importantly, begin with the consumer/customer.  It is critical that marketers understand the limitations of marcom tactics as well as how to best leverage and integrate marcom tactics for the strongest, most consistent and authentic brand voice in the targeted marketplace.  The entire IMC process is driven by the customer, and in the case of our discussions in this class, the consumer.   The course is designed to help students understand the integrated marketing communications model, the strategy and tools of the marketing mix and what makes an iconic brand.  The course is designed in five sections:  Part One focuses on understanding brands - iconic brands, terminology and types of branding.  Part Two focuses on the understanding of consumer behavior - one of the, if not the most critical part of understanding marketing.  Brands are built and defined in the minds of consumers.     Part Three focuses on IMC and the framework used by brand management to develop strategy, and understand audience segmentation and brand positioning to drive IMC.    Part Four focuses on understanding the IMC tactics available to marketers including advertising, social media and digital marketing, events and public relations.     Part five concludes with the deeper study of an iconic brand."

The investor's perspective (supply) requires the use a set of tools to evaluate, structure and price financing deals.  The tools include discounted cash flow, the VC method, comparables analysis and real options.  Venture capitalists act as financial intermediaries and provide both capital and guidance to entrepreneurial firms.  These facts introduce unique twists on valuation and deal selection.

Some of the questions the course will ask include the following: In the industrialized world, the public sector (government) plays a much larger role in Europe than in the United States. Why is this so? How does this affect the quality of everyday life for different classes of people? How have globalization and technological change affected the distribution of income and social policy in industrialized countries, and how does this affect the public sector? In some tribal societies, people have no access to markets at all. How does this affect distributive behavior within communities? Finally, what might be the ultimate causes of income inequality on a global scale? Are there prehistoric and environmental roots in the ways peoples of different societies live today?

In this course, we will use the emerging field of social networks to put structure on this diverse mass of connections. Using a mixture of theoretical, empirical, and computational methods, we will learn about the structure and function of social networks. We will look at how an individual's position in a social network reflects her role in the community. We will learn to identify tastemakers and trendsetters by looking at how information moves through our increasingly connected society. We will consider how our own position in the social network affects our behavior, opinions, and outcomes. And we will explore where social networks come from, and what affects their structure. The material in this course will be interdisciplinary, drawn from the fields of math, computer science, physics, sociology, political science, and economics. By the end of the course, you will have the tools and knowledge needed to analyze social networks on your own. The course is capped with a project where you will use your skills to answer your own questions. (Lecture, 3 hours). Minimum grade of \"C\" required in all economics pre-requisite courses.."

You will learn to analyze pricing strategies including versioning and bundling; product standardization decisions; managing product complements; exploiting network effects; managing platform competition.  This course will help you understand the unique economic characteristics seen in today's technology-intensive markets and how they impact the strategic interactions among firms and consumers. We will study, for example: Why firms in the IT industry give away their best products for free. Why makers of video gaming consoles subsidize end users (but tax game developers) while computer operating system makers subsidize software developers (but overcharge end users). Why Sony won the Blu-Ray format war against HD-DVD which was sponsored by a whole array of companies. In order to understand how firms strategically interact with consumers in technology-intensive industries this course will use a combination of simple but rigorous analytical models, emerging theories, and formal case studies.

In this course, we investigate the many forms that wastes may take. How much do our daily lives depend on plastics? What happens to our cell phones and computers they turn into \"e-wastes\"? How do certain communities encounter wastes differently? And what role does waste have in establishing and maintaining social inequalities?    We will learn from histories of waste such as Edward Humes' Garbology: Our Dirty Love Affair with Trash.

In this course we will read novels, poems, and periodical extracts by a diverse body of nineteenth-century female authors as a means of better understanding women's historic and aesthetic impact on Victorian culture. While some of our authors are well known, like the wildly popular poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, we will also encounter the 'lost' author, journalist, and controversial anti-feminist Eliza Lynn Linton. The writing of Victorian women exemplifies important social debates from the nineteenth-century. Social taboos such as divorce, suffrage, Bloomerism, children out of wedlock, and women in the workforce were all topical in Victorian culture. As the conflicted and introspective heroine of George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss reminds readers, the role of marriage as a woman's sole profession was becoming increasingly untenable in the modern era. Victorians were forced to ask what other function were women fit to occupy. From the Pre-Raphaelite poetry of Christina Rossetti, to the gothic horror of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, \"the woman question\" served as a lightening rod for a variety of nineteenth-century cultural anxieties. The woman as deviant and criminal which we will encounter in Mary Elizabeth Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret was an especially controversial aspect of the female-dominated genre of \"Sensation Fiction.\" Margaret Oliphant records in an 1867 review from Blackwoods: \"What is held up to us as the story of the feminine soul as it really exists underneath its conventional coverings is a very fleshy and unlovely record.(See Dept. for full desc.)"

It has been said that the teenager is the most free and least happy of all living beings. Given America's current obsession with youth culture, it's hard to imagine a time when the word \"teenager\" did not exist. However, this word came into being largely as a result of the post World War II boom in consumerism when advertisers needed a new way to define an emerging demographic group with its own disposable income and spending power. Through a survey of twentieth century literature that focuses on the teenage experience, we'll explore the changing meanings of young adulthood over the last one hundred years. What is the relationship between the invention of the teenager and modernist aesthetics? What characteristics were considered markers of young adulthood in the 1920's? In the 1950's? In 2000? How are the experiences of angst, anomie and the unfulfilled American dream connected to modern Western life through the teenage subject? How do tropes of individualism, rebellion, freedom and resistance connect the literature of teen angst with other genres of American literature? How has teen angst been both an impediment to and the inspiration for cultural resistance and social change? To answer these questions, we will compare texts such as Philip Roth's Portnoy's Complaint, Anzia Yezierska's The Bread Givers, J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, Margaret Atwood's The Edible Woman, Dave Eggers' A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, and Banana Yoshimoto's Kitchen.

Spring 2014: For decades, communication researchers relying on stimulus-response theories associated a text with a single dominant stimulus evoking a single dominant response. This thinking widely influenced rhetorical understandings of language for decades as well. Today, rhetorical theories of language have discredited these behaviorist theories in favor of theories that see language as the constructors of situations rather than the effects of them. When speakers and writers use language, they resuscitate, enact, and perform worlds of experience from words. They create not only meanings but histories, identities, and social bids to initiate social change. This course introduces students to a theory and ontology of language study that is in keeping with language as a constructive activity.  Students will learn to use software designed to analyze texts qualitatively and numerically from a constructive point of view. The software works as a microscope to help you see patterns of language use that escape the limited attention span of even the most painstaking of close readers. After learning how the software works, we will do exercises with small textual samples so that students can sharpen their powers of observing language across families of patterns. Students are encouraged to analyze the texts they love most &#8212; from literature, politics, journalism, to their favorite blog posts, tweets, and Facebook posts.

Indeed, if tragedy is adolescent, then the mature, adult mode is the comic, being more social and rational. A key characteristic of comedy is wit-or simply intelligence. Comedy involves a lot of pure play of the mind.  It turns out that there have been a few notable attempts to help us understand just why comedy is the \"social\" genre beyond all others, why the comic attitude is the civilized, urbane, mature view of life. And we'll consider some of those theories while trying to understand why some things are comic and some are not.

        "course_description": "This course will attempt to answer a simply stated but not so simply answered question: What is (or was) the \"hip-hop\" generation? Bakari Kitwana gives us a very broad but useful rubric to understand whom that generation was in his 2002 book, The Hip-Hop Generation: Young Blacks and the Crisis of African-American Culture. For Kitwana it defines the first generation of African-American youth that grew up in post-segregation America. While useful, Kitwanas definition is also quite provocative since many of the earliest practitioners (and consumers) of what would eventually be called \"hip-hop\" were not all African-Americans but Greeks, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Jamaicans, Germans, Trinidadians, Mexicans, etc..., many of whom lived in America but also encountered hip-hop elsewhere on the planet. In our class we will take a broad, global perspective on the question of \"what is/was the hip-hop generation\" through scholarly and popular works by Kitwana. Jeff Chang, Tricia Rose and many others.  Given the significant media studies components of this course our class will lean heavily on musical, cinematic and televisual sources. Not only will you watch early fictional films about hip-hop like Wildstyle and Krush Groove but others like Matthieu Kassovitzs La Haine and Rick Famuyimas Brown Sugar which are influenced by hip-hop culture. We will also watch music videos as well as listen to singles and select albums like Queen Latifahs All Hail the Queen, Kendrik Lamars To Pimp A Butterfly, Die Antwoords Tension as well as read memoirs such as Jay-Zs Decoded."

Working primarily through Bordwell and Thompson's seminal text, Film Art: An Introduction, we will also learn the grammar of and various approaches to analyzing film. Additionally, we will trace the rise of the Hollywood studio system, understanding and situating its dominance during its golden age by watching movies that both represent and challenge the classical Hollywood mode. In the second half of the course, we will survey several national cinema movements, such as Italian Neorealism and French New Wave. And alongside a wide range of international films, we will consider many of the dominant strains within film theory, e.g., discussing auteur theory and watching an Ingmar Bergman film. To finish class, we will define the place of the big-budget, hybrid-form blockbuster in our increasingly global and interconnected context, interrogating the current state of the movies and moviegoing."

        "course_description": "Sometime around the late sixteenth century, enterprising cultural producers in early modern London began to develop a new commercial venture called 'playing': a business that offered ordinary people a few hours of dramatic entertainment for the price of one penny. In addition to watching the professional players onstage, spectators also participated in a form of play themselves, in a sense, because theatrical experience provided a unique opportunity to engage imaginatively with otherwise inaccessible people, worlds, and ideas. More than four hundred years later, the drama of the period now ranks among the most esteemed texts in all English literature, and the name 'Shakespeare' has become a byword for literary genius.   This course will offer an introduction to Shakespeare's tragedies and histories, including Hamlet, Macbeth, Antony &amp; Cleopatra, Richard II, Richard III, and Henry IV pt. 1. As we read through these works, we will endeavor to understand whatand howthey meant in their original context, thereby developing a historically informed perspective on their influence over our own cultural landscape."

We will also wonder: what does Shakespeare's late romance plays such as The Winter's Tale, or Pericles, often described as \"tragicomedies\" or as \"problem plays,\" tell us about the strengths and limits of comedy as a genre? In short, valuing those classics of the English literary canon simultaneously for the timeless craft and for the historically located cultural horizon that they evidence, we will explore what it means, as readers of Shakespeare, to take comedy seriously."

What audiences did and said in the theater could matter as much as the plays in the formation of public opinion.  A growing print media carried public consensus or dispute from the theater into coffee shops, taverns, and private libraries.  Instead of taking a traditional \"survey\" approach to this period in the English theater, we will study a succession of \"nights at the theater,\" specific performances of plays that happened on particularly eventful evenings when the playwhile significantwas not the only important performance.   The introduction of an actress to a king who would make her his royal mistress, the final performance of a beloved actor, and the violent riots that were frequent occurrences in theaters are examples of cultural performances that shaped public opinion.  We will read plays, of course, but also print and visual documents that speak to the moment of the play;  we will listen to music, and generally immerse ourselves in the social and political struggles over public opinion in a world that very much prefigures our current world of celebrity and fake news."

Every imaginable type of criminal activity has been depicted on screen, as have the legal ramifications of those acts. But these films raise profound questions. What is the nature of crime? What makes a criminal? Are there circumstances in which crime is justified? How do socioeconomic conditions affect the consequences? How fair and impartial is our justice system? Perhaps most importantly, how do depictions of crime and justice in popular media influence our answers to these questions? This class will utilize a variety of films to discuss the ways in which popular media portrays the sources of crime, the nature of criminals, the court and prison systems, and particular kinds of criminal acts. Films to be screened may include such titles as The Ox-Bow Incident, Out of the Past, 12 Angry Men, Young Mr. Lincoln, Brute Force, The Equalizer, Jack Reacher and Minority Report.

How should we think about, as opposed to merely reacting to, such sensations that preoccupy both public media and personal fears and fantasies?  This course will show that \"sensation culture\" began in the 19th century and has been ever since a key part of mass culture up to the sensations of the present. At the center of very different public \"sensations\" there could be serial killers, astonishing scientific discoveries, daring visions of revolutionary transformation, revelations of devastating poverty and over-the-top luxury and wealth.  Sensations powerfully affect the feelings, body, and imagination whether they are exploitative media concoctions or staggering revelations of the most serious social and natural secrets.  We will read across this range of Victorian sensations&#8212;from Dickens? Oliver Twist and the 1% vs. the 99%,  to the jolt produced by new theories of evolution (Darwin and Chambers), to alarming visions of revolution (Marx and Engels), to terrifying domestic secrets revealed in \"sensation novels,\" to the advent of the serial killer (Jack the Ripper and Mr. Hyde), to anthropologies of disease and death. We will see all of these in relation to the new Victorian mass print media that constructed these and other \"sensations\" to contemporary readers.  Readings in recent theory will help us raise conceptual issues about what makes a sensation and why some current cases (think epidemic, terror, climate change, vast inequality) help us grasp the history of producing and responding to painfully serious or pleasurably spectacular \"sensations.\""

This class will attempt to develop our abilities to read with care and attention&#8212;and feeling&#8212;in order to make us better readers of any artistic text. The challenges of the short form turn out to be excellent opportunities for learning a lot, in a little space. We'll make use of several inexpensive anthologies, and look at one or two central writers (Hemingway, for example) in more depth. The class will require the writing of a few short papers, engaging in online discussions on Blackboard, and three in class tests."

How does everyday performance define gender and sexual identity? How do gender and sexuality define everyday performance?  How does aesthetic performanceart, theater, film, digital media, poetryintervene in the ways in which gender and sexuality are performed?  Readings in theory at the intersection between gender studies and performance studies will help us explore these questions. We will also consider a variety of cultural and artistic practices.   The addition of simple performance prompts and exercises for students to incorporate into their research will blur theory and studio practices. Students will be encouraged to practice their theories surrounding performance within the classroom and in public space."

Why is Martin Luther King Jr. best remembered for saying, \"I have a dream,\" and not for saying, \"War is the greatest plague that can affect humanity\"?  What are political \"talking points\" and how are they perpetuated? How does a claim (unfounded or not) become a fact?  How does a fact become a myth? These are just some of the questions that we will consider. More specifically, this is a course in how meaning changes as texts created in one context and for specific purposes are repeated, cited, and used in other contexts and for other purposes, sometimes related and relevant, sometimes not. More technically, well be focusing on the rhetorical nature of intertextual discourse.  Our goal will be to examine the ways that people of all kinds including politicians, journalists, and scientists strategically draw upon and transform the statements, arguments, and evidence of other people to promote their own viewpoints or purposes. We will begin by investigating scholarship that views language as an extended conversation in which people struggle to have their own voices heard, and other voices countered or even suppressed.  Later, we will survey a number of studies that suggest how individuals and organizations recontextualize and reinterpret prior discourse for persuasive ends.  More specifically, we will analyze how the micro-features of the language (for example, qualifications, evaluations, and attributions) are used to persuade audiences that certain assertions are (not) factual, that certain speakers are (not) authoritative, and that certain proposed actions are (un)desirable.  Ultimately, you will conduct your own research on intertextual rhetoric on a topic of specific interest to your academic or professional goals."

Some of the relevant research questions include: Why do visual variations exist across different contexts? (e.g., Popular science looks different from Discover.) Why and how do visual styles change over time? (e.g., Magazines from the 1950s don't look like present day magazines.) Do visual elements have persuasive power? If so, what roles do they play in shaping an argument? How do people learn to communicate using visual-verbal artifacts? In this seminar, we will address these and other questions through readings and discussions on various threads of studies around the analysis of communicative artifacts that integrate visual and verbal expressions. We will review key research publications concerning visual-verbal communication from relevant disciplines, including professional &amp; technical communication, rhetoric, argumentation, and literacy. Particular attention will be paid to descriptive methods (e.g., social-semiotic analysis, visual argument, and rhetorical structure theory) and the types of questions these methods can help us answer. Throughout the semester, students will be encouraged to explore the visual-verbal communication artifacts found around them and use those to connect class discussions to the practice of design. Required assignments include a brief bi-weekly response to the readings, several short analysis papers, and a longer term paper with a topic chosen by students based on their professional or research interests."

The connections between sex, gender, and agency that she articulates are connections that early modern theater-makers, from Shakespeare to Aphra Behn, obsessively revisited as they created some of the most haunting characters of the canon, both tragic and comic. In this course, we will look at shrews, witches, she-devils, ranting widows, aspiring divorcees, sex workers, roaring girls, evil queens, and all sorts of nasty women that would tread the boards in early modern London. At the heart of those theatrical depictions lie strong cultural anxieties surrounding the desire and possibility to fashion, control, and disciplinein other words, to regulate and rule overfemininity in a time period that witnessed the invention of the \"two-sex model\" (Thomas Laqueur) and \"the cultural production of domestic heterosexuality\" (Valerie Traub). How did theatre participate in the invention of early modern femininity? How did performance relate and/or resist the discourses about women deployed in the domains of law, religion, medicine, economy, and politics? How did women of color specifically fare in early modern dramaturgy? And what changed when women were allowed to act and actresses replaced boy actors under the Restoration? To study unruly women in early modern drama, we will read plays by Shakespeare, Elizabeth Cary, John Webster, Thomas Middleton, Thomas Heywood, Thomas Dekker, John Fletcher, Aphra Behn, and others in conversation with contextual materials and theoretical texts from the field of Women's, Gender, and Sexuality studies."

Spring 2014: The hard-boiled crime novel, developed in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, depicts a world full of corruption and exploitation, where law does not necessarily equal justice.  But while early hard-boiled crime fiction was typically written by white authors and focused on white protagonists, African Americans soon found the genre particularly appropriate to depict their long experience with systemic racism and economic exploitation in the U.S.  In this class, we will explore how African-American authors like Richard Wright, Chester Himes, Walter Mosely, and Paula Woods appropriated the hard-boiled crime novel over the 20th Century to represent the effects of racism and economic inequality on the black community and American society and, in doing so, developed the genre into a unique expression of African-American history and identity.  We will also examine how the African-American crime novel is taken up by other cultural mediums like film and, more recently, the graphic novel to create new ways of expressing the genre."

Four years later it was officially declared a \"depression.\" When did all of this happen? Was it 2009? Or the 1930s? No, it was the depression triggered by the financial panic of 1873. Out of this period, also known as the \"Gilded Age,\" came a unique strain of American literature. Frank Norris's grisly tale of an overbearing dentist and his miserly wife, McTeague, Andrew Carnegie's autobiography, Upton Sinclair's iconic The Jungle, Edith Wharton's tragic love story House of Mirth, Charlotte Perkins Gilman's feminist utopian novel, Herland, William Dean Howell's capitalist satire, The Rise of Silas Lapham, Theodor Drieser's mournful Sister Carrie-all of these writings react to, and try to shape, the economy of a century ago. These novels, which were often critical of corporate capitalism, give us a rich and detailed picture of the last time in the US that Americans suffered under the kind of gap we have today between rich and poor. In the US today the top 1% controls 42% of the country's wealth, while the bottom 80% controls a mere 7% of the country's wealth.

        "course_description": "This seminar explores the representation of Islam and Islamic cultures in early modern English literature, from the late Middle Ages to the beginning of the eighteenth century. In the early modern period, England had a complex multifaceted relation to the Islamic world. Since the Crusades, England had thought of the Islamic world as a deadly religious enemy to annihilate, but at the end of the sixteenth century, the Islamic world was also a key diplomatic ally against the Spanish archenemy, a fabulously rich trading partner in the world emporium of the Mediterranean sea, and an efficient model of empire to emulate in the Atlantic world. As a result, the Islamic world came to occupy a central place in English national imagination and maintained that place throughout the seventeenth century. What fantasies about the Islamic world does early modern English literature reveal? How do religion, race, gender, and sexuality intersect in the formation of those cultural fantasies? Do authors reinforce those fantasies or pressure them? How do specifically English social, political, and cultural issues inform literary representations of Islam? What image of England emerges when English authors use Islam as a mirror for the nation? In other words, what do texts about Islam tell us about early modern England? To answer those questions, we will read across genres, comparing romances, epic poems, plays, travel writing, pamphlets, and essays, and we will set canonical authors such as Chaucer, Spenser, Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Milton in conversation with other illuminating early modern writers such as Richard Knolles, George Sandys, Robert Daborne, Henry Stubbe, and Mary Pix."

The conviction that the media would make us all sound the same revived with the widespread adoption of television, starting in the 1940s, and the development of the internet in the 1990s led to worry about how soon we'd all be writing the same. But fears of the homogenizing effects of the mass media on American English have proven to be exaggerated: Americans still talk and write in many different ways. In this course we explore why this should be. Why don't we all speak alike? Why do we need variation in language? We will explore how regional and social dialects and varieties come to be and what their functions are, and you will learn how to hear, see, and describe varieties of language. We will also touch on American languages other than English. Documentary films and online materials about language will be the basis for another strand of the course, as we work together to explore how linguistic variety can best be represented and explained in non-technical ways, and in a variety of media, for the general public. Reading will be mainly in two books: American English, by Walt Wolfram and Natalie Schilling-Estes (2nd. edition), and Language in the USA: Themes for the Twenty-First Century, edited by Edward Finegan and John R.

        "course_description": "The starting point for this course is a question at the nexus of theology, politics, and art that no less central to the age of Shakespeare and Milton than it is today: how should power be represented? Biographically, many canonical poets of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries worked as ambassadors, representing power abroad (Wyatt, Sidney, Donne, Marvell). Many more poets including Shakespeare and Milton thematized diplomacy, in both its divine and more worldly forms. What, then, can structures of mediation like diplomacy and angelic intervention tell us about works like Sidney's sonnet sequence Astrophil and Stella, Shakespeare's Hamlet, or Milton's Paradise Lost? And what can Renaissance poetry tell us about topics such as sovereignty, immunity, license, fidelity, automation, and accommodation? The course will include introductory and contextual readings from Genesis, Pseudo-Dionysius, John Calvin, Thomas Hobbes, Alberico Gentili, and George Puttenham.  Assignments and class discussions will be occasions to practice historically-informed criticism; to compare conceptual structures within seemingly distinct domains of history and thought; and to articulate major fissures and changes in Renaissance angelology, diplomatic practice, and literary craft."

Gertrude Stein seems to have started the whole generation naming fad with her comment to Hemingway, \"You are the lost generation.\" Paul Fussell identifies the cultural effect of WWI as the production of 'irony' as the central quality of modern identity (Some Beat writers make a similar claim for the effects of WWII). This class is neither a prequel nor a sequel to the Beat writers class; it is related in theme but focused on different writers and texts. Students might consider taking this class as a point of entry to 'The Beat,' or might consider this class as a follow-on to 'The Beat' in order to understand more fully some of the central literary and historical issues of our time.

This view of invention fundamentally shaped modern thought and continues to influence the ways we think and communicate today. In this course, we'll begin by examining the repudiation of rhetorical invention in the development of modern thought before focusing on efforts to recover a rhetorical understanding of invention from the mid-twentieth century forward, surveying a variety of contemporary theories of rhetorical invention including those promoted by postmodern, posthuman, and digital rhetorics.

Beginning with several works about regional/Islamic practices of veiling, we will look specifically at the close connections made between womens practices and elements of tradition, including religion.  With an eye toward historicizing feminist interventions, we will look at 19th century debates on sati, commonly called widow burning, in India, to see how certain issues became loci for global intervention during colonial periods and, later, for global feminist movements.  Within the contemporary period, we will turn to cultural, economic and political practices like female genital cutting, transnational domestic labor, global sex trade, and transnational forced marriage.

Work outside the classroom will involve several field trips to City of Asylum, a sanctuary for writers in exile. Working knowledge of a language other than English is helpful but is not required for this course."

This is a readings course in dramatic narrative where we will look at the strange, complex, and varied tool of artistic production called \"THE WRITER'S VOICE.   We will examine and analyze how voice works in different media including film, fiction and drama.  Texts could include the novels:  The Catcher in the Rye, The Lover, Lolita The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Everything is Illuminated, and the films of directors:  Spike Lee, Sophia Coppola, Richard Linklater, Wes Anderson, Quentin Tarantino."

There is now a generation of novelists, screenwriters, playwrights and TV writers who first honed their story-telling chops when they were a Gamesmaster of a Role Playing Game (RPG). The course instructor is one of those writers, having won three Game of the Year awards for his RPG stories and designs and then moved on to become a playwright, greatly influenced by his time Gamesmastering role playing games.  The class will first examine and dissect RPG story and design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both design as well as storytelling 'best practices.' Once the groundwork has been laid, the class will be divided into three-to-five-person writing teams. Then, taking an existing pen-and-paper RPG system proceed to create and pitch a set of campaign adventure stories for that system and that story intellectual property. The pitch will then be fine-tuned and approved, and the students proceed to 'flesh out' their new story, delivering a full prose treatment, followed by Act breakdowns, mission arcs, dialogue for select scenes, and one shooting script for a two-minute cinematic.  The final product is a hard copy story bible portfolio-quality piece. The class grade will primarily be based on every students individual quality of writing and story crafting. It should be emphasized this is a writing course, not an RPG design course."

Effective team leaders are able to recognize these contradictions and draw a writing group, a project team, a social organization or a workplace into what is called an \"expansive transformation.\"  That is, to innovate new ways of working together.  In this course, you will learn how to become more effective not only as a team member, but also a project leader, and even group consultant in your college work and workplace.  Looking at films, case studies, research, and your own experience, we will learn how to analyze how teams of all sorts are working, to communicate more effectively across different expectations and values, and to collaboratively innovate new ways of working together.

Through readings, assignments and class discussion, we'll tackle questions such as: What makes a story newsworthy? How does a reporter decide which points to emphasize? What are effective techniques for a successful interview? How does a journalist turn pages of scribbled notes into a coherent news story? We'll do a lot of writing, but we'll also examine issues and trends affecting journalism today. We'll cover at least two live events and hear from local professionals about working in print, broadcast and public relations.

Competing theories of what counts as \"literacy\" - and how to teach it - shape educational policy and workplace training. However, they may ignore some remarkable ways literacy is also used by people in non-elite communities to speak and act for themselves. In this introduction to the interdisciplinary study of literacy?its history, theory, and problems?we will first explore competing theories of what literacy allows you to do, how people learn to carry off different literate practices, and what schools should teach. Then we will turn ideas into action in a hands-on, community literacy project, helping urban students use writing to take literate action for themselves.  As mentors, we meet on campus for 8 weeks with teenagers from Pittsburgh?s inner city neighborhoods who are working on the challenging transition from school to work. They earn the opportunity to come to CMU as part of Start On Success (SOS), an innovative internship that helps urban teenagers with hidden learning disabilities negotiate the new demands of work or college. We mentor them through Decision Makers (a CMU computer-supported learning project that uses writing as a tool for reflective decision making.)

This course will have two main objectives: (1) to help you develop a repertoire of stylistic options and a critical vocabulary for discussing those options, and (2) to give you the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice when revising writing. Two recurring questions for us will be the following: if style depends on both the rhetorical situation of a text and knowledge of specific guidelines, how can we ever say that we have achieved ?good? style? Should stylistic rules or practical experience carry more weight in the decisions we make as writers?"

It is useful when instead of a single Aesop fable, you want to characterize Aesop's fables as a group and you want to compare them, as a group, with, say, the writings of a contemporary poet or the lyrics of contemporary musical artists. Corpus rhetorical analysis is also useful when you want to compare the styles of two columnists or critics based on a large sample of their writings.  It is useful when you want to understand the ?nuts and bolts? rhetorical choices that make software documentation a different professional genre from sports journalism or science writing.

And while the story of Viennas cultural and political turmoil is interesting, it probably would not command our attention today were it not for its role as the birthplace of Modernism. In an effort to understand todays intellectual environment, therefore, we will examine Vienna before the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. We will be looking at a huge and at times confusing canvas which by necessity includes almost every aspect of culture. We will start with politics and history and move on through art, architecture, crafts, psychoanalysis, literature, music, and philosophy. We will be looking at art nouveau buildings and furniture, reading literature, viewing films, and listening to recordings - and we will build 3D models on a digital map which will help us understand how the different arts were all connected and influenced each other.

Think, for a minute, about the fact that the novelist Tom Wolfe (Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test and Bonfire of the Vanities) got his PhD in American Studies at Yale (the first US American Studies program) in 1958. Wolfe says that his grad school exposure to sociology helped him to write about the importance of status for early astronauts in The Right Stuff. American Studies is a first cousin to Cultural Studies, but it is not exactly the same thing. In this course we will read mostly secondary texts &#8212; scholarly works &#8212; that are on the cutting edge of the \"new methods\" in American Studies, and the course readings will range from the Revolutionary War era to the present. Texts will include Christina Klein, \"Why American Studies Needs to Think About Korean Cinema,\" Jonathan Sterne, MP3, Brian Edwards, ed., Globalizing American Studies, Richard Purcell, Race, Ralph Ellison, and American Cold War Culture, Walden?s Shore: Henry David Thoreau and Nineteenth Century Science, Wonder of Wonders: A Cultural History of Fiddler on the Roof, The Networked Wilderness: Communicating in Early New England, Book of Ages: The Life and Opinion of Jane Franklin, Gaga Feminism: Sex, Gender and the End of Normal, Sense of Place and Sense of Planet: The Environmental Imagination of the Global, and Transatlantic Traffic and (Mis)Translations."

        "course_description": "This course offers students a chance to understand how English literature became modern.  We will explore the cultural and historical processes by which we get from Shakespeare to Austen by looking at the historical development of two media forms, the stage play and the novel.  Since this archive includes an impossible amount of material to cover in a semester's work, we will focus on some points of connection and synergy between these forms.  For example, we will read a novel and a play by Aphra Behn, a poet, playwright, spy and one of the inventors of the modern novel.  Eliza Haywood was both an actress and a prolific and successful novelist of the early 18th century.  One of the \"fathers\" of the modern novel, Henry Fielding, cut his literary teeth writing plays for the Haymarket Theatre, which he also managed (and Haywood acted in).  Frances Burney wrote a wildly successful novel, Evelina or a Young Lady's Entrance into the World, but she also wrote plays and was part of London literary circles that included famous actors, musicians, and other performers for the stage.  We will end with Austen's novel, Mansfield Park, which stages on its pages an amateur production of a play in order to reflect the pleasures and dangers of theatricality.  We will look at the interplay between theater and print fiction and how they mutually inform and help to define each other.  We will ask how public theatrical institutions and performances and the technology of print contributed to the modern world of proliferating media forms."

        "course_description": "This course has the dual purpose of introducing students to performance and celebrity studies and giving them experience in using these analytic frameworks to study 18th-century literature and culture.  Celebrity is a very modern phenomenon that first became a visible part of political, religious, and artistic culture over the course of the long 18th century, between 1660 and 1800.  We will investigate the genealogies of modern celebrity, considering such questions as, what do the Kardashians have to do with dead English kings?  What can cross-dressing actresses teach us about 21st-century drag performances?  (Full disclosure: Dead English kings and cross-dressing actresses will get far more of our attention than the Kardashians or modern drag artists.)    We will study some of the most powerful recent theories of performance and celebrity; we will read plays and other performance genres that took up time and space on the 18th-century stage.  In addition, we will explore beyond the London theaters to consider the nature of performance in its many cultural forms: What are the connections between theater and the quieter performances of political pamphlets, newspapers, and novels as they occupy physical and mental space in coffee houses and libraries?  Can a print text be performative?   Finally, we will examine various relationships between performance and culture.  How does performance in the early modern period shape gender and sexuality as well as class and race relations?    This course will count as an upper-level course for the Gender Studies Minor, as well as a pre-1900 period course for the EBA."

As conceptions of national identity were called into question with traumas associated with the First World War, Modernist writers attended to the tensions between wholeness and disintegration in the individual and in collective bodies. In Irish and British Modernism we will explore the tensions between illusions of a whole associated with political movements like nationalism and fascism and the disorienting though sometimes liberating forces of disintegration that surfaced in the essays, poetry, plays, novels and short stories of four Modernist writers: James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, William Butler Yeats and T.S. Eliot. American Modernism will be offered in the spring, which will build off elements of this initial introduction to Irish and British Modernism. Requirements for this course will include active participation in class conversations, bi-weekly response papers and a fifteen to twenty page research paper."

Reading a selection of their poems, essays, and critical theory in the context of contemporary debates, we will aim to understand the relation between print as a set of material forms, and political as well as literary ideas and discourses that contended for attention in the period's innovative print media We will also try to grasp some wider cultural processes at work in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. These included disintegration of the early modern Republic of Letters and the reconfiguration of its knowledges in the nineteenth-century cultural fields; the forming and division of new reading publics and their ways of reading print; important changes in book production, typography, printing methods (hand-press to steam press), and bookselling; and the crucially important relation between the aesthetic powers of the ?text? and the material pleasures of the \"book.\"      Research papers using rare-book materials at the Hunt or Hillman library Special Collections will be especially encouraged; and the course will sometimes meet in the archive to examine \"rare and curious\" modes of print.

        "course_description": "For most of us, the word \"propaganda\" triggers a familiar script. We tend to think of totalitarian regimes where the State controls information and prohibits the expression of dissenting views. We also tend to associate propaganda with certain rhetorical techniques - highly emotional words, deceptive representations, and glittering generalities that inhibit rational thought and manipulate public opinion. According to such popular views, propaganda is linked to the dissemination of false information and is antithetical to the norms of democratic society. Our class will challenge these assumptions. First, instead of confining propaganda to authoritarian governments, we will examine how propaganda functions within democratic society. Indeed, we will focus on domestic propaganda in America, especially political propaganda but also propaganda in advertising and public relations. Next, instead of focusing exclusively on deceptive rhetorical techniques, we will ask a more elemental question: What enables propaganda to circulate? Answering this question will force us to consider the routines and values of corporate media as well as the power relations that give some people special access to channels of mass communication. Certainly, we will also examine propaganda messages themselves, attending to manipulative tactics as well as rhetorical strategies used to induce uptake in the mainstream press. We begin our seminar by studying key theories of propaganda, looking at primary texts for various definitions and criticisms of the concept. We will then examine how powerful institutions, especially media organizations, manage the dissemination of propaganda in democracies. Finally, we will consider how to analyze propaganda, generating methodological prerequisites for scholarly study. Ultimately, students will have the opportunity to conduct their own research on propaganda as it relates to their academic and professional goals."

Spring 2013: Ever since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution and the rise of the technological exhibition in the nineteenth century, there has been a growing presence for science and technology in the lives of everyday citizens. In some cases, these phenomena have sparked the public's imagination and their promise has stirred their confidence in a better future. In other cases, they have kindled fears and generated protests over the risks of new technologies and the threats of novel scientific ideas to prevailing social, cultural, economic, and political orders. This course examines the complex dynamics in the relationships between science, technology, and society. Towards this end it engages with questions such as: How do we decide who an expert is? To what extent do scientists have an obligation to consider the social and ethical consequences of their work? Is public education about science and technology sufficient for addressing social concerns about risk and controversial scientific ideas? We will grapple with these and other questions by exploring modern public debates in which science, technology, and society play a primary role such as the AIDS crisis, global warming, and the autism vaccine debate. With the help of analytical theories from sociology, rhetoric, and public policy, we will develop a general framework for thinking about argument and the dynamics of the relationship between science, technology and the public. In addition, we will look to these fields for tools to assess specific instances of public debate and to complicate and/or affirm the prevailing theories about their relationship.

Why and how do visual styles change over time? (e.g., Magazines from the 1950s don't look like present day magazines.) Do visual elements have persuasive power? If so, what roles do they play in shaping an argument? How do people learn to communicate using visual-verbal artifacts? In this seminar, we will address these and other questions through readings and discussions on various threads of studies around the analysis of communicative artifacts that integrate visual and verbal expressions. We will review key research publications concerning visual-verbal communication from relevant disciplines, including professional &amp; technical communication, rhetoric, argumentation, and literacy. Particular attention will be paid to descriptive methods (e.g., social-semiotic analysis, visual argument, and rhetorical structure theory) and the types of questions these methods can help us answer. Throughout the semester, students will be encouraged to explore the visual-verbal communication artifacts found around them and use those to connect class discussions to the practice of design.

A particular emphasis will be placed on personal subjectivities to counter the rumor that individual selfhood began with Shakespeare (the inventor of the human, according to Harold Bloom). Some of our texts are reflective, some are outrageous, some are charming, some are funny; all are populated by human beings we can recognize in spite of the unfamiliar styles in which they are presented.

In this class we will read a mix of cultural history, film studies, music studies, literary studies, art history, television studies, and cultural theory.

Part of the first wave of \"quality television\" series by which HBO changed the way people conceived of the artistic possibilities of the medium, the Wire differed from its contemporaries like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under in its realism and its smaller audience. Unlike most other shows on television, The Wire addressed the racism, poverty, the failures of the criminal justice system, and other social problems head on. It was able to do this in part because it had enough time to develop complex story threads. This moment of TV history produced what I am calling \"long-form\" TV, in which narrative continuity was stretched over multiple seasons. TV in this form resembles 19th century novels that were first released serially in magazines and newspapers.  In both cases, audiences waited expectantly for new episodes, since they could not be \"binge-watched.\" The Wire was rooted in producer/writers David Simon and Ed Burns' experiences in Baltimore, where the former had been a crime reporter and the latter a police detective. Simon has said that he made the series in order to tell truths about the city he could not tell in the newspapers.    This course will consider the wire in the context of realist fiction of the 19th century, twentieth-century crime fiction, earlier TV crime series, and other long-form TV, including Mad Men.

A significant body of contemporary fiction focuses on imaginative and physical movement across national borders.  This global literature course combines literary and theoretical readings to examine the experiences of transnationalism and diaspora.  Theories of transnationalism look at the interconnections that cut across nations.  The concept of diaspora, a term first used to reference the movement of a people out of a homeland, has become a way to think about the identities of immigrants, migrant workers, and refugees.  Readings for the course will be drawn from a diverse group of writers from around the globe.

In early sixteenth century Europe, race was a complex system of power distribution that relied primarily on religious or rank-based difference. With the development of colonization and color-based slavery in the Atlantic world, the early modern racial matrix produced a new paradigm: Europeans started thinking about physiological difference - for which skin color was a shorthand - in racial terms too. How were those various racial paradigms (religion, rank, skin color) represented in one of the most important mass media of the time - theatre? How did those paradigms interact in one given play or one given national culture? Did they reinforce or work against one another? Which features were specific to nationally defined racial epistemes? Which features circulated across national borders? How did the translation and mistranslation of racial notions from one culture into another shape a sense of shared whiteness in early modern Europe? Which performance techniques did actors use to impersonate racial others, and what effect did those techniques have on spectators? In short, how did early modern theatre participate in the making of race? To answer those questions, we will focus on a rich corpus of plays staging Jews, Moors and Blackamoors, New World Indians, Gypsies, and Turks. We will read plays by Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, and Moli&#232;re (among others) in conversation with secondary readings drawn from the field of Critical Race Studies.

Example, Spring 2010: College seems a space apart, before you enter the real world. Accordingly, we don't think of fiction and film that depicts life in college as all that serious. However, there is a growing tradition of fiction of university life, whether of students or professors. In particular, a great many prominent contemporary writers have written novels set on campuses, and a number of major film directors have turned their lights on university life. In this course, we will survey the realm of college fiction and film, from F. Scott Fitzgerald to Michael Chabon. We will try to put together its history, distinguish its major types, and diagnose its contemporary representations. We will also look at relevant historical, theoretical, and sociological works that bear on the university. There will be several short papers and one longer final paper."

This course, an introduction to the cultural study of law for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students, can be seen as an introduction to what goes into the making of such a statement.   Where do we get our ideas about law? What do we mean when we say \"law\"?  What counts as law? How does culture influence law, and law, culture?  And to what degree should historical context condition any answers we might be tempted to give? Students in the course will study works in a range of genres (novels, plays, poems, judicial opinions, pamphlets) and develop methods for investigating ways that law and culture have been made by one another from the 16th-century to the present.   Readings will include influential theoretical accounts of law (Aristotle, Hobbes, Cover, Habermas, Bordieu, MacKinnon), canonical texts in Law and Literature (Shakespeare's Measure for Measure, Melville's Billy Budd, Kafka's The Trial) and some \"weird fiction\" by the novelist/legal theorist China Mi&#233;ville.    As a counterpoint to the fiercely anti-historical \"law and economics\" movement, however, the course will put special emphasis on rooting intersections of law and culture in rich historical context, considering both local and international legal contexts (sometimes in fairly technical detail) alongside so-called \"ephemera\" of culture. Students will tackle the especially fruitful \"case\" of Renaissance Britain before developing final research projects, whether on the Renaissance or another period of their choosing."

In this course we explore this process with respect to language.  We look at the history of language standardization and its relationship with political and economic history, exploring when and why different ways of speaking and writing become more alike, both as an automatic result of social interaction and as a planned result of policy.  We look at the language ideology that gives rise to and undergirds standardization and the rhetoric that gets used to forward it.  Then we explore reasons for and mechanisms of localization in language. What ideas about language, communication, and identity underlie attempts to push back against standardization, and what rhetorical strategies forward these ideas? We then turn to three case studies: arguments about Global English versus local Englishes and ways of using English, ongoing struggles over the standardization of the Putonghua variety of Chinese in China and the development of regional and national standards in Taiwan and elsewhere, and the history of Catalan, a regional dialect that has become a quasi-national standard in the Catalunia region of Spain.  In addition to presenting and leading discussion on two of the readings, students will be expected to complete two 500-word writing assignments and undertake a substantial original research project that expands on one or more of the themes of the course.

Even in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with international trade and slavery supporting the manor house and plantations abroad providing the cotton for British looms, the \"England\" of English literature spanned the globe.  By the first half of the twentieth century, this empire had begun to collapse in upon itself, a process witnessed by writers inside Britain and its colonies.  This course will investigate British literature within the international context of global imperialism.  A section on gothic stories takes us into the realm of popular culture with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Arthur Conan Doyle's short stories.  We take to the seas with Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim, before we consider W. Somerset Maugham's exploration of sexuality in the tropics in The Painted Veil.  Finally, we return to England to outline the links between colonial empire and international war rendered in Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway.  These literary works will be read alongside some of the most important works of postcolonial theory.  While course readings focus on 19th and early 20th century, student's will undertake a research project over the semester in their own period of interest in British literature in connection with empire studies."

This repudiation of rhetorical invention fundamentally shaped modern thought and continues to influence the ways we think and communicate today. In this course, we begin by examining the status of rhetorical invention in the development of modern thought before focusing on various scholarly efforts to revive a rhetorical understanding of invention from the mid-twentieth century forward, surveying a variety of contemporary theories of rhetorical invention including those promoted by postmodern, posthuman, and digital rhetorics.

This view of legal discourse is disputed by critics who point out the figurative aspects of legal language, the importance of character, emotion, and narrative in legal discourse, and the ways in which law protects social structures of power such as race, class, and gender privilege. In this course we examine the often fraught relationship between rhetoric and law by considering the ways in which a variety of legal discourses constitute identities in global contexts, particularly the ways in which legal systems are portrayed to reflect the ideals of democracy to suit particular foreign relations goals. We begin by studying the ways in which Cold War politics influenced desegregation and civil rights discourse in the United States, then we study the ways in which the prosecutions of deposed rulers have been orchestrated to persuade global audiences that emerging democracies observe the \"rule of law\" in order to garner international support. Alongside primary sources of legal discourse, we will study a selection of interdisciplinary scholarship about the relationship of rhetoric and law."

We are all familiar with the informal discourse analysis involved in paraphrasing the meanings of written texts and conversations, a skill we learn in writing and literature classes and in daily life. Here we ask and answer other questions about why people use language as they do, learning to move from a stretch of speech or writing or signing outward to the linguistic, cognitive, historical, social, psychological, and rhetorical reasons for its form and its function. As we look at resources for text-building we read analyses by others and practice analyses of our own, using as data texts suggested by the class as well the instructor. In the process, we discuss methodological issues involved in collecting texts and systematically describing their contexts (ethnographic participant-observation and other forms of naturalistic inquiry; transcription and \"entextualization;\" legal and ethical issues connected with collecting and using other people's voices) as well as methodological issues that arise in the process of interpreting texts (analytical heuristics; reflexivity; standards of evidence).

Or, as others argue in the name of \"actually existing democracies,\" should we embrace difference as a resource, value conflict and counterpublics as a way to circulate new ideas and identities, and replace the norms of formal rationality with a demand for reasoning, open to the non-elite discourses of narrative and testimony, moral advocacy and emotion? In this course, we will combine this energetic theoretical discussion of the public sphere with a look at the grounded practice of local publics that emerge in workplaces, web forums, grassroots or civic groups, and community think tanks. Since counterpublics and local publics enter the arc of controversy well before the more formal process of writing legislation or policy, we will be asking how they carry out the rhetorical work of creating a public controversy, of framing (or re-framing) problems, and of dealing with social, economic and cultural difference. How do they balance the goals of protest, advocacy, and deliberation? To support your own inquiry into the meaning making process of a local public, you will learn methods for activity analysis and for tracing a social/cognitive negotiation."

The goal of the seminar is for participants to acquire the concepts needed to read the current research/scholarship on argumentation with understanding, to apply that research to the analysis of arguments, and to be positioned to contribute to that research. We will begin with a brief history of the classical Greek writings on logic, rhetoric and dialectic, especially the writings of Aristotle. There are questions from that tradition that endure to this day:  What does it take for a conclusion to be well supported? What criteria should govern acceptance of a conclusion?

The connections between sex, gender, and agency that she articulates are connections that early modern theater-makers, from Shakespeare to Aphra Behn, obsessively revisited as they created some of the most haunting characters of the canon, both tragic and comic. In this course, we will look at shrews, witches, she-devils, ranting widows, aspiring divorcees, sex workers, roaring girls, evil queens, and all sorts of nasty women that would tread the boards in early modern London. At the heart of those theatrical depictions lie strong cultural anxieties surrounding the desire and possibility to fashion, control, and disciplinein other words, to regulate and rule overfemininity in a time period that witnessed the invention of the \"two-sex model\" (Thomas Laqueur) and \"the cultural production of domestic heterosexuality\" (Valerie Traub). How did theatre participate in the invention of early modern femininity? How did performance relate and/or resist the discourses about women deployed in the domains of law, religion, medicine, economy, and politics? How did women of color specifically fare in early modern dramaturgy? And what changed when women were allowed to act and actresses replaced boy actors under the Restoration? To study unruly women in early modern drama, we will read plays by Shakespeare, Elizabeth Cary, John Webster, Thomas Middleton, Thomas Heywood, Thomas Dekker, John Fletcher, Aphra Behn, and others in conversation with contextual materials and theoretical texts from the field of Women's, Gender, and Sexuality studies."

We see this, for example, in the increasing use of narrative in journalism, in the presentation of controversial historical events, in current political debates about immigration reform, and in workplace communication. In these contexts, narratives function as a source of authority and legitimation. To understand this function, we will discuss several key concepts in narrative theory, and then apply them to several case studies. We will look at how immigrant narratives circulating in the United States create stock images of immigrants as a threat; at how politicians use autobiographical narration to claim authority; and at how workplace narratives establish roles, boundaries, and power relations.

What is the non-fiction writer's role, and how does it differ from that of the fiction writer? Where do the two genres overlap? What gives non-fiction writing integrity? What does the term \"creative non-fiction\" mean? How have the form and aims of non-fiction writing - from memoir to essays to long-form journalism - evolved for better and for worse?   We will scrutinize the writing of Eula Bliss, Kate Fagan, Joan Didion, James Baldwin, Jo An Bear, Gary Younge, David Foster Wallace, Umberto Eco, and many others. In addition to critical writing assignments, students will have several opportunities to write their own non-fiction pieces."

Yet as we have all observed, these Rules, Roles and Tools often operate in contradictory ways, even in conflict with one another.  Effective team leaders are able to recognize these contradictions and draw a writing group, a project team, a social organization or a workplace into what is called an \"expansive transformation.\"  That is, to innovate new ways of working together.  In this course, you will learn how to become more effective not only as a team member, but also a project leader, and even group consultant in your college work and workplace.  Looking at films, case studies, research, and your own experience, we will learn how to analyze how teams of all sorts are working, to communicate more effectively across different expectations and values, and to collaboratively innovate new ways of working together.   Your final project will let you document your ability to be a knowledgeable team leader and effective collaborator."

Scholarship in this still-emerging field will include work by Roger Chartier, Michel Foucault, Elizabeth Eisenstein, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel de Certeau, , and the current scholars who appear in one of our key books, \"Interacting with Print: A Multigraph.\"  We'll also read primary texts by Joseph Addison, Jane Austen, Samuel Coleridge, and Wilkie Collins to see how differing modes of print and reading became highly contested cultural and political matters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Other topics include the division between new reading publics and their ways of reading books; important changes in book production, typography, printing methods (hand-press to steam press). Such knowledge of the history of print has become especially crucial in an era of emerging \"new media\" and the field of digital humanities in the university.

We take to the seas with Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim, before we consider W. Somerset Maugham's exploration of sexuality in the tropics in The Painted Veil.

We discuss how to ask questions about the past and develop a one-semester research topic, find appropriate primary and secondary sources, take notes from those sources, and write a paper that answers an original question using skills we have studied. In the Spring 2018 semester, we will use the topic of the history of witchcraft and witch-hunting to focus the class.  Although Western beliefs in witchcraft and \"devil worship\" dated back to antiquity, the 16th and 17th centuries witnessed the \"Great European Witch-Hunt,\" which cost the lives of thousands across Europe and in its American colonies. Ever since, historians have struggled to explain why fears of witchcraft suddenly became so acute in this period.  And although the witch-hunts in early modern Europe and its colonies gradually came to an end, beliefs in witchcraft persist into the modern era and, in many parts of the world today, continue to generate campaigns of popular violence against alleged perpetrators. In this course, we'll examine both primary historical sources and secondary scholarship to explore competing interpretations of this complex historical puzzle.

During this course, we will explore how Europeans re-imagined their world in its transition from the medieval to the modern. Topics to be considered will include the \"renaissance\" of the arts, the problems of religious reform, exploration and colonialism, the rise of science, and the expansion of the state. Through these developments, we will focus on Europeans' changing notions of the human body, the body politic, and the natural world, as well as their re-interpretations of the proper relation between the human and the divine, the individual and the community, and the present and the past."

It begins with an examination of the emergence of nationalist movements during the 19th century, to then explore the darker side of romantic nationalisms as they unfolded into the radical political ideologies such as socialism and fascism of the interwar period. We will ask to what extent these earlier histories continued to subtly influence the social landscapes of post-1945 Central and Eastern Europe, thus complicating the processes of socialist modernization that the communist regimes tried to implement in the region under the close scrutiny of the USSR. The second part of the course will focus on the social and political transformations occurring at distinct moments in the history of the Soviet bloc: the 1950s Stalinization, the 1960s De-Stalinization, the emergence of the more subtle forms of dissent in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, and the revolutions of 1989.

This broad introductory course to general history through the prism of literature and politics aims at appreciating humanism and identity from the distant past on. 1. It discusses the significance of language and speech aptitude as a primordial and universal trait upon which rests the possibility of association and organization. This aptitude has made humans history conscious. 2. It explores some basic facts about the pre-19th century Western tradition of governance and the place of the individual within it, along with the expansion of these European states into the world in the aftermath of the maritime navigation and colonial conquest. An emphasis is placed on the pivotal European movements of the Renaissance and Enlightenment. The first, with its humanism in the 16th century, promoted a sense of identity associated with the language spoken in ones area and the rise from the old medieval notion of suzerainty of the local gentry over local communities to the sovereignty of the monarchy of the area, thereby the nation state. The second, the 18th century Enlightenment, led to reforms and revolutions. These transformations, including the growth of literacy, have significantly marked Europe and subsequently the rest of the world that experienced European domination or influence.

Few events in world history have inspired such fear and awe. However, the Mongol period also ushered in the so-called pax Mongolica, the first period of sustained contact and exchange across Eurasia as people, technologies, arts, biodiversity, and ideas spread throughout the Mongol domains and beyond. Questions to be examined include: Who was Genghis Khan and how did he lead a little known nomadic people to conquer much of the known world? What cultural and technological innovations aided the Mongols rise and conquest? How did Genghis's successors rule their vast, diverse domains? What role did religion play in Mongol Eurasia? Why did a unified Mongol empire fall apart in such a relatively short period of time? And how did the Mongols and their empire help shape the world we live in today?"

        "course_description": "The Vietnam War, the first war to be televised, is one of the most controversial and influential events in the post-World War II history of the United States. A limited advisory role for U. S. troops to help the pro-Western government of South Vietnam fight off a Communist insurgency soon escalated to a full-scale American-led war against North Vietnam.  This provoked widespread domestic protest and resistance to compulsory military service - \"the Draft.\"  Eventually, the strategic basis for U. S. foreign policy in general came into question. The U. S. withdrew combat troops and much financial support in 1973; Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) fell to the North in 1975 as Americans watched from their living rooms. This course covers war in Vietnam from the intervention of the U. S. in the mid-1950s through the fall of Saigon in 1975, with particular emphasis on the last decade, which saw the \"Americanization\" and subsequent \"Vietnamization\" of the war under the administrations of presidents Johnson and Nixon. It examines the military and political aspects of the war, as well as some of the social and cultural consequences in the U. S. as a result."

In recent years, most Latin American nations have seen economic \"growth\" and convene peaceful elections, but enormous inequalities persist and environmental problems loom large. We will try to make sense of this reality via historical analysis. In so doing, we will consider long-standing debates over forms of government, economic models, the rights of citizens, the role of government in social welfare, and environmental sustainability. Course materials include scholarly writing, historical documents, current events, music and film/video. The course is discussion-oriented with minimal lecturing."

Students will move beyond textbooks to explore primary source documents, maps, photographs, biographies and historical testimony. For five weeks in the middle of the semester, students will immerse themselves in an extended role-playing exercise, \"The Struggle for Palestine, 1936,\" an elaborate simulation game linked to Barnard College's \"Reacting to the Past\" program. Students portraying British examiners, specific Arab and Zionist characters and journalists will recreate the activities of the 1936 Royal Commission which came to Palestine to investigate the causes of an Arab rebellion and Arab-Jewish strife. This historical reenactment experience constitutes an exciting pedagogical opportunity for delving deeper into the topic material than regular coursework allows. All the role-playing will take place during regular class time, but students should be aware that they will need to devote outside time for preparation and research. Outstanding attendance is also a requirement. Regular classroom activity resumes at the end of the five weeks. The goal of the course is for students to develop a nuanced understanding of the varying goals and priorities of all the actors in Mandate Palestine.

What is more, while conventional histories of the Arabian  Peninsula focus on political and religious affairs, this course will try  to understand Arabian history on a deeper level by focusing on the  lifeways of the Arabian people, including pastoralism, oasis \"bustan  garden\" agriculture, fishing and pearling, and shifting patterns of  long-distance trade. What is more this course will draw heavily from  material from other disciplines, especially medical sciences, to better  understand patterns of change over time. Finally, this course will examine  to what degree these older patterns of human/landscape interactions are  still valid for the Arabian Peninsula today, which has undergone a  transformation almost unparalleled in world history due to the discovery  natural gas and oil."

This course will explore such issues as whether New York, the nation's quintessential city of immigrants, has been a \"melting pot\" and entry point to the Land of Liberty. Has the city been a place where diverse groups of people from around the world have acculturated and Americanized? Or have immigrants to New York City mainly struggled to find acceptance, maintain their culture and traditions, and gain an economic foothold?"

This course looks at the multiple ways that American life changed in the decades between the two world wars. It assesses social, cultural, political, economic, and technological changes that, in the midst of deprivation and economic uncertainty, ultimately brought \"modernity\" to everyday American life. Relating to the Great Depression itself, students will evaluate varying political approaches to the complex financial and social issues wrought by economic downturn, comparing and contrasting Herbert Hoover's local and regional relief focus with Franklin Roosevelt's massive, federally funded New Deal initiatives. In addition, students will analyze first-person narratives from everyday Americans describing their day-to-day experiences.

Like people of European, Asian, and Latino/Latina descent, Africans were part of the early Great Migrations of people from the Old World to the New.  Unlike other ethnic and nationality groups, however, African people arrived in chains and swiftly acquired the legal status of \"slaves for life.\" Was their enslavement inevitable? Was their  transformation into commodities complete? Were they able to form viable families, communities, and movements to topple the institution of human bondage? Did they find dependable white allies? Did they Africanize American culture, politics, and economics? How did some 500,000 of these African people become free (some significant property holders) before the Civil War? Focusing on the development of African and African American life from the beginning of the colonial era through the late antebellum years, this course will explore these and many other questions in the lives of the earliest generations of African people on American soil. Based upon a variety of assigned texts, primary and secondary sources, and lectures, students will become familiar with a wide range of intellectual debates in African American history; write a series of short analytical essays; and advance their own well-argued and well-documented analyses of major controversies in both popular and scholarly interpretations of early African and African American life in the United States."

What were the social, political and cultural consequences? How has the Cultural Revolution been judged in China and the west, and are their other possible interpretations? This class will explore these questions from a variety of perspectives and sources, including documents, literature, memoir, film, academic writings, visual arts and performing arts."

This almost always requires a process of simplification in which inconvenient details are forgotten or repurposed in the service of national agendas. The \"Tibet Question\" is a telling example. In this class, we investigate the historical relationship between \"China\" and \"Tibet\" from the 13th century through the present, and note the ways advocates on both sides of the \"Tibet Question\" have constructed historical narratives (propaganda) in support of their political positions. We will also discuss the prospects for a political solution and consider the lessons the \"Tibet Question\" may hold for understanding other outstanding \"historical\" disputes."

Economic crisis, impoverishment, rising inequality, environmental degradation, pandemic disease, and militant ethnic, religious, and nationalist movements are just as much a part of the contemporary global landscape as are technological innovation, instantaneous communication, shifts in the global division of labor, the creation of new wealth and knowledge, the promotion and defense of human rights, and the rise of cosmopolitan values and perspectives. This course introduces you to important ways of thinking about globalization and will acquaint you with the kinds of research, evidence, and information upon which these kinds of thinking rely.

After quickly reviewing how ghettos spread throughout early modern Europe, the course will shift its focus to the Americas. We will examine when and how the term \"ghetto\" arrived in the United States, and how the use and application of the term changed before the 1930s. For the majority of the course we will study how \"ghetto\" became associated with black urban neighborhoods, and what role local, state, and federal governments played in forming postwar American ghettos. By the end of the course students should better understand the origins of current urban policy and will be prepared to critique and make arguments about how urban policy is often used as a political tool."

These will include some of our own engagements (e.g., campus activism, volunteering abroad), those of nearby communities (e.g., regional environmental-justice activism), and some that may be more distant from our everyday lives (e.g., Indigenous resurgence).

Awareness of living in this unique period of human history brought new debates among scholars, practitioners, and planners thinking about the critical role of agriculture and development on Earth. How can we conceptualize, hope, and plan for best possible outcomes for a human population that depends on agriculture and development? How has the legacy of the Green Revolution encouraged (or betrayed) public enthusiasm for innovative fixes?

Next, we will examine the shifting focus of surveillance from the late 19th century to the present, as it expanded from immigrants and criminals to include industrial workers, political radicals, civil rights activists (most notably Martin Luther King), the poor, and ultimately, all of us.  Today, anyone who has a cell phone in their pocket, surfs the Internet, keeps up with friends through social networks, makes purchases with a credit card, uses membership cards, travels, or even just spends time in public spaces ought to assume that their movements, purchasing habits, communication metadata, social connections, and Internet browsing histories are being recorded, stored and analyzed for a variety of governmental and commercial purposes.

From the gangsters of the Thirties and the film noir of the Fifties to the more recent vigilante avenger films of Liam Neeson, the film industry has profited from films about crime and its consequences.  How those subjects are portrayed, however, tells us a great deal about larger trends in American history and society.  Every imaginable type of criminal activity has been depicted on screen, as have the legal ramifications of those acts.  But these films raise profound questions.  What is the nature of crime?  What makes a criminal?  Are there circumstances in which crime is justified?  How do socioeconomic conditions affect the consequences?  How fair and impartial is our justice system?  Perhaps most importantly, how do depictions of crime and justice in popular media influence our answers to these questions?  This class will utilize a variety of films to discuss the ways in which popular media portrays the sources of crime, the nature of criminals, the court and prison systems, and particular kinds of criminal acts.  Films to be screened may include such titles as The Ox-Bow Incident, Out of the Past, 12 Angry Men, Young Mr. Lincoln, Brute Force, The Equalizer, Jack Reacher and Minority Report.

        "course_description": "What is the relationship between an individual person and collective memories? How do societies \"remember\"? This course proposes an interdisciplinary approach to the relationship between memory and history. It explores various ways in which societies have mobilized their remembrances of the past for political and economic ends in the present; how and whose memory began to matter in a global 20th century; and how individual testimonies have highlighted the role of body, experience, trauma, and nostalgia for writing new, more inclusive and heterogenous histories.  We will analyze how the politics of memory intermesh at a local and global scale, via a set of case studies that focus on: the use and erasure of the past in post-1945 Western and Central Europe; political violence, civil war, and reconciliation in post-1990 Guatemala; and the role of remembrance and testimony for claims of moral retribution in the aftermaths of colonialism (the Mau Mau in Kenya).  The course is organized as a discussion-based seminar. The requirements include: mandatory attendance, one in-class presentation on a course topic, weekly discussion questions/comments submitted through CMU Box, and two essays based on the class readings (9-10 pages each, double spaced)."

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to social and political aspects of water, using in-depth case studies that draw on a variety of perspectives. Examples of regional water projects we'll study include traditional tank irrigation in South India; international negotiations along the Nile River; and the U.S. Government in negotiation with native activists and fisheries on the Columbia River. In addition to regional variety, readings will explore a variety of themes, for example, water and gender; water and armed conflict; and water and private companies versus public management.  By the end of this course, students should be able to articulate their own answers to these questions: How have global organizations and participants characterized, enacted, and addressed problems of water supply and delivery for those who need it most? How do particular regions reflect global trends in water resource development, and how might these diverge from global trends? How have social and environmental studies in the literature of development come to understand the problem of water?  One set of readings is assigned each week. Students should be prepared to discuss each week's readings in a thoughtful way during class meeting time."

We will explore the ideal of Christian marriage and family and examine how the \"ideal\" compared to the reality on such issues as marriage practices, family, gender roles, and sexuality. We will also explore the fashioning of female and masculine gender norms and the construction of the male and female sense of self over time. In the process, we will examine the larger historiographical issue of the use of gender as a tool of historical analysis."

        "course_description": "Invented in 1839, photography was a form of visual expression that immediately attracted a large public following. Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands. One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children. The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century. This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles \"Teenie\" Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others. Classes include a slide lecture, student presentation, and video segments that introduce a focused selection of images by major photographers in an attempt to understand their intentions, styles, and influences. As available, students will be expected to make one or more visits to photography exhibitions on view in Pittsburgh (locations to be announced at the first class.)"

What does an effective and just response look like when those who are most responsible for climate change are also often the most protected from its consequences?  Who gets to participate in international negotiations and whose cosmologies or values are recognized there?  How do debates about climate change relate to those concerning social policy?  In this mini-course, we will examine these questions through the lens of Climate Justice.  Both a transnational movement and an analytical orientation, Climate Justice compels us to consider how climate change reflects (and exacerbates) systemic inequalities within and between societies.  Our exploration will engage case studies and perspectives from different parts of the world, including climate-related health disparities in the US, Indigenous Peoples' calls for climate reparations, island nations facing displacement, and efforts by various parties to influence scientific and popular knowledge."

At the dawn of the sixteenth century, most western Europeans shared a common religious identity as members of the Roman Catholic Church. Within months of the publication of the 95 Theses, this consensus began to crumble, and the very fabric of western culture was irrevocably altered. By 1550, Europe was splintered into various conflicting churches, sects, and factions, each with its own set of truths and its own plan for reforming the church and society at large. Although the Reformation gave rise to Protestantism, it also encompassed a simultaneous movement for renewal and reform within Roman Catholicism. This course will survey the Reformations of the sixteenth century, both Protestant and Catholic, examining the causes of the Reformation, the dynamics of reform, and its significance for western society and culture. In the process, we will analyze such on-going problems as religious persecution and the accommodation of dissent, the relationship between religion and politics, and the interactions between ideology and political, social, and economic factors in the process of historical change."

Some ghettos lasted for only a short period before they were destroyed; some lasted for years. Most were placed in towns or cities, but others were in rural areas. Some were designed as labor camps, and in a few, families and communities did manage to survive the war. This course will focus on the East European ghettos, examining how they emerged, their function in the Nazi system, and their development from areas of spatial segregation to killing zones aimed at the annihilation of the people they contained. The course will examine Jewish life within the ghettos, social and cultural gaps, the Judenrat (Jewish councils appointed by the Nazis), and Jewish alternative leadership.  We will also look at the uprising within the Warsaw ghetto, which resulted in its total destruction. By analyzing the development of the Ghetto as an urban disaster zone, we will seek to comprehend changes in the concept of ghettos by their inhabitants and by the oppressors.  Using a case study approach, we will focus on the Warsaw Ghetto as a blockade within the surrounding city, the Lodz Ghetto as labor camp, the Mogilev and Zhmerinka ghettos (which remained relatively open under Romanian occupation but were part of a program of ethnic cleansing), and the ghettos in Vilnius and Bialystok, each of which raised horrific dilemmas of leadership among the imprisoned Jewish population."

In this great and untried experiment, they initially attempted to remake every phase of human life, from the family to art to education.  Before Stalin's rise to power at the end of the 1920s, the new socialist society challenged tradition and posed new possibilities.  How could life be lived in a new way and better way?  What values could and should replace the old traditions of patriarchy and elitism?  How could ordinary people be empowered to create a new culture?  In this course, we will study the 1920s, a riotous decade of experimentation in cultural, sexual, and political life.  Looking at literature, art, social relations, education, and law, we will examine the theories and experiments that bloomed in the wake of revolution."

        "course_description": "Observation, participation and direct experience of \"the field\" are hallmarks of anthropological ways of knowing, and their representation has played a foundational role in ethnographic writing both past and present. Yet reflexive and postmodernist explorations of these topics have triggered contentious debates over the nature of anthropology as a scientific or humanistic enterprise, and over its ethical, political and epistemological value. In this seminar, we will approach such questions through an exploration of the extremes of ethnographic fieldwork and writing. We will consider such topics as: the colonial history and politics of explorers and ethnographers; liminality and the place of extreme experience&#8212;such as cultural dislocation, violence, derangement, intoxication, sex, possession, and dreaming-in fieldwork and writing; field-notes as an ethnographic genre, and their relationship to \"official\" published ethnography; ethnographic surrealism and surrealist ethnography; the dimensions of sensory experience (visual, auditory, olfactory, etc.) in fieldwork and ethnography; collecting and the powers of \"exotic\" objects; inter-subjectivity and its implications; and experimentation with alternate ethnographic forms, such as autobiography, film, diary, and poetry."

Entrepreneurs must play an important role in developing the African continent, because both African governments and foreign aid have overall failed. In the face of these myriad of internal and external constraints on economic development, the history of entrepreneurship and future potential for entrepreneurship is often overlooked. This course will show that sub-Saharan Africa is-and has been for centuries-a thriving place of business, despite the obstacles of war, political and economic instability, disease, and famine. It will also focus on the challenges, such as local, regional, and national integration, access to credit and capital accumulation, and debt burden that African economies faced in the past, present, and future. Lastly, it will focus on the strategies that entrepreneurs in Africa-local and foreign-have developed to circumnavigate these challenges-and the opportunities that they have created in spite of them. By taking a historical approach to the subjects of entrepreneurship, innovation, and technology in Africa, this course will define African entrepreneurship in a way that is rooted in Africans' historical experiences and use this definition to put Africa's current and future roles in the global economy into historical perspective."

At the same time, the U.S. defense establishment continued its pursuit of advanced technologies in all facets and at all levels of warfare, evolving through various regional interventions and culminating in the Gulf War, \"Operation Desert Storm,\" in 1991.  We will examine the continuing and increasing role of hi-tech in the chaotic decade after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and in the American-led \"War on Terror\" since 9/11, waged by a much smaller, highly professionalized military, and we will engage some ethical and social issues about the American Way of War in the recent past and the citizens who practice it."

        "course_description": "Science is an ever-changing enterprise.  Most scientific advances, though significant, occur within a stable framework of accepted theories and data. A few episodes of change in the history of science involve discarding and replacing fundamental theories of the world.  These are often accompanied by significant changes in the vocabulary in which those theories are expressed, the tools used by scientists, the phenomena on which scientists focus, and the kinds of explanations they consider acceptable.  A very small number of these episodes change the way humanity views its ability to know the natural world and its place in universe. The latter two kinds of change in science have often been called \"scientific revolutions.\"  We will focus on four such radical transformations: The \"Copernican Revolution\" (or \"the Scientific Revolution\") of the 16th and 17th centuries, the Darwinian revolution of the 19th century, the quantum revolution of the late 19th and 20th centuries, and Einstein's revolution in the science of space and time of the 20th century. This course has two intertwined components: history of science and philosophy of science. In the historical component, we will examine in some detail the four major scientific revolutions. The philosophical components will help us understanding the reasoning involved in scientific theory change. This course does not required detailed knowledge of any of the sciences used in examples of revolutionary change."

The purpose of this course is to help prepare you for these negotiations. In particular, in this course, you will reflect on your current approaches to conflict, study the nature of conflict and why it tends to escalate, and develop your own skills for principled negotiation. Throughout the course you will also participate in negotiation simulations exercising your powers of communication and persuasion while practicing conflict resolution tactics. My goal is that you finish this course a more reflective and effective negotiator, better prepared to handle the conflicts you will inevitably face."

This new approach led to new puzzles and paradoxes, along with a focus on the age old question of what can be known and what is meaningful. The modern fields of linguistics, cognitive science, and information and computer sciences all owe a debt to these sources, as does of course contemporary philosophy.

Peirce responded by constructing a comprehensive philosophy emphasizing the scientific importance of community, fallibility, and action. Pragmatism was also developed and vigorously popularized by William James, who aspired to be a painter and ended up as an acknowledged founder of modern empirical psychology. James extended Peirce's position by defending the role of values in even the purest of empirical sciences. John Dewey, who is also well-known for his role in education, interpreted science as an evolving social system and developed a theory of aesthetics based on what we now call the psychology of problem solving. The pragmatists made and continue to make lasting contributions to modern statistics, logic, and social science and their emphases on community, fallibility, action, and value in science are still of primary importance in philosophy and in the ongoing dialogue between the scientific and humanistic cultures."

By the juxtaposition of such objects (phonemes or graphemes), larger symbolic objects are created (morphemes). Morphemes have the special property that they can be associated in a consistent way with meanings. In a progressive fashion, words are built from morphemes, phrases from words, and sentences from phrases. Sentences have different moods, and these moods correspond to their function with respect to the encoding and transmission of information. Indicative sentences carry information, interrogative sentences request information, imperative sentences demand action, conditional and modal sentences present alternative possibilities, and so on. The goal of this course is to investigate the structure of the linguistic entities by which these communicative functions are realized.

Some, like Tolkien's Elvish languages, Okrand's Klingon, and Peterson's Dothaki and Trigedasleng have been designed for artistic or entertainment purposes: they have set out to be \"natural\" languages within fictional worlds. Others, like Zamenhof's Esperanto, Brown's Loglan, and Elgin's L&#225;adan have tried to address perceived inadequacies of the natural languages that their creators saw in the world around them. The of study language invention is thus both the study of a distinctive art form, and an exploration of the history of how people have thought about language in different ages and societies.

Do all aspects of syntax manipulate the same kinds of structural units, or do different grammatical processes rest on incompatible notions of constituency?

To the extent that there is mismatch between different notions of syntactic structure, how can it be reconciled within a theory of grammar? These questions are engaged in through the diagnostics and techniques of modern syntactic analysis and argumentation.

We begin by presenting (predicate) logic and strategic ways of constructing proofs; that is extended to a systematic development of elementary set theory and the formal representability of (informal) mathematics in set theory.  With this basis, it is possible to show that set theory is incomplete.  To show that logic is undecidable, a concept of computation is introduced via Turing machines. The three concepts - proof, set, computation - are fundamental, in particular, for mathematics and computer science. The undecidability and incompleteness results are among the most significant contributions of modern logic; they provide also the beginnings of a deeper understanding of mental processes in cognitive science and, thus, of the human mind.

        "course_description": "Mathematics is a central part of our intellectual experience. It is connected to sophisticated philosophical perspectives, say, in the work of Plato, Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, as well as in contemporary analytic philosophy; it is equally connected to fundamental views in the sciences, say, in the work of Ptolemy, Galileo, Newton, Einstein, as well as in contemporary cosmology.  The common view that mathematics - if not directly \"static\", it evolves in a linear fashion - does not withstand historical scrutiny. Indeed, there are many dramatic conceptual developments concerning the very nature and object of mathematics.  We examine three episodes in the relatively recent past that reflect a radical transformation of the subject. They are closely associated with three mathematicians in whose work those revolutionary changes come to the fore most poignantly.  The three episodes are framed by a discussion, at the beginning, of the axiomatic method and, at the end, of contemporary computational models of mathematical thinking. The episodes fall within the period from 1854 to 1954, but have deep roots in the past. The first episode deals with the shift from geometry to arithmetic as the foundational discipline for mathematics. The accompanying change in the methodological perspective is expressed in Hilbert's Foundations of Geometry, the center of the second episode. When joined with contemporaneous logical developments, that perspective underlies the formalization of mathematics. G&#246;del's incompleteness theorems imposed theoretical limits on that work.  However, given Turing's analysis of computations, the question remains, how much of mathematical reasoning can be accomplished by computing machines. Completing a full circle, we incorporate central features of the axiomatic method into computational models of mathematical thinking."

After discussing links between non-monotonic reasoning and probability, the second half of the course will focus on current attempts to combine logic and probability/statistics for AI applications, including Markov Logic, probabilistic programming approaches, and several others. We will highlight the logical aspects of these tools, and more generally discuss the role logic can play in modern AI. Philosophical issues in AI will also be discussed.  Prerequisites: Background in both logic and artificial intelligence would be useful. However, a solid background in one but not the other should also be fine.

We also consider topological semantics as an alternative to relational semantics, and investigate the connection between the two. Finally, we introduce modal predicate logic, incorporating first-order quantification into the system. In the latter part of the course we turn our attention to more specialized logical systems and their applications, as determined by the interests of the class. Topics may include: epistemic and doxastic logics, multi-agent systems and the notion of common knowledge (with applications to game theory), deontic logics, logics for reasoning about counterfactuals, temporal and dynamic logics, public announcement logic, justification logic, and others.Some mathematical experience/maturity (e.g., 15251 or 21127 or 80211 or 80210 or 80212), or permission of the instructor."

The course begins with the meanings of words and examines how these meanings combine to give the meanings of sentences, based on the notion of truth conditions for indicative sentences. That notion of meaning is then extended to sentences in other moods, and to sentences that do not simply describe how the world is, including sentences which are modal, conditional, or simply fictional.  Semantics is a subject that can be developed in a highly formal way, but here it will be presented to make it accessible to students with varied backgrounds and interests.

We will focus primarily on consonants and the phonetic principles that govern their realization, with a special emphasis on voicing.  We will learn about how articulatory and acoustic principles give rise to voicing assimilation, final devoicing and the interaction of consonant voicing and tone. The exploration will be hands on, and we will learn how to measure voice onset time, analyze stop bursts and fricative noise and see how the voicing of a consonant affects the pitch of the following vowel, using Praat.   On the phonological side, we will consider various ways in which voicing contrasts and processes have been represented, including SPE-style binary features, feature geometry and Optimality Theory.  One of the central themes will be how to reconcile phonological accounts of voicing phenomena with our understanding of their underlying phonetic principles.  Both rule-based and constraint-based approaches to phonology rely on discrete symbols, whether they be phones or features, but the speech stream is not neatly divided into segment-sized units, and the features of phonological theory are typically spread over multiple segments.  Additionally, many phonological explanations recapitulate phonetic principles, calling into question what we consider to be an explanation of sound patterns.  The course will culminate in a survey of some recent approaches to understanding how phonetics and phonology interact."

Such categorical models occur, for example, in denotational semantics. e.g. treating the ambda-calculus via the theory of cartesian closed categories. Higher-order logic is treated categorically by the theory of topoi. In particular we will cover the notion of \"realizability topos\", which is a category theoretic incarnation of the realizability technique from proof theory.  A prerequesite for this course if familiarity with basic category theory (as treated e.g. in Steve Awodey's \"Category Theory\" textbook), but depending on demand the course can start with a quick refresher of the central concepts."

Topics to include: Arrow's impossibility theorem, consensus, and Savage's position in \u00a77.2 &amp; \u00a713.5 of his book.     2.3. Contemporary theories that highlight violations of the sure-thing principle &#8212; violations of Savage's postulate P2. 3. For the third part, we discuss issues related to Indeterministic and/or Imprecise Probability [IP] theory.  The seminar explores some of the ongoing research programs falling under IP, mostly as reflected in the Society for Imprecise Probability: Theories and Applications (www.sipta.org)."

In HoTT we think of types as spaces, dependent types as fibrations, and of the identity types as path spaces. We will see that many spaces that are familiar to topologists can be represented as higher inductive types, and we will develop the basic theorems and constructions in HoTT to reason about them."

The broad topics of the course will be:  1. How to use various kinds of graphs for representation of probabilities, causal models, actual causation, and counterfactuals 2. How to use graphs to answer questions about conditional probabilities, the effects of manipulations, and counterfactuals.  3. Assumptions relating probabilities to causation."

        "course_description": "Claims that certain things are incommensurable are common in several areas of philosophical discourse.  In the philosophy of science, for example, it has been claimed that different scientific theories, or particular claims or terms within these theories, are incommensurable.  In ethics, some have argued that different types of values (rights, utility, personal commitments, individual identities) are incommensurable.  In many cases, incommensurability is treated as a problem that needs to be surmounted in order for agents to make rational decisions to compare alternative theories or to evaluate acts or policies that implicate different kinds of value.  The first part of this course examines what incommensurability is supposed to be, how it supposedly arises in various fields, and what kind of challenge it poses for theories of rationality and rational choice.  In the second part of the course we examine theories in which incommensurability is not a problem to be overcome, but a kind of moral requirement in itself.  For instance, the injunction at the heart of Kantian ethics not to treat agents (with dignity) like things (with a price) requires that these entities not be brought into certain kinds of comparative relationship.  Similar claims seem to be at work in certain liberal political theories (Walzer and Rawls), in views that seek to limit the scope of goods that can be distributed in markets, and in views of science that treat conceptual diversity as an source of important social benefit.  A goal of the course is to show how a variety of issues across diverse philosophical contexts have a common structure and how formal work in social choice (e.g., Arrovian impossibility results), and decision theory (e.g., theories of choice that relax the ordering assumption) can help to clarify and resolve important problems."

The model (or models) we will develop will be informed by the effects of coherence constraints in linguistic interpretation and in cognition. In the linguistic realm, interpretation typically involves constructing representations that are richer than the content that is linguistically encoded, and this enrichment is plausibly the result, in part, of the expectation of coherence. This expectation has far reaching effects, including on the assignment of referents to pronouns, the interpretation of definite and indefinite noun phrases, assignment of temporal relations, and the identification of Gricean conversational implicatures. In the cognitive realm, coherence is widely recognized as a factor in various learning &amp; reasoning processes, including conceptual integration, belief adjustment, sequential decision-making, and even less rational processes such as rationalization.     In the first part of the seminar, we will develop an understanding of the linguistic and cognitive phenomena relating to coherence in its many manifestations. In the mid-part of the seminar, students will present models and frameworks of coherence from other fields, and examine ways to model various linguistic and cognitive phenomena using these approaches. In the concluding section of the seminar, we will focus on particular linguistic/cognitive phenomena and try to modify the various models to (hopefully) find characterizations and explanations of the diverse phenomena."

The United Nations even recognizes language as integral to maintaining the cultural heritage of communities and peoples around the world, and the freedom to choose ones language of expression as a universal human right.   In this course, we will explore a variety of questions, advantages, and challenges related to language diversity and cultural identity across the globe. Our main focus will be on contexts of multilingualismthat is, contexts in which two or more languages may be used. Adopting a comparative case study approach, we will explore the following themes: (i) The historical underpinnings of language diversity and its consequences for cultural identity today (e.g., migration, colonization, conquest); (ii) How language diversity and cultural identity shapes, and is shaped by, local, regional, national, and international politics; (iii) The relationship between language diversity and language use and visibility in public spaces (i.e., the linguistic landscape); (iv) Relations between linguistic communities (e.g., majority and minority language users) and the sense of belonging to a culture.

The following questions will motivate discussion: What is Chinese culture in the modern world? What is \"modern\" and what \"traditional\" Chinese culture? How does high culture interact with folk culture and popular culture? How have education and language policies shaped Chinese cultural identities over the last century? What does it mean to be Chinese in a diaspora context? Secondary readings, primary documents, and video material chosen for analysis will provide students with important insights into the diverse factors that have been shaping contemporary Chinese culture. This course is conducted in English with no requirement of prior knowledge of Chinese language for students who take it for 9 units. Students who take this course towards fulfillment of requirements for the Chinese major or minor must register for 12 units requiring completion of three (3) units of study in Chinese Studies.

This course will explore Latin American culture and language, focusing on issues of cultural identity. Tracing the historical thread of the construction of Latin American cultural identity we will distinguish 6 periods organized around crisis when the topic of Who we are? becomes a central debate (Larrain 1996).  These periods include: the conquest and colonization, the independence and constitution of nation-states, the inter war period and the depression, the 1970s and the military dictatorships and the present globalization stage. These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larrain 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. There are three main questions we will be exploring throughout the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?; How does Latin America think of itself?; What does Latin America want to be?. These questions will be explored historically through readings of philosophical and political texts that deal with Latin American identity as well as with literary texts, films and music that represent practices that enact this/ese identity/ies.

What constitutes a (super)hero? Which cultural values does this type of character promote? What kinds of political societies do they appear in, and how do issues of gender, race, and ethnicity play out in these comics? In order to answer these questions, the course delves into a selection of popular comic books and graphic novels from the Spanish-speaking world, and provides the skills for reading these works critically as cultural artifacts in terms of what they depict and how they do so. We will also use these comics to develop a historical and theoretical exploration of Spanish, Latin American, and Latinx popular culture, narrative, history, and society. Analytic methods include hands-on instruction in Comic Book Markup Language, or CBML, as one of the tools to encode and analyze the structural, textual, visual, and bibliographic complexity of these comics as documents combining pictorial and textual elements.  Expectations include diligent reading, active participation, written responses, creative and analytical writing, and a final project that involves encoding of texts in CBML.

The purpose of this course is to explore Hispanic culture and history through contemporary films in Spanish.  Undoubtedly, films are a rich source of meaningful cultural information that can provide the audience with an understanding of a countrys culture (history, politics, social problems, etc.) through their discussion and analysis.  Movies not only represent reality, but they do it from a particular position. The images produced in films are charged with political interests that reproduce or challenge established beliefs and views. Films offer different representations of reality as well as different ways of relating to it (Achugar, 2008).  We will view and analyze a selected group of films portraying four main issues in Hispanic history and society: memory and oblivion, immigration and exile, marginalized identities throughout history, and the Hispanic world in globalization.  An understanding of the socio-political context that these films aim to portray through in-depth reading, analysis, discussion, and investigation will provide a thorough understanding of the complexities of various historic events, and opportunities and challenges faced by the Hispanic world.  Throughout the semester, we will practice the four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) as we continue to build on vocabulary and review grammar points based on the films viewed, the texts read, and the topics discussed.

We will study the above topics via newspaper articles and media coverage, short video clips, as well as theoretical and fictional texts. Overall, the course will provide you with a good overview of some of the most important topics that French people are concerned about, which probably played a role in the 2017 presidential election. More importantly, these topics are at the core of the current and future preoccupations of Western democratic societies, in particular in the European Union, the most ambitious political project of the modern era.

Spring 2018: This course will examine the impact of the terrorist attacks that have rocked the French capital since 2015. From Montrouge and Charlie, to the Bataclan, to the August 2017 Levallois-Perret vehicle ramming, Paris has been hit with the deadliest attacks on its soil since WWII. As we analyze the literary, artistic, policy and public response to these tragic events, both in France and abroad, we will investigate the ways in which these waves of terror have impacted the local and global perception of the City of Light.   Readings will include Eric Vuillard's 14 Juillet, Cristian Lejal&#233;'s Paris, 13 Novembre 2015 and Julien Suaudau's Dawa (the author will visit our class). The course will also examine the filmic representations of the attacks' aftermath in Rachel Palumbo's Violentes R&#233;jouissances and Nicholas Boukhrief's Made in France. Students will have the opportunity to attend a symposium on race and religion in France, co-organized by Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.  Good reading skills in French and a good ability to express oneself both orally and in writing are essential. In line with the spirit of these explorations, you are encouraged to use a variety of media for your presentation."

        "course_description": "Vienna 1900 was many things: the political center of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; the center of German-language music and theater; the birthplace of Zionism and of psychoanalysis;  the home of cafe culture and the waltz; the city of baroque urban palaces and squalid backyard tenements; and the showcase for historicism. And while the story of Vienna's cultural and political turmoil is interesting, it probably would not command our attention today were it not for its role as the birthplace of Modernism.   The class explores Vienna before the collapse of the Austro- Hungarian Empire in 1918. We will be looking at a huge and at times confusing canvas, which by necessity includes almost every aspect of culture. From history and politics we will move on through art, architecture, psychoanalysis, literature, music, and philosophy. We will be looking at art nouveau buildings and furniture, reading literature, viewing films, and listening to recordings.  Using an enhanced historical map of the city as a digital interface and an interactive learning tool, we will add a crucial visual component to the course and research the connections between urban and architectural space and the intellectual activity that took place in it. You will work in teams with students from other disciplines. You will research networks of intellectual and artistic activities and create 3D models of the spaces, from public squares to cafe interiors, in which these intellectual activities took place. You will create and expand a growing collection of records, photos, archival materials, as well as artwork, music and other media in an effort to reconstruct the dialogue among the arts and the cultural debate of this key moment in the passage to Modernism. No previous knowledge of 3D modeling software is required, software instruction and tutoring will be provided. The language of instruction is English with a German credit option"

This course will explore what happened to German culture from 1933 to 1945. In particular, it will examine the Nazi assault on modern (or \"degenerate\") art and the artistic response of the German and foreign resistance to Nazi tyranny. Arts explored will include literature, film, music, and the visual arts. We will read from the works of a variety of writers, including \u00d6d&#246;n von Horvath, Anna Seghers, Bertolt Brecht, Adolf Hitler, Albert Speer, Hanns Johst, Paul Celan, and Wilfrid Bade.

It moves from the silent cinema of the 1910s to the Weimar Republic, when German cinema represented Hollywood's greatest challenger in the international cinema world.  It then addresses the cinema of Hitler's so-called \"Third Reich,\" when German cinema dominated European movie theaters, and moves on to the cinema of divided Germany from 1949-1989, when cinema in the socialist east and cinema in the capitalist west developed in very different ways.  In the final week of the semester, the course will address German cinema in the post-unification period, which has experienced a revival in popularity and interest.  The two historical foci of the semester will be the Weimar Republic, the classic era of German cinema, and the era of the so-called \"New German Cinema\" of the 1970s and 1980s, when major German directors developed radical new approaches to cinema and critiques of Hollywood.  Among the great directors focused on in the course of the semester will be Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, Fritz Lang, Leni Riefenstahl, Wolfgang Staudte, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder.  No knowledge of the German language is required for this course. Most of the films will be in German with English subtitles.  The course will be cross-listed in the departments of Modern Languages, English, and History.

In this course, we will explore the Spanish body through the lens of medical humanities and disability studies. The former includes texts created in medical environments and from medical experiences, written by doctors, patients and members of the community. Spain has a rich history of doctor/authors that can provide some level of insight into the narrative of the Spanish medical community. Disability studies, on the other hand, views the body in a non-medical context. Instead of proposing the abnormal body as a medical phenomenon to be studied in a petri dish, these expression of (corpo)reality trace ideas of normalcy as societal constructs. The theme of disability in Spain comes in to play with the wealth of organizations dedicated to disability rights (while also mired in controversy).   The texts will come in the form of advocacy pamphlets, novels written by doctors, fictional (and non) depictions of the medical field, illness, etc., painting and sculpture, and films. This course will prompt us to pay attention to the objectification and abjectification of these bodies and consider that through this awareness must also come understanding the body as a text - not an object - but a text that warrants intricate observation. We will analyze these texts in an effort to understanding the constructions of normalcy. In the end, our analysis will be used to create our own texts."

The military-civilian dictatorships of the 1970s in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay were a period of State terrorism. This violent period resulted in thousands of disappeared people, political prisoners and exiles. These experiences have had a lasting impact in the new democracies. There is still a debate over how to address violations of human rights and how to make sense of the past, so that these events don't happen again. There has been a rich production of movies focusing on this historical period that serves as a document of how the struggles over how to come to terms with a traumatic past have been dealt with by different countries. These films also provide a glimpse of how popular culture serves as a vehicle to construct a social memory of recent history. Through films new generations that did not experience these traumatic events learns about what happened and what it means for particular social actors. We will analyze films from Argentina, Chile and Uruguay in order to better understand how these countries have dealt with a contested past.

The course invites active and critical participation in the exploration of Japanese language and culture through pragmatics, as well as other closely related issues including intercultural communication, sociolinguistic variation, and linguistic ideology."

The course provides an experiential component that allows students to use their second language and culture skills while acquiring or honing their research skills. CBR helps bridge the gap between university and community life to facilitate the development of life-long learning habits and humanistic citizenship. ML students and faculty will jointly design and execute ways in which to 'give back' to the community being studied, which will be chosen based upon the language, culture and/or history of a specific community. Students in this course may participate in historical, ethnographic and cultural research; ethnographic fieldwork; problem solving activities around a particular issue the community is facing; discover how to best identify a particular linguistic/cultural community and document, interpret, preserve and disseminate its history and culture. Class activities may include group, pair and independent reading and research; group and pair travel; group, pair and one-on-one interaction with community members; public presentations; photography, filming, scanning; webpage and document design; and different kinds of writing.

While the existence of this so-called \"reality\" and its ultimate discovery are still very much in question, there are indeed some forms, in which China is presented or represented in a much less embellished, dramatized, stereotyped, albeit no less complex and intriguing way. By way of watching, analyzing and discussing a variety of documentary films and TV shows made with a documentary touch, this course encourages students to develop in-depth knowledge of modern Chinese society and culture in the closest proximity to its bare \"reality.\" The course will use a thematic approach to cover different social and cultural issues that China is facing nowadays, including the harmony/conflicts between human and nature, the social/economic gap between city and countryside, the rise of the second generation of the nouveau riche, a humanitarian tale from the AIDS village, the life of foreigners in Chinese society, and so on. Secondary readings in English and Chinese about these social and cultural issues will be provided. All classroom discussions and course projects will be given or conducted in Chinese and/or English.

By examining African women and their relationship to this process, we will also see the alternative frames of feminisms and knowledges that emerge from these realities. The core questions driving this course are: (i) what are the various development ideologies and processes that have shaped contemporary Africa? (ii) How have African women adopted, rejected, and/or creolized these ideologies and processes for the purposes of changing their cultural, political, and economic conditions?

We will explore the socio-economic and political issues that developing nations face and take special care to practice perspective taking (i.e. we will put ourselves in specific nations' shoes and consider situations from their point of view). We will adopt various lenses (e.g. post colonialism, liberalism, feminism) throughout the semester to inform our understanding of the various positions taken by global actors. By addressing the unequal power balance between developed and developing nations as well as among developing nations, we will enrich our world view and understanding of major global issues, such as development. We will practice those skills in class through discussions and activities (you should expect very little lecturing) and outside of class through guided readings.

This course will cover three major areas. First, we will evaluate the strategic incentives faced by all leaders and discuss how these incentives differ by regime type.  Second, we will discuss how leader responses to these incentives shape policy outcomes such as economic growth. Third, we will examine the factors that promote transitions from one regime type to another. Throughout the course, students will be asked to re-consider much of what they've thought about both democratic and non-democratic leaders. Class assignments will ask students to critically examine existing theories of political organization and apply their knowledge to real world cases, both historical and contemporary."

        "course_description": "Conflict and revolution are usually associated with armed struggle and violence. But over the course of the last century, nonviolent conflict has become an increasingly prominent source of institutional change and political revolution around the world, from Gandhi's salt march to Filipino \"people power\" to the post-Soviet \"color revolutions\" to the Arab Spring. What are the causes, strategies, tactics, dynamics, and consequences of nonviolent conflict, and how do these differ from violent or armed conflict? When and how do unarmed \"people power\" campaigns topple repressive authoritarian regimes? This course addresses these questions and in the process engages contending theories of power, revolution, and insurgency. The first half of the course introduces students to key concepts, theories, and historical patterns of nonviolent conflict. In the second half of the course, the class analyzes case studies of landmark nonviolent campaigns, both successful and failed. By the end, students will be expected to write an original 10 page analysis of a particular historical nonviolent conflict, or an intelligence estimate that assesses the prospects for the onset or outcome of nonviolent conflict in a contemporary country."

Study then turns to an overview of legal research skills.  Though usually the province of law students and attorneys, such skills will enable students to know when policy may be crafted \"from scratch\" &#8212; or where, when, and how policy must conform to larger governing legal or regulatory structures.  Students will then consider a particular sub-specie of public policy, administrative law, which addresses the special circumstance of regulatory agencies and the statutory regimes that create and govern them.  The course culminates with students developing and \"staffing\" a notional policy, modeled on the federal agency policy system studied throughout the term.

Legislative-executive relations have an impact on the judiciary. Senate confirmation of the president's Supreme Court nominees is one vivid example. As the only nationally elected official in the US, the president also has a bully pulpit- the unique opportunity among all government officials to engage with the American public.  Using analytical perspectives and theories from the discipline of political science, this course takes a close look at the US presidency. It investigates what it takes to get elected and what the president does that is distinct among all government officials, domestic and international. It also examines the relationship between the president and US society. At the end of the semester, students will have a deep understanding of the US presidency and will be ready for further study of the office and US government.

Students will be challenged to consider how the 2009 introduction of cyberspace as a warfighting domain- in addition to land, maritime, air, and space- affects the ways that scholars and practitioners- operating with force structures and strategic, operational, and tactical concepts that are decades, if not centuries old- conceive of and practice warfare in the 21st Century.  The principle objective of this course is to introduce students to cyber war within the context of traditional, and emerging, concepts of armed and unarmed warfare.

This method is used to study patterns and changes in problem-solving and their matches to theoretical models, including computational models.      Corpus Analysis.  This method is used to isolate patterns of behavioral and communication usage and change, as revealed through the study of the world-wide web and large computerized databases such as CHILDES, TalkBank, or the British National Corpus.  Tools here include text searches and data-mining.      Conversation Analysis. This is a microanalytic method used to examine sequencing, repair, and orientation in closely transcribed recordings of spoken interactions, as made available through systems such as the CABank database, as well as recorded programs on YouTube and elsewhere.      Coding Systems.  This approach seeks to capture interactional and behavioral structures in writing, teaching, interview, and other interactions.  Here, there will be a special emphasis on the coding of instructional interactions.      Gesture Analysis.  This microanalytic method seeks to track patterns in gestural and nonverbal communication, often in association with spoken messages.      Profile Analysis. This approach studies differences across learners at various ages and ability levels and group differences involving aphasia, autism, stuttering, dementia, and other individual differences.    Students will work with data already available from previous studies, and will also learn to collect their own new datasets.  Although the data being examined have been generated through naturalistic processes, they can be analyzed quantitatively using time-series analyses, non-parametric statistics, error matrices, and neural network simulations.   In these various analyses, we will also consider how behavioral patterns are shape"

You communicate to get information that will be the basis of decisions, to provide a vision for the people who work for and with you, to coordinate activity, and to sell yourself and your work. The goal of this course is to identify sources of communication problems within an organization and ways to overcome them. To do this requires that we know how communication normally works, what parts are difficult, and how to fix it when it goes wrong. The focus of this course is on providing you with a broad understanding of the way communication operates within dyads, work groups, and organizations. This course is not a practicum in public speaking or writing, although you will get some experience writing, speaking, and managing impressions. Rather the intent is to give you theoretical and empirical underpinnings for the communication you will undoubtedly do when you return to work. Readings come from both the research and the managerial literatures. Among the topics considered are managerial communication, persuasion and conformity, self presentation and person perception, social networks. Cases and group projects give you an opportunity to apply what you've learned."

After a brief discussion about the structural and systemic origins of the racial status quo, we will examine the way that individuals navigate the social and racial landscape of modern-day America. Complementing courses that take sociological approaches to race in America, this course will focus on how individuals' perceptions and thoughts about the world affect how they interpret and respond to social situations.  For example, the course will address: how stereotypes about one's race or identity can cause individuals to feel threatened, and can undermine health, feelings of belonging, and academic performance  how an individual's concerns about the thoughts and beliefs of others can radically affect identity formation, particularly during adolescence how individuals have to navigate multiple cultural identities, especially as minority group members contending with mainstream ideas that differ from their own how majority group members (e.g., Whites) view their role in racial systems, and how they deal with concerns about being or appearing prejudiced   how interventions can use social psychological concepts to mitigate negative outcomes of racial inequality  We will then use our understanding of these concepts to examine and consider different racial situations thoughout American society and to understand how individuals navigate and experience race and identity. Throughout the course, we will watch films, read literature, and analyze music and art that reflect the experience of race and identity."

This method is used to isolate patterns of behavioral and communication usage and change, as revealed through the study of the world-wide web and large computerized databases such as CHILDES, TalkBank, or the British National Corpus.  Tools here include text searches and data-mining.      Conversation Analysis. This is a microanalytic method used to examine sequencing, repair, and orientation in closely transcribed recordings of spoken interactions, as made available through systems such as the CABank database, as well as recorded programs on YouTube and elsewhere.      Coding Systems.  This approach seeks to capture interactional and behavioral structures in writing, teaching, interview, and other interactions.  Here, there will be a special emphasis on the coding of instructional interactions.      Gesture Analysis.  This microanalytic method seeks to track patterns in gestural and nonverbal communication, often in association with spoken messages.      Profile Analysis. This approach studies differences across learners at various ages and ability levels and group differences involving aphasia, autism, stuttering, dementia, and other individual differences.    Students will work with data already available from previous studies, and will also learn to collect their own new datasets.  Although the data being examined have been generated through naturalistic processes, they can be analyzed quantitatively using time-series analyses, non-parametric statistics, error matrices, and neural network simulations.   In these various analyses, we will also consider how behavioral patterns are shape"

What is intelligence and how does it vary across individuals and over our lifespans?  What are we good at, and what are we bad at, and why?  Are there things that that make us dumber?   Are there things we can do to make ourselves smarter?  How should what we know about the range of human intellectual abilities guide policy, education, law, medicine, and business; what implications does this have regarding the tasks/jobs that humans should be doing and the tasks/jobs that machines ought to do?

This course focuses on the scientific problem of analyzing causal hypotheses in real-world settings, not on the mathematical details of regression.  After clearly distinguishing prediction from causation, we discuss how to represent causal hypotheses and how to use regressions to analyze both predictive and causal hypotheses.     Using in-class data exercises throughout, we will examine how to move from an interesting but somewhat vague question about the world (e.g., do police discriminate based on race and gender, do NFL athletes choke under high pressure, does parenthood improve happiness) to a clear statistical model that, when estimated, meaningfully addresses the question asked.  The course emphasizes causal analysis as the main research goal and multivariate linear regression as the main statistical tool.  After mastering basic techniques, we will introduce students to more advanced econometric approaches such as panel regressions and instrumental variables to deal with trickier settings in which causal inference is more challenging (e.g., do more guns lead to more violence?).    In keeping with the hands-on philosophy of the course, a central focus of the semester will be a group research paper/presentation where students will have the opportunity to formulate and empirically test a research question of their choosing.  Students will learn how to find, clean, and analyze a new dataset, and then concisely communicate their findings in the form of a scientific paper (and accompanying presentation).  The research project makes this course excellent preparation for any student who hopes to ultimately write an undergraduate thesis."

Where do our ideas come from, and how can we measure the consequences of their conjecture, spread, and evolution? How can we design systems to make us better thinkers? In this introduction to the \"big data\" study of human behavior, we'll learn some key concepts and simple computational tools for studying how people gain and share information, with a focus on what they say and write. And we'll apply these tools to social behaviors from the writing of Harry Potter fan fiction to online trolling, to science, markets, and liberal democracy itself. The class will include conceptual, computational, and data-driven investigations; students in social science, humanities, engineering and the sciences are equally welcome. At the end of this course, students will be able to build models for how people think and talk to each other, to see how thinking and talking work in both the past and present, and to imagine, and even design, systems that might help us think, and talk, together more effectively in the future.

We will cross traditional disciplinary boundaries and venture into economics, political science, sociology, finance, cognitive science, computer science, physics, statistics, and mathematics as needed.    Students will be expected to think critically about how to apply modeling insights to the real world, taking account of the social, political, and economic implications of proposed policies. They will express their ideas in class discussions, presentations, and written reports. The course will culminate with students engaging in a research project to model a complex social system of their choice."

Public policy is the study of the written and unwritten principles on which law is based. Laws and regulations translate policy into action. Public policy and laws form the basis of health policy. Health policy is supported by: - Public health initiatives focused on preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health for the entire population. (i.e. diabetes awareness) - Population health is interested in the outcomes of individual groups and the distribution of outcomes among the groups. (i.e. income equality and infant mortality) - Healthcare delivery is focused on access, quality and cost. At this time in our history, Healthcare Reform best embodies the intent of this aspect of health policy.  Through the use of group assignments, students will create a model which links external environment into healthcare delivery profitability. Modeling is a form of combining individual technical components with the greater knowledge and conceptualization of the entire process. Its promise is to promote better decision making by envisioning how micro decisions interconnect to mission, goals and outcomes.

This introduction to the basics of sabermetrics will explain concepts including normalization, peak versus career performance, linear weights and runs created, as well as popular calculations like OPS (On\u00adBase plus Slugging), WHIP (Walks and Hits per Inning Pitched), PF (Park Factor) and others increasingly used by members of the sabermetrics community."

We hope to use these robots as an introduction to the world of hobbyists for any student who would find making \"something that they can fly\" fun.  It is not hard to learn to build a quadrotor, it is just a matter of being taught. We would love for students in fields such as \"fine arts\" or \"business\" to take this course, and we have designed it to be understood by a nontechnical audience, but to be enjoyed by everyone. Take our StuCo and harass your roommate by flying at them with your very own quadrotor that YOU built."

Students will make their own characters, play as those characters in adventurers with their peers, and will eventually design their own encounters and run their own games as Dungeon Masters. While we would recommend students purchasing the 4e Rulebooks for this class, all relevant references can be made using the D&amp;D wiki which we will provide a link to in the course. NOTICE: Students will be charged $3 for a set of dice, unless students have their own dice sets. The students keep the dice sets after the course."

From early times, civilizations with the most advanced materials have dominated the history of warfare and have been responsible for the infrastructural developments that have cradled out societies. As a result, materials have been influential in the trade and commerce between societies and are still to this day, strongly involved in the political, economic and social conflicts worldwide.    Materials do not stand alone in development however, they are a result of, or are influenced by, technological needs and developments. The more advanced the material, the more energy and effort is required for its' production. In the US, the production of materials accounts for about 90% of the country's energy usage. This fact clearly indicates a strong tie between materials and energy, and without energy, technological developments based on material advancement will not occur.    In our world today, the need to provide improved performance, economics and design in consumer goods comes as a direct result of the market conditions established by consumers. Material selection and design therefore is driven by application and consumer needs which implies that the consumer has a large influence on material consumption. Material selection and material usage in turn have major ecological  implications in energy, material resources and direct environmental impact. Awareness of the complicated interaction is paramount for continued development of civilization. With the scale of industrialization that exists on our planet, consideration of  resource management, ethical material selection choices, energy management, and final disposal are all necessary to ensure a sustainable future."

Some of the more specific questions we address: Because humans possess free will and act with intentions while light rays and planets in motion do not, are we forced to use logically different species of explanations in the two cases? How can we explain social institutions that depend upon cooperation? Whereas natural scientists actively conduct experiments, social scientists can often only collect statistical data.

        "course_description": "Decisions we make every day may range from simple and routine to novel and highly complex. For example, decisions while driving (judging the distance to the front car, the speed, the directions, and making choices accordingly) seem effortless and routine after some experience, while triaging patients in an emergency room under scarce resources may be quite overwhelming for everyone. Both types of decisions however, have something in common: they are made in the presence of change and in the absence of explicit information of probabilities, possible alternatives, and outcomes. Our decisions in such situations are the result from the interaction between the dynamic environmental demands and our cognitive processes. In this course you will learn how decisions are made in different dynamic situations and how our cognitive processes (e.g., attention, experience, risk tendencies, and other factors) influence the way those decisions are made. Students will be introduced to different aspects of decision processes by analyzing the sources of error in complex problems, such as cases of accidents and disasters (natural or man-made), in multiple disciplines (e.g., aviation, management, military strategy, and others).  The course will also use simulation-based representations of dynamic decision making situations (e.g., microworlds) to illustrate relevant cognitive processes needed for learning, adaptation and choice. Finally, students will learn how to construct mathematical/computational models of dynamic systems, be able to interpret simulation results and to explore scenarios regarding effects of variables in the models and the predictions that the models can make."

These laws are applied to deduce relationships among heat capacities and other measureable quantities and then are generalized to open systems and their various auxiliary thermodynamic potentials; transformations between potentials are developed. Criteria for equilibrium of multicomponent systems are developed and applied to phase transformations and chemical reactions. Models of solutions are obtained by using statistical mechanics and are applied to deduce simple phase diagrams for ideal and regular solutions.

We approach the topic through case studies, beginning with the religious conflicts and settlement between church and state during the French revolution, Evangelical Christian participation in the anti-slavery movement in Britain, Protestant-Catholic rivalries in Germany, the power of the papacy in Italy, and the Dreyfus case in France.

We will begin by surveying important factors governing the Earth's climate including solar and terrestrial radiative equilibrium and ocean heat storage and transport.  Next, we will discuss the several perturbations or \"forcings\" that industrial society has imposed on Earth's climate: changes in greenhouse gas concentrations, ozone, and aerosols. The course will examine how complex climate feedbacks lead to significant uncertainty regarding the response of the Earth to these forcings. Decision-making strategies that policy makers can use to deal with these uncertainties will be discussed.  We will outline major impacts of climate change on society as well as natural systems and strategies for mitigating climate change."

Our course will put these and other controversies surrounding the politics of representation in the arts into broader historical and artistic contexts.

We will begin by discussing the issue of criminalization and whether the expansion of the criminal law is or is not problematic.  From there, we will turn to the more foundational questions of what, precisely, the law is, and what its connection to morality is or should be.  Are we obligated to obey the law, and if so, why?  Finally, we will ask whether it is possible for the law to remain neutral with regards to morality and politics, and whether the supposed \"neutrality\" of the law may itself be an instrument of oppression.  If the legal system lacks the kind of neutrality that many legal theorists claim for it, what (if anything) does that license us (as citizens) to do?"

The main theoretical tools are spatial models of political decision-making, and models of collective action problems.  The position taken in this course is that understanding American philosophical ideas about authority, power, and freedom is as central to demystifying the U.S. form of democracy as is understanding how decision-making institutions function.  Thus, on one side, this course looks at how American political thought is infused into political institutions and society.  On the other side, it investigates institutional arrangements using rationalistic theories.  In addition, scientific writings at the intersection of psychology and economics are used to probe the possibility of gaining explanatory leverage on U.S. politics from the perspective of behavioral decision-making theories."

This impulse resulted in ten amendments to the Constitution, which we have come to know as the Bill of Rights.   The very first (and arguably considered at the time as the most essential) of these was the First Amendment, which we sometimes call the \"free speech\" amendment to the Constitution.

        "course_description": "Is it possible to convey messages that remain comprehensible after immense time, in the face of inevitable cultural shifts and physical decay? In this course, students will come to terms with the technical and philosophical aspects to this problem while working on group projects to propose solutions to the preservation of memory. Along the way, we will identify the challenges in extracting meaning from artifacts, both ancient and contemporary, such as documents and monuments, whether intentional or unintentional. We will also confront ethical and esthetic issues in identifying what is worth preserving, the challenge of societal pressures on past projects, the possibility of future indifference, and the question of what purpose this endeavor may serve for present-day humanity. Case studies will include time capsules such as those created by the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company for the 1939 and 1964 New York World's Fairs; the proposed warning marker system for the U.S. Department of Energy Waste Isolation Pilot Plant; the Voyager Golden Records launched aboard two interplanetary probes; and attempts at communication with extraterrestrial intelligence."
