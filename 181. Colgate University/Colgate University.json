The goal is to introduce students to a major world area with which many, even highly educated, Westerners are unfamiliar. Africa is the original home of the human species, and the intellectual contributions of the continent and its people to the concept of a common humanity are tremendous, including agricultural and industrial technologies, artistic and aesthetic principles, and religious and philosophical ideas. Due to early patterns of globalization and European colonization in the western hemisphere, the Atlantic slave trade, and ultimately colonialism on the continent itself, Africa was configured as \u201cthe Dark Continent\u201d in European discourses of the nineteenth century.",

Composed of 55 member states, the African Union was constituted in 2000 as the successor to the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Its objectives are to achieve continental integration, similar to that of the European Union, in balance with recognizing the national sovereignty of its member states. The Model African Union is in session for four days in late February, hosted by Howard University in Washington D.C., and students from more than 30 colleges and universities around the country participate. The on-campus portion of the course meets weekly for the five weeks prior to the trip and one week after, for debriefing. Students are assigned to specific country delegations and committees, research and prepare position papers, draft resolutions, debate and vote on action items, and generally take on the roles of African diplomats. The trip includes a visit to the embassy of the country each delegation is representing. May be taken more than once, with different country and committee assignments each year.",

Combining both philosophical and experiential perspectives, coursework raises questions including what science is, in what ways Chinese medicine is science, and how these questions disrupt the single narrative of science. By means of these topics, the larger goal is to explore and discover methods of broadening our field of vision and diversifying our viewpoints in dealing with the issue of exclusion in academia and in life itself. There are no prerequisites, and students with knowledge of Chinese language are also encouraged to enroll.",

Furthermore, the word \"Maya\" serves as an umbrella term that refers to a number of diverse populations, each with distinct culture, language, and material culture. This course will focus on both the construction of the pan-Maya identity, and the numerous populations included within the concept, such as the Tzel Tal, Tzotzil, Kaqchikel, K'iche', Chantal, and the Lacandon, just to name a few. Each of these groups has distinct histories, which often demonstrated significant clashes with colonial and modem national hegemonies. This course also highlights how tradition, language, and identity are preserved under the forces of colonial and nationalistic domination and will also delve into the subject of changing traditions, as these Maya movements of resistance have integrated social media, rock music, and hip-hop to engage younger generations. Ultimately, the Maya provide a means of deconstructing the concept of identity itself by demonstrating how shared identities are constructed, contested, and negotiated.",

It is a country of extremes. This course offers an interdisciplinary inquiry into this ecologically and culturally diverse land. The course begins by exploring the distinct geography and ecology of the central Andean region (rainforest, mountains, desert, and ocean) in order to understand how these features have shaped the societies that inhabit the region of present-day Peru. This involves analyzing the evolution and organization of Pre-Columbian societies, paying special attention to the Inca civilization. It also examines the ideologies, institutions and practices introduced with the Spanish conquest and era of colonialism in order to understand their impact on indigenous society and their relevance to the state of underdevelopment that characterizes contemporary Peru. Study of present-day Peru juxtaposes rural and urban life, the ties between the two spheres, and the crisis conditions that enveloped both ways of life until recently. Specific issues include the internal armed conflict, shantytowns and land invasions, and indigenous resistance, among other compelling issues. Throughout the term, this course emphasizes the many paradoxes of this intriguing land.",

However, earlier processes were already under way before the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet in the 1950s, which made the transition from a constellation of feudal polities to a nation possible. These included a common written language, common subsistence patterns (farming, pastoralism, and trade), Buddhism, participation in common rituals and festivals (especially religious pilgrimage), a certain respect for the authority of the Dalai Lamas, and so on. Students examine these processes as well as the consequences of China's political and economic incorporation of Tibetan areas into its nascent nation-state. Specific topics to be explored include \"the Tibet Problem\" (i.e. contemporary Sino-Tibetan relations and conflict), the historic colonial and religious ties between China Proper and Tibet, religious life and everyday Tibetans, \"nomadism\" (or pastoralism), polyandry and women in Tibet, and Tibetans' encounter with modernity and the West.",

They are mutable and ephemeral, yet they pack enormous physical and spiritual power; they are visible, but not tangible for humans; they prompt considerations of the human relation to the broader natural world. They are alluring objects of scientific investigation, creative imagination, and psychological projection. Clouds can unleash profound devastation or provide the sustaining waters of life, and they mediate ideas as varied as transience and transcendence,\nobfuscation and revelation, delight and despair. In this multidisciplinary and inter-divisional senior seminar, students explore the phenomenon of clouds and the fascination they hold across time and cultures from a variety of overlapping modes of inquiry, from the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities and various genres in the creative arts. Applications to the seminar are welcome from seniors eligible for Core Distinction.\n\nCatalog description: \nThe goal of the distinction seminar is to complement honors work in departments and programs by giving select students the opportunity to reflect on the broader, interdisciplinary contexts of their honors projects. Through readings assigned by the seminar instructors, students explore the methodologies of their own and other disciplines. Each student writes a substantial interdisciplinary paper relevant to the student\u2019s departmental honors work. This requirement may be satisfied in one of the following ways: 1) by extending a departmental honors project to explore interdisciplinary perspectives on the project topic or to examine the social implications or historical foundations of the project; 2) by self-consciously considering the generation and evaluation of knowledge in the major; or 3) by collaborating with one or more members of the seminar to explore themes common to the students\u2019 departmental projects. To enroll in the distinction seminar, students must achieve a 3.33 (B+) or better GPA in the five Core components: Legacies of the Ancient World, Challenges of Modernity, Scientific Perspectives on the World, Communities and Identities, and Global Engagements. For students who repeat or complete multiple courses with a Common Core component, only the grade in the first course is considered. A cumulative grade for all Global Engagements courses completed is averaged in the Core GPA. To earn Distinction in the Liberal Arts Core, students must earn an A- or better in the distinction seminar and achieve an overall GPA of 3.33 or better at the time of graduation.\n",

Among the questions the course asks are: How does trauma shape imagination and open up access to the site of disaster that is now carried in fragments which inform memory? How do representations of violence shape and inflect aesthetic orientations and literary and artistic forms? The course concerns itself with the aftermath of two 20th-century genocides--that of the Armenians in Turkey during World War I and of the Jews in Europe during World War II--both seminal events of the 20th century that, in various ways, became models for ensuing genocides.",

Some scholars even believe that the \u201chunting instinct\u201d is a fundamental aspect of human identity. People in modern industrialized societies, however, often have little idea about the origins of the flesh they consume, most of which is raised and slaughtered on an industrial-scale. While the majority continue to eat meat, poultry, and/or fish, a minority have chosen to become vegetarians or even vegans for ethical, religious, cultural, health-oriented, or environmental reasons. Others continue to hunt and fish but within ecosystems dramatically altered by human intervention and amidst cultural landscapes complicated by commercialized and trophy hunting.  Drawing upon a wide range of sources including literature, artistic and documentary films, works of popular culture, autobiographical accounts, online hunting (and anti-hunting) forums, diverse web resources, self-reflective essays, and scholarly approaches ranging from animal studies to humanistic ecocriticism, this course investigates the intertwined themes of hunting, industrial versus small-scale farming and fishing, eating, vegetarianism, and the ethical and existential choices they present to members of modern industrialized societies.",

Finding it difficult to organize labor, the colonial authorities used forced labor with no or little compensation and, since independence modern forms of slavery are still practiced in many parts of the continent.

The war of 1948 is analyzed in light of decolonization struggles following WWII, just as the \"Six-Day War\" of 1967 is studied in light of Cold War politics. In addition to focusing on flashpoints in the history of the conflict, the course also examines international agendas for ending it. Repeated US efforts to broker a peace are analyzed in light of geopolitical developments elsewhere. Students will become well-versed in the historical and social developments of the conflict and study the various treaties, armistice agreements, and memoranda that have guided efforts to bring it to a conclusion. They also study outstanding issues in the contest between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as current peace and armistice proposals.",

Asymmetric warfare, however, is no mere historical artifact. It dominates headlines as much as it confounds leaders around the world. Central to this course are several in depth case studies of counter-insurgency and terrorism, including France in Algeria and Indochina; the British in Malaya, East Africa and Northern Ireland; state terrorism in Latin America during the Cold War; and the United States in the Philippines, Vietnam, and, after September 11, 2001, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. The evolution of non-state terrorism \u2014 from the violent acts of Anarchists in the late 19th Century to the potentially apocalyptic terrorism of radical religious groups the early 21st Century \u2014 also comes under scrutiny. From Clausewitz to General Petraeus, from Mao Zedong to Ayman Al-Zawahiri, this class explores how asymmetric war is lived and understood by various observers and participants.",

Students will explore those contradictions by connecting war mobilization and security politics to the trajectory of American political development and state/society relations over time. Topics include: the role of the putatively weak American state in shaping 19th century territorial expansion; the effect of wartime mobilization and participation on racial politics; the interplay of warfare and the welfare state in American history; the postwar politics of the \"military-industrial complex;\" and the impact of foreign policy and national security on the American party system.

In addition to focusing on flashpoints in the history of the conflict, the course also examines international agendas for ending it. Repeated US efforts to broker a peace are analyzed in light of geopolitical developments elsewhere. Students will become well-versed in the historical and social developments of the conflict and study the various treaties, armistice agreements, and memoranda that have guided efforts to bring it to a conclusion.

How do representations of violence shape and inflect aesthetic orientations and literary and artistic forms? The course concerns itself with the aftermath of two 20th-century genocides--that of the Armenians in Turkey during World War I and of the Jews in Europe during World War II--both seminal events of the 20th century that, in various ways, became models for ensuing genocides.",

In this seminar, students explore what uncertainty is and how a rational person ought to cope with it. Students investigate how philosophers represent uncertainty, what states of being uncertain are rational and irrational, and how uncertainty interacts with traditional concepts of philosophical study, like evidence, belief, knowledge, and action. Students also gain experience at using logic and probability to understand philosophical issues, while probing the limits of such systematization.",

Bd. of Education, along with their more recent conservative corollaries, are solely the product of adherence to constitutional standards of interpretation. Instead, it posits that these controversial rulings and judicial policy in general can be explained through careful examination of certain political factors. In short, the course is based on the premise that the judiciary is a permeable structure that is responsive to democratic processes and that, in turn, exerts influence upon those processes.

The course examines the ways in which the events leading up to war, wartime conditions, and eyewitness accounts were recorded and internalized by citizens and managed by an autocratic state to create collective historical understandings of events. By analyzing the changing ways in which social hierarchy, gender and exclusivity have been structured during and in the aftermath of war, the course offers an important guide to understanding the emergence of ethno-nationalism in one of the world's largest and longest\u00adlasting multi-ethnic Empires.",

How does a researcher decide what counts as evidence, for example, and draw rational and compelling inferences from that data? How does the researcher then decide on the voice and formal conventions to use when communicating these inferences to the intended audience? Students explore these questions by engaging in critical analysis of research texts in order to articulate a rhetorical framework for research writing within a chosen field. Using this framework, students craft a research process and produce writing, critically reflecting on their own processes and writing at each step to understand the need to approach research as a rhetorical praxis.",

How do cultural logics, values, and assumptions hierarchically govern different geo-political spaces? In what ways have individuals and groups both conformed to and resisted discursive structures of power and privilege? And finally, in what ways can comparative and intercultural study sharpen our own critical insights about and rhetorical agency within such dominant structures?

The flawed and paradoxical inventions of photography gave rise to an experimental period during which photographers, while they knew that a photograph could be made, did not fully understand why it happened. Demands for artistry occasioned hand-work on the image, printing a single photograph from multiple negatives, experimenting with focus, hand-colouring of images, etc. Instead of seeing these as bungling transgressions of some photographic essence, we should view them instead as experimental works of art. The latest and most useful ways of approaching historical photographs are introduced.",

In this section, readings focus on questions about the natural order and diverse approaches to it in some of the literatures of the ancient world. In particular, students study the emergence of an explicit concept of nature in ancient Greek literature (Greek physis, translated into Latin as natura), its revolutionary transformations in antiquity, and its legacy in the modern world. Some of the questions considered are: What is \u201cnature\u201d? Is it compatible with the divine? How are numbers related to \u201cnature\u201d? What is the relationship between human \u201cnature\u201d and \u201cnature\u201d as a whole, and between culture and \u201cnature\u201d? Finally, is the legacy of the ancient conceptions of nature one worth celebrating? \n\nCatalog Description:\nExplores ancient texts that articulate perennial issues, such as the nature of the human and the divine; virtue and the good life; the true, the just, and the beautiful; the difference between subjective opinion and objective knowledge. These texts exemplify basic modes of speech, literary forms, and patterns of thinking that establish the terminology of academic and intellectual discourse and critical thought across many different societies: epic, rhetoric, tragedy, poetry, epistemology, science, democracy, rationality, the soul, spirit, law, grace. Such terms have shaped the patterns of life, norms, and prejudices that human communities have continually challenged, criticized, and refashioned throughout history. To highlight both the dialogue and conflicts between the texts and the traditions they embody, this course, taught by a multidisciplinary staff and in an interdisciplinary manner, focuses on both the historical contexts of these texts and the ongoing retellings and reinterpretations of them through time. The course includes texts from the ancient Mediterranean world that have given rise to some of the philosophical, political, religious, and artistic traditions associated with \u201cThe West,\u201d emphasizing that Western traditions were not formed in a vacuum but developed in dialogue and conflict with other traditions. Common to all sections of this component are classic works such as Homer, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, Plato, and a Roman text. Complementary texts or visual materials from the ancient period, in and beyond the Western world, and/or response texts from the medieval or contemporary periods are added by faculty in individual sections.",

As this process is examined, students also explore the relationship between cells and developmental patterns, and investigate how genetic and environmental factors can influence (and alter) cell fate.

These texts exemplify basic modes of speech, literary forms, and patterns of thinking that establish the terminology of academic and intellectual discourse and critical thought across many different societies: epic, rhetoric, tragedy, poetry, epistemology, science, democracy, rationality, the soul, spirit, law, grace. Such terms have shaped the patterns of life, norms, and prejudices that human communities have continually challenged, criticized, and refashioned throughout history. To highlight both the dialogue and conflicts between the texts and the traditions they embody, this course, taught by a multidisciplinary staff and in an interdisciplinary manner, focuses on both the historical contexts of these texts and the ongoing retellings and reinterpretations of them through time. The course includes texts from the ancient Mediterranean world that have given rise to some of the philosophical, political, religious, and artistic traditions associated with \u201cThe West,\u201d emphasizing that Western traditions were not formed in a vacuum but developed in dialogue and conflict with other traditions. Common to all sections of this component are classic works such as Homer, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, Plato, and a Roman text.

A matrix of intellectual, social, and material forces that have transformed the world over the last quarter millennium, modernity has introduced new problems and possibilities into human life. Within modernity, issues of meaning, identity, and morality have been critiqued in distinctive ways. People of different social classes, racial groups, ethnic backgrounds, genders and sexual identities have contributed to an increasingly rich public discourse. The human psyche has been problematized, and the dynamic character of the world, both natural and social, has been explored. Urbanization and technological development have transformed the patterns of everyday life. Imperialism has had a complex and lasting impact on the entire globe. The human capability to ameliorate social and physical ills has increased exponentially, and yet so has the human capacity for mass destruction and exploitation. In this course, taught by an interdisciplinary staff, students explore texts from a variety of media that engage with the ideas and phenomena central to modernity. To ensure a substantially common experience for students, the staff each year chooses texts to be taught in all sections of the course. This component of the Core Curriculum encourages students to think broadly and critically about the world that they inhabit, asking them to see their contemporary concerns in the perspective of the long-standing discourses of modernity.",

It evaluates the international frame of environmental justice from a human rights perspective and its applicability to different case studies. A close examination of the theoretical North-South relationship, in terms of dependency and exploitation of peripheral (South) countries by core (North) countries, is central to the course. It analyzes a constellation of issues labeled as global environmental justice, such as tribal exterminations, dislocations of marginalized communities, and resource conflicts. Real world examples of environmental justice cases are critically assessed to develop an understanding of the complex relationships among actors that lead to environmental injustices.",

Students also explore how Black revolutions migrate in political imaginations to inspire other movements for freedom. Recognizing the value of understanding complex diasporic lenses that include race, gender, sexuality, immigration status, and class, students are introduced to diasporic encounters and experiences of African descendants, the formation of transnational social movements, black internationalism, Pan-Africanism, post-1965 immigration, and contemporary Black life. To this end, coursework challenges and expands students\u2019 understandings of the diverse and complex history of people of the African Diaspora, what it means to be Black in the 21st Century, and how cultural exchanges have informed contemporary Black life in addition to migration, colonialism, slavery, and the quest for political enfranchisement.Students who successfully complete this seminar receive credit for CORE C148 and satisfy the Core Communities requirement.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is endangering Ukrainian cultural heritage, with historic structures being targeted for destruction, and entire cities leveled. The April 2019 fire at Notre Dame cathedral in Paris generated a vigorous debate about how (and how fast) to respond to the loss of historic architectural heritage. Local stakeholders are working together with international agencies to assess and rebuild damaged heritage in Syria and Iraq. The 2004 reconstruction of the sixteenth-century Mostar Bridge aimed to heal the religious divisions of the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the Second World War, inhabitants of Warsaw had to decide on which image of their city to revive in reconstruction activities. Students study these case studies and others, to consider the destruction, reconstruction, and preservation of architectural heritage. Students discuss religious iconoclasm, revolution, tactical destruction and cultural cleansing, monuments and memorialization, architectural reconstruction and \u201cfacadism,\u201d looting/art theft, accident and natural disaster; the politics of representation will also figure prominently.

Britain was now a world power, at the center of a far-flung empire, and competing with France for dominance in Europe and beyond.

Attention also is given to evolutionary changes in the neural structures implicated in human language and to neural processes constraining the developmental course of language acquisition.",

But geopolitics is more than an academic field. Geopolitical thought has actually instructed states how to relate to one another in the contest for territory, security, and resources. For example, the history of geopolitical analysis is closely connected to -- and has often justified -- various imperial projects. As a result, this course examines the relation between the development of geopolitical thought on one hand, and geopolitical events on the other. Of particular importance to the relation between theories of geopolitics and the actual geostrategies of states has been the development of conflict on a planetary scale. And so, this course traces that relation through the study of geopolitical thought and practice in the course of imperial struggles in the 19th century, World Wars and the threat of nuclear wars in the 20th, and new global challenges such as resource wars and environmental security in our own time.",

Over the last decade, various conflicts subsided enough for some states to institute political and market reforms. Others remained stuck in the throes of economic stagnation, on the verge of disintegration and vulnerable to terrorist groups and drug runners who exploit their vast ungovernable territories. What explains the various transitions that some states have experienced in sub-Saharan Africa? Why did most states disintegrate in violence following the end of colonial rule? Drawing upon pre-colonial accounts and histories of state formation and the theoretical, methodological, and conceptual tools that various Africanists have used to analyze key events, this course offers answers to these and other important questions about political and socio-economic developments on the continent of Africa.",

The analysis of plays, poetry, works of art, and other texts of the 16th and 17th centuries reveals how the Conquest and its aftermath were reimagined by Spanish and Creole subjects, enabling them to articulate new forms of power, authority and hybrid identity.",

This is a course about time, about the art of rhetoric as a most effective medium of change at the right time. Students see this when rhetoric served as a vehicle for change in 5th-century Greece, when it equipped individuals to write and preach to effect change in the so-called dark ages, and when it gave women and former slaves the voice to change attitudes and institutions in the 19th and 20th centuries. Students survey the entire history of western rhetoric from the earliest treatises to the most recent theories. In addition to examining this history through a close reading of canonical texts, students come to know the rhetorical tradition through experience, by engaging in the very practices (e.g., medieval preaching and letter writing, and 18th-century exercises in elocution) associated with rhetoric in a particular historical period.

Civil war, Jim Crow, Civil Rights, and Black Power were all actions or movements that ensued largely because words fell short of persuading persons of good will to submit to reasoned arguments. Arguably a pillar of American democracy (as in the freedom to speak and to dissent), why has rhetoric been so seemingly ineffective in securing mutual respect and understanding between America's Black and White citizens? This course seeks to answer this question by closely examining the styles of communication that historically have shaped the cultural identities and public personas of the two groups. From slave speech to the languages of protest in the 1960s to verbal expression in rap music and social media today, the course considers why communication or dialogue involving race is often doomed to fail.",

As this process is examined, students also explore the relationship between cells and developmental patterns, and investigate how genetic and environmental factors can influence (and alter) cell fate. Biological, social, and ethical aspects of the human manipulation of development are also considered, including examination of such topics as cloning by nuclear transfer, reproductive technology, fetal surgery, stem cells, and embryonic gene therapy.",

French is the official language but most Martinicans freely express themselves in Creole. The majority of Martinicans will declare that they are, first and foremost, citizens of the French Republic, but will also readily admit that they are Martinican by culture. What is striking about Martinique is the dizzying array of cultural signifiers that seem to coexist in a veritable braided community, in which it can be genuinely difficult to tell where one cultural identity strand ends and another begins. Martinique is thus a fabulous lens through which this process of negotiating and renegotiating of cultures, languages, and identities can be viewed, and can be considered a precursor to modern-day globalization.",

Not only do smaller-scale conflicts (\"violent peacetime\") often continue after the end of formal hostilities, but the stress of war produces social, political, economic, intellectual, and psychological disruptions that can last for years, if not generations, after the fighting stops. Students examine these consequences from a comparative perspective, including in its compass the aftermaths of the Napoleonic Wars, the U.S. Civil War, both World Wars, and the War of Yugoslav Succession. Is \"postwar\" a useful category of historical analysis, and if so, what can it tell us about the countries and cultures that have experienced it in the modern era?",

Today the very fabric of life is threatened and the future of our world hangs in the balance as nature is threatened by destruction caused by an environmental crisis that has gone unchecked for several centuries.

The death of Franco in 1975 brought a cultural regeneration to the country, which was renowned for its literary innovation and fresh relationship to a new sociocultural context, especially for female writers and female representation. This course analyzes themes of oppression and social injustice from a gender perspective in the literary works of post-war novelists, as well as the novelistic representations of women undergone by Spain during the transition to democracy.",

Students focus on black foodways by exploring the historical, political, and cultural significance of soul food to the black community. Soul food is one part of a larger universe of dishes such as collard greens, corn bread, potato salad, gumbo, barbeque, fried catfish, black-eyed peas, and chicken bog, to name a few. Soul food tells a story of how black folks endured slavery and carry the traditions and history of that time into the present. Much more than physical sustenance, soul food is an object of meaning-making, inseparable from the cultural frameworks in which it is enmeshed. The practices of making and eating soul food are foundational to the black community\u2019s survival. What people eat, how they eat, and who is doing the food preparation is every bit as much symbolic as it is rooted in biological survival. Ultimately food is an object of historical and philosophical inquiry.

With a particular attention to the effects of U.S., Spanish, and Japanese imperialism across the Pacific, and to Indigenous demands for place-making amidst military and tourist projects imposed from outside, students examine the competing geographic ideas and political struggles that make place and meaning in the region. As Pacific Islanders continue to migrate within and beyond the Pacific Islands, such movements and flows prompt the questions: What, and where, is the Pacific?

Students begin by exploring the distinct geography and ecology of the central Andean region (rainforest, mountains, desert, and ocean) in order to understand how these features have shaped the societies that inhabit the region of present-day Peru. This involves analyzing the evolution and organization of Pre-Columbian societies, paying special attention to the Inca civilization. Students also examine the ideologies, institutions and practices introduced with the Spanish conquest and era of colonialism in order to understand their impact on indigenous society and their relevance to the state of underdevelopment that characterizes contemporary Peru. Special emphasis is placed on analyzing the diverse social, historical and cultural manifestations of Afro- and Asian-Peruvian communities, which have had a determining influence on the fabric of what today is called the Peruvian identity. Study of present-day Peru juxtaposes rural and urban life, the ties between the two spheres, and the crisis conditions that enveloped both ways of life until recently. Specific issues include the internal armed conflict, shantytowns and land invasions, indigenous and Afro-Peruvian resistance, among other compelling issues.

        "course_description": "Where are we? What are we made of? How do we know? These are fundamental questions in science. Students explore these questions via several topics of much research in science today. Students look at fundamental questions at the cosmological scale, like the big bang, the structure of the universe, birth and death of stars, and the nature of black holes; and then inward to fundamental questions in the subatomic world, made up of baryons, mesons, leptons, and quarks. The exercise shows that the properties of elementary particles and their interactions are intimately tied to the cosmological questions. The discussion centers on what we know about these topics and how we investigate them. An important component of this course is the discussion of the outstanding puzzles today, like dark matter in the universe, the missing energy fueling its expansion, and whether certain fundamental particles exist or not. In exploring these questions the course provides an introductory coverage of the major physical theories: Newtonian mechanics, quantum mechanics, and relativity. How do these questions affect society and humanity? Students also examine some of the current controversies and debates.",

In humans, repeated divisions of this single fertilized egg are responsible for the production of more than 70 trillion cells of greater than 200 different types. Students examine how a fertilized egg undergoes division, how the stem cells produced by these divisions become \"determined\" to form cells of particular types, and how these determined cells finally differentiate into the highly specialized cells that make up most tissues and organs. As this process is examined, students also explore the relationship between cells and developmental patterns, and investigate how genetic and environmental factors can influence (and alter) cell fate. Biological, social, and ethical aspects of the human manipulation of development are also considered, including examination of such topics as cloning by nuclear transfer, reproductive technology, fetal surgery, stem cells, and embryonic gene therapy.",

Students survey different methods of conducting elections and voting. This gives tools to assess the fairness of our election methods in this country and how they might make policy decisions related to elections and voting. These policies concern both the ways of casting our votes (voting technology) and the election methods. One part of the course compares different ways of electing candidates and the mathematical theory behind these methods. Methods to be considered include plurality (candidate with the most votes wins), different run-off methods, and other methods. It also looks at the two-stage process for the US presidential elections where in the second stage, states vote using a weighted vote (the Electoral College). The second part of the course considers different ways that votes can be cast. This includes the history of different methods of voting and their vulnerability to fraud. This will lead to current debates about voting technology: How effective are different modern systems, such as electronically scanned paper ballots and direct recording electronic (DRE) voting machines, for accurately and securely recording votes and protecting against voting fraud? How can people systematically compare and weigh the risks associated with different voting methods?",

As computers evolved from special-purpose devices to supporting general-purpose computation, they have continued to be an indispensable aid for scientific investigation and discovery like developing drugs to combat disease and simulating the environment to predict and possibly fight aspects of climate change. At the same time, the general purpose nature of computers allows them to be used as weapons of oppression, censorship, surveillance, and electronic warfare. What emerges is a view of the computer as a mostly beneficial weapon of science, including how it has shaped and continues to shape the kinds of questions that are feasible to address.",

Course Description: There are a number of biophilic historiographies de-centering human exceptionality and offering alternative renderings of existence and epistemology by bearing witness to the deep cultural and organic symbiosis with other species and matter. Fermentation\u2014as process, art, and metaphor\u2014offers another refractive aperture from which to consider issues at the pressure points of contemporary life. If, as scholars have suggested, fermentation names the transformative action of microorganisms, then, given the historical present and its attendant precarities and violences (e.g., massive economic inequity; neoliberal racial capitalism and necrophilia; climate crises; the return of the not-so-repressed (fascism); and, among others, global pandemics), it\u2019s maybe not surprising that many are turning to it as an ancestral and inherited practice. There are insights to be gained from understanding what fermentation does, how it does it, and why. As calls to transform everything from exploitative/extractive human relations to gut microflora mark both public and private discourse, fermentation offers a refractive lens from which to add to contemporary literature on multispecies ethnographies to regimes of microbiopolitics to theories of Eros and understandings of the state.",

Additionally, the persistent dangers of famine, plague, war, and early death created a climate of anxiety. All these influences were reflected in literature of the period and, particularly, in tragic drama. Using materials written by Shakespeare and his contemporaries students explore ways in which various emotions and psychological states found expression within the self, the family, the community, and the nation. Questions include: \"How do the passions work?\" \"How does a mind become 'diseased'?\" \"What is evil and how is it created?\" \"What behaviors exist in witches?\" \"How does self-absorption lead to wider social problems?\" A variety of literary sources, historical materials, and critical readings\u2014both early and modern\u2014are used throughout the course.

However, the cultural anthropological project is about both \u201cmaking the strange familiar\u201d and \u201cmaking the familiar strange.\u201d The global pandemic forced everyone to see the familiar in new ways; it allowed everyone to see like an anthropologist. Through looking at different cultural contexts--some quite far from most students\u2019 experiences, and others not so far from home--students become familiar with the questions anthropologists ask. The seminar is designed to introduce students to key areas of critical inquiry in cultural anthropology--culture theory, systemic racism, social inequities, sex/gender systems, kinship structures, and language in society.

However, people in our society know little about India and often carry misconceptions. Together, students explore the ways that religion, politics, society and culture interplay in modern India. Learning about religion\u2019s role in the modern nation-state benefit students with varied academic interests. Students are introduced to some of the religious traditions of India, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity and Sikhism. In addition to introducing the academic study of religion, questions are raised relevant to international relations, political science, history, and more. India provides an excellent setting to examine concerns we face today, such as: How might religion promote climate justice, or undermine it? How does religion relate to structures of social hierarchy? How do ancient wisdom and myth inform politics in the post colonial nation-state? Asian Religions makes a great first course in Religion, and Asian Studies, and has no prerequisites.\n\nCatalog Course Description:\nHow should we understand the relationship between religious texts and lived experiences? Why do religious differences sometimes harden and sometimes become porous depending on the context? Focusing on a single place and its people can help us break down traditional frameworks for understanding religion and reveals instead a much more dynamic image of religious diversity. Students are introduced to at least three major religions in a particular Asian region. In the process, it problematizes the traditional portrait of distinct and timeless world religions by taking a deeper look at the lived experiences of religious practitioners in one designated Asian society. The course utilizes a kaleidoscopic and multidisciplinary approach to the study of religion, allowing students to identify and appreciate the complex and sometimes unexpected ways in which religious practitioners live in diverse societies.",

Drawing upon the liberal arts tradition, the aim is to cultivate students' capacity for eloquence through inquiry. To foster this human impulse to inquire, students will engage in a number of inquiry projects that will ask them to reflect on their personal experiences, to analyze the forces that shaped those experiences, and to look critically at the way that social and cultural identity is formed. In conjunction with the three inquiry projects, students engage in an intense amount of work on rhetorical invention (the discovery of ideas for writing), composing a workable draft, reading and revising the draft, and rereading and editing it for fluency in grammar, punctuation, and style.

In order to do that, students visit a museum where they have an opportunity to engage with artifacts\u2013more importantly with their historical and cultural context\u2013and reflect on how memory is often relegated to artifacts that are collected and stored in a museum setting. Students think about the connections between public memory and trauma, archival practices, oral history, cultural heritage, and digital lives. Ultimately students collectively reflect on how meanings can be stabilized and destabilized through the circulation of public memory depending upon the social, cultural, and political conditions of the time.",

Where is rhetorical practice inextricable from the influence of ethnicity, race, language, and/or geography, and how do these factors come into play when speaking across cultural boundaries? Students survey the evolution of cultural rhetorics and explore prominent conversations currently occurring in the field. Readings include scholarship from leading voices, such as Christina Cedillo, V. Jo Hsu, Malea Powell, and Jacqueline Royster.

Have human beings ever successfully found a balance between themselves and their natural world? What events created today's environmental challenges? What leads to the downfall of a society?

A matrix of intellectual, social, and material forces that have transformed the world over the last quarter millennium, modernity has introduced new problems and possibilities into human life. Within modernity, issues of meaning, identity, and morality have been critiqued in distinctive ways. People of different social classes, racial groups, ethnic backgrounds, genders and sexual identities have contributed to an increasingly rich public discourse. The human psyche has been problematized, and the dynamic character of the world, both natural and social, has been explored. Urbanization and technological development have transformed the patterns of everyday life. Imperialism has had a complex and lasting impact on the entire globe. The human capability to ameliorate social and physical ills has increased exponentially, and yet so has the human capacity for mass destruction and exploitation. In this course, taught by an interdisciplinary staff, students explore texts from a variety of media that engage with the ideas and phenomena central to modernity. To ensure a substantially common experience for students, the staff each year chooses texts to be taught in all sections of the course. This component of the Core Curriculum encourages students to think broadly and critically about the world that they inhabit, asking them to see their contemporary concerns in the perspective of the long-standing discourses of modernity.",

Some scholars even believe that the \u201chunting instinct\u201d is a fundamental aspect of human identity. People in modern industrialized societies, however, often have little idea about the origins of the flesh they consume, most of which is raised and slaughtered on an industrial-scale. While the majority continue to eat meat, poultry, and/or fish, a minority have chosen to become vegetarians or even vegans for ethical, religious, cultural, health-oriented, or environmental reasons. Others continue to hunt and fish but within ecosystems dramatically altered by human intervention and amidst cultural landscapes complicated by commercialized and trophy hunting.  Drawing upon a wide range of sources including literature, artistic and documentary films, works of popular culture, autobiographical accounts, online hunting (and anti-hunting) forums, diverse web resources, self-reflective essays, and scholarly approaches ranging from animal studies to humanistic ecocriticism, this course investigates the intertwined themes of hunting, industrial versus small-scale farming and fishing, eating, vegetarianism, and the ethical and existential choices they present to members of modern industrialized societies.",

Later Confucian thought, under the influence of Buddhism, introduced additional questions about ethics and the human relationship to the cosmos. These intellectual traditions influenced generations of Chinese scholars and officials, and they also give insight into some of the unique aspects of Chinese society today.

The course identifies religion as a requisite multidimensional construct situated at the intersection of interdisciplinary theorizing and explanatory models regarding the etiologies of, and responses to, death-dealing disease and contagion.

By studying dance in wide-ranging contexts, students engage in conversations about race, gender, sexuality, class, and nationality. Students gain an understanding of the sociohistorical and cultural contexts in which dance practices are embedded, thereby becoming better equipped to recognize and unravel assumptions and hierarchies that have come to frame dancing bodies in predominant discourses.\n\nFrom consolidating and showcasing national identities for newly independent nations to providing a safe space for queer people outside the reach of hostile environments, dance has served a variety of critical functions in the lives of individuals and communities across time and space. Dance studies illuminates broad cultural, social, and political phenomena through the lens of dance and movement. As a growing field in the humanities, dance studies destabilizes the primacy of text in its insistence on body-based knowledge production. \n",

With a focus on contributions from the late 20th and 21st century, students historicize contemporary conversations by tracing conceptual and pragmatic topics back to key historical developments of Black feminist thought. Black feminists have always sought to understand how Black sexualities have been used to maintain gender and racial hierarchies. Such scholarship is the foundation of Queer of Color Critique and Black queer and sexuality studies. At the end of the course, students will have explored and had discussions about counter-hegemonic concepts, practices, and theory at the heart of Black women\u2019s embodiment, labor, and creativity.",

In its territorial extent, it would be matched only by the Roman Empire at its height, some 600 years later. To the Greeks, who managed to repel Darius's invasion as well as that of his son, Xerxes, the Persians were both fearsome and fascinating, the \"other\" against whom they fought but also defined themselves as Greeks, and the possessors of untold riches, unseen wonders, and unbelievable marvels. Students explore interactions between the Greeks and Persians from the foundation of the Achaemenid Empire in the middle of the sixth century BCE to its collapse in the wake of Alexander the Great's conquests. Students gain familiarity not only with a general narrative of Greco-Persian history but also with the various materials (archaeological, epigraphical, and literary) from which such a narrative is built. Through close examination of diverse sources (including Persian royal inscriptions, Greek historiography and tragedy, the Hebrew Bible, and Ferdowsi's Shahhameh, as well as more recent treatments in art, literature, and film), students work to understand how contact between these two distinct yet complementary cultures in antiquity has shaped discourse about the opposition between East and West up to the present day.",

Those discoveries spurred humanity's quest to control the flow of electric charges for their own good. With electrons, humans created light without fire, were able to send long-distance messages, and developed computing devices. Within a span of about two hundred years after the first modern inventions associated with electrons, human civilization has completely been transformed. Structured around lectures, discussions, demonstrations, readings, and research assignments, students learn about the human endeavor to understand electrons and how that understanding has shaped our civilization. Following the historical timeline of major discoveries associated with electricity & magnetism, students learn about the process of scientific discoveries and the development of electronics through the stories of individuals behind major discoveries in the context of contemporary sociocultural structures.

Unlike many courses focused on the history of math, there is additional emphasis on how mathematics is viewed by and used by society, in both positive and negative ways. Indeed, students learn how, in many cases, the prevailing mathematical culture of the time -- explicitly or implicitly -- rewarded malicious and, generally, unkind behavior. Questions raised include: how much have these aspects of mathematical culture changed? How have society's attitudes towards mathematics contributed to a problematic culture? How can one use mathematical literacy as a positive force?

        "course_description": "Originating contemporaneously with the agricultural transition during the Neolithic Revolution in Sumeria, alcoholic beverages produced from fermented grains have been ubiquitous throughout human history. Brewing practices were refined in medieval European monasteries and advanced to a science during the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions. Commercialization and globalization during the 20th century further changed the industry profile as well as the styles of beers produced. The craft beer revolution of the past forty years has generated a renewed interest in the artistry and science of brewing while creating a new generation of beer connoisseurs. Despite its growing popularity, brewing continues to face significant structural barriers restricting who has access to these spaces. This course will explore the historical, cultural, and economic forces that have influenced, and been influenced by, the production and consumption of beer in its many styles and varieties. Students who successfully complete this seminar will satisfy one half of the social relations, institutions, and agents area of inquiry requirement.  Benjamin Anderson, a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Economics, has been teaching at Colgate and calling Hamilton his home since 2011. In addition to teaching and research interests in the economics of sports, Ben is excited to teach a course combining his research interests in the industrial organization of agricultural and food industries with his personal interests in beer history and culture. He received his PhD in Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics from The Ohio State University in 2011 and his research has been published in the Journal of Industrial Economics, the American Journal of Agricultural Economics, the Journal of Sports Economics, and Applied Economics.",

In its essence, politics is about coming together to seek that good life as a community. We deliberate based on our assumption of what is ultimately good and also about what is most practical in a given situation, and though we may disagree, the search for this good life seems to be an integral part of our nature and happiness. This course brings into conversation a series of influential thinkers, both ancient and modern, who inspire us to think through our own purpose and the best (and worst) uses of the power of politics. Students who successfully complete this seminar receive credit for POSC 151 and satisfy one half of the social relations, institutions, and agents area of inquiry requirement.  Rachelle Walker, PhD, loves to study and teach primary sources on philosophy and politics, and hopes to ask big questions in order to live the best life.

Coursework draws on the resources of literature, literary criticism, history, philosophy, and cognitive science to examine how the concept of consciousness came to have the shape it currently does. Students trace an arc from late seventeenth-century philosophy and literature (Ren\u00e9 Descartes, John Locke) to late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century psychological treatments of \"stream of consciousness\" (William James), through techniques in the novels of Lawrence Sterne and Virginia Woolf, to more recent treatments of the conscious self by cognitive scientists (Douglas Hofstadter, Daniel Dennett).

However, earlier processes were already under way before the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet in the 1950s, which made the transition from a constellation of feudal polities to a nation possible. These included a common written language, common subsistence patterns (farming, pastoralism, and trade), Buddhism, participation in common rituals and festivals (especially religious pilgrimage), a certain respect for the authority of the Dalai Lamas, and so on. Students examine these processes as well as the consequences of China's political and economic incorporation of Tibetan areas into its nascent nation-state. Specific topics to be explored include \"the Tibet Problem\" (i.e. contemporary Sino-Tibetan relations and conflict), the historic colonial and religious ties between China Proper and Tibet, religious life and everyday Tibetans, \"nomadism\" (or pastoralism), polyandry and women in Tibet, and Tibetans' encounter with modernity and the West.

Thinking about bodily integrity, voluntary and informed consent and access and lack of it to healthcare resources, juxtaposed with marketing and corporate oriented economic models of pharmaceutical companies opens up space for critically assessing the trajectory of scientific research as it trickles down to consumerist medical practices. Further, contextualizing contemporary practices of pharmaceutical research and distribution through diverse ethnographic accounts allows for a deep understanding of a layered relationship between data and humans in the context of medical knowledge and practice. Concretely, this form of a critical assessment of contemporary pharmaceutical practices asks the following: In what ways\ndo the global networks of knowledge production and ideas surrounding ethical research shape, and are shaped by, the locally specific understandings of legal and medical ethics of care? How do the innovative and changing pharmaceutical landscapes inform the ways in which humans understand their own bodily and medical realities and identities?",

We can acknowledge the importance of such figures, however, without crowding out other, less prominent stories that are crucial for understanding this tumultuous period in British History. Britain underwent major political and religious changes between the late fifteenth and early eighteenth centuries, from the English and Scottish Reformations to the formation of the British state in 1707 from what had been the independent kingdoms of England and Scotland. Yet, these were far more than just high political developments. They had significant, and often hugely disruptive and traumatic effects on people\u2019s lives and communities, and on how people saw themselves in the world. Nonetheless, life went on, in ways that can seem both alien and surprisingly familiar\u2014and students use the myriad historical sources for this period, including diaries, newspapers, government records, and visual art, to do the imaginative and analytic work to understand how regular people experienced everyday life and major historical developments. In doing so, students also gain insight into the deep historical roots of modern social and political issues such as Brexit and the status of Northern Ireland. Students who successfully complete this seminar satisfy the social relations, institutions, and agents area of inquiry requirement.

That history traverses multiple continents and time periods and can be found across rich and distinctive media contexts including film, television, new media (including social media, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence), literature, fine arts, as well as museums and memorials. How has our understanding of the Holocaust been shaped by those representations? To what extent, if any, should we set limits on how those events are portrayed? What are the prospects of depicting the Holocaust in a period marked by a decline in the numbers of living historical witnesses and survivors, but a proliferation of historical, literary, and artistic renderings of their experiences? Central to those questions and to this class are issues pertaining to the aesthetic, conceptual, and ethical challenges of representing the Nazi genocide against the Jews and the potential for addressing contemporary genocides through the lens of the Holocaust. Students who successfully complete this seminar can satisfy the human thought and expression areas of inquiry requirement or the artistic practice and interpretation liberal arts practice.

For example, case studies in terror are paired with the field of trauma studies; specific regional conflicts with theories of global networks; and contemporary mass violence with analysis of genocide perpetration. In the process, students are introduced to important methodological paradigms from the social sciences, chiefly from anthropology, sociology, and geography, as well as humanities-based approaches from comparative religion, literature, and language studies.

It also examines the ideologies, institutions and practices introduced with the Spanish conquest and era of colonialism in order to understand their impact on indigenous society and their relevance to the state of underdevelopment that characterizes contemporary Peru. Study of present-day Peru juxtaposes rural and urban life, the ties between the two spheres, and the crisis conditions that enveloped both ways of life until recently.

        "course_description": "Modernity is a crucial element of the intellectual legacy to which we are heirs.  A matrix of intellectual, social, and material forces that have transformed the world over the last quarter millennium, modernity has introduced new problems and possibilities into human life. Within modernity, issues of meaning, identity, and morality have been critiqued in distinctive ways. People of different social classes, racial groups, ethnic backgrounds, genders and sexual identities have contributed to an increasingly rich public discourse. The human psyche has been problematized, and the dynamic character of the world, both natural and social, has been explored. Urbanization and technological development have transformed the patterns of everyday life. Imperialism has had a complex and lasting impact on the entire globe. The human capability to ameliorate social and physical ills has increased exponentially, and yet so has the human capacity for mass destruction and exploitation. In this course, taught by an interdisciplinary staff, students explore texts from a variety of media that engage with the ideas and phenomena central to modernity. To ensure a substantially common experience for students, the staff each year chooses texts to be taught in all sections of the course. This component of the Core Curriculum encourages students to think broadly and critically about the world that they inhabit, asking them to see their contemporary concerns in the perspective of the long-standing discourses of modernity.  In this section, students engage together with a matrix of intellectual, social, and material forces that have transformed the world over the last half-millenium and continue to shape modern life. Within modernity, issues of meaning, morality, knowledge, identity, power, choice, and the very nature of what it is to be a human, both publicly and privately, are common life themes experienced by diverse but also disproportionately represented populations. Like modernity itself, Challenges of Modernity functions within Colgate\u2019s curriculum as a common experience which inevitably and intentionally produces difference. Here in this section, students critically evaluate the same texts each year in order to elicit and analyze a range of perspectives and interpretations, and to deepen our understanding of the texture of commonality. The aim is to think broadly and critically about the shared world we inhabit, and to see our contemporary concerns in perspective relative to history and long-standing discourses. The work students do in this course feeds whatever discipline they major in, and whatever profession they assume. Students who successfully complete this seminar satisfy the Challenges of Modernity core requirement.  Assistant Professor Brynn Hatton is a historian of modern and contemporary art who primarily researches artistic forms of protest in the later 20th century. In this class, we'll explore the close historical relationship between art and politics, do some careful and close looking at individual art works from the past 200+ years, and interweave our observations and analysis with the larger class themes.",

However, it was only after the nineteenth century that major discoveries were made, including the realization that flowing charges were electrons.

With electrons, humans created light without fire, were able to send long-distance messages, and developed computing devices. Within a span of about two hundred years after the first modern inventions associated with electrons, human civilization has completely transformed. Through this course, structured around lectures, discussions, demonstrations, films, readings, and research assignments, students learn about the human endeavor to understand electrons and how that understanding has shaped our civilization. Students learn about the process of scientific discoveries, the development of electronics as we know it, and the historical timeline of major discoveries that revolutionized our civilization. Students also develop insight into the impact of these discoveries on our society, lifestyle, health, finance, national security, and sustainability.Students who successfully complete this seminar satisfy the Scientific Perspective core requirement.

A diverse group of contemporary German-language authors position themselves as Jewish writers engaged in probing the complex constellations of identity and intergenerational trauma and memory after the Shoah. Much of their work is centered on the Jewish experience in German and Austrian cultures, yet always in a web of relations to other places, their contexts, and languages - for example, Israel and the US, France and Algeria, Russia and Poland. Seismic shifts in national borders and transnational mobility, including German unification in 1990, the immigration of many Jews from the former Soviet Union to Germany and more recent demographic influences of migration of the 21st century, are further reshaping the topographies of intersectional identities and society that these writers explore. Students examine the relationships of generational position, gender, and literary voice; the interfaces of personal stories, historical knowledge, and contemporary local contexts; the politics and collective understandings of the memory of the Shoah; and the roles of literary representations in shaping that memory as time passes and personal memory disappears. Readings include fiction, essays, interviews, songs, and articles by Wolf Biermann, Ruth Beckermann, Maxim Biller, Irene Dische, Olga Grjasnowa, Lena Gorelik, Barbara Honigmann, Wladimir Kaminer, Ruth Kliiger, Katja Petrowskaja, Doron Rabinovici, Robert Schindel and others. \n\nMay be taught in English translation or in German, depending on the semester and student interests and background.

A diverse group of contemporary German-language authors position themselves as Jewish writers engaged in probing the complex constellations of identity and intergenerational trauma and memory after the Shoah. Much of their work is centered on the Jewish experience in German and Austrian cultures, yet always in a web of relations to other places, their contexts, and languages - for example, Israel and the US, France and Algeria, Russia and Poland. Seismic shifts in national borders and transnational mobility, including German unification in 1990, the immigration of many Jews from the former Soviet Union to Germany and more recent demographic influences of migration of the 21st century, are further reshaping the topographies of intersectional identities and society that these writers explore. Students examine the relationships of generational position, gender, and literary voice; the interfaces of personal stories, historical knowledge, and contemporary local contexts; the politics and collective understandings of the memory of the Shoah; and the roles of literary representations in shaping that memory as time passes and personal memory disappears. Readings include fiction, essays, interviews, songs, and articles by Wolf Biermann, Ruth Beckermann, Maxim Biller, Irene Dische, Olga Grjasnowa, Lena Gorelik, Barbara Honigmann, Wladimir Kaminer, Ruth Kliiger, Katja Petrowskaja, Doron Rabinovici, Robert Schindel and others. \n\nMay be taught in English translation or in German, depending on the semester and student interests and background.

By examining the literary style of selected philosophical texts, as well as the philosophical significance of various literary works of art, students focus on how different modes of writing are able to address traditional questions of philosophy and to illuminate significant features of human existence. Could philosophy itself perhaps be understood as a literary enterprise? And what is the philosophical significance of literary works, written in poetic or narrative form, that explore the same aspects of human experience that are also studied by philosophers who use more prosaic modes of writing? Students explore these questions in relation to such literary and philosophical authors as J.M. Coetzee, Italo Calvino, Stanley Cavell, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Iris Murdoch, Martha Nussbaum, Friedrich Schiller, Shakespeare and others.",

How should one explain the roles currently played by religion, including militant violence across Asia? Is it a revolt against the uncertainties produced by modernization? How do people interpret foundational religious concepts when responding to changing circumstances including the place of state and non-state?

To expose discrepancies in popularized narratives of Black girls and women in the United States, the course is organized around the tenet of celebration and other foundational concepts and scholars within the field. Drawing on theories and concepts derived from Black feminist thought, budding scholars will approach Black girlhood as a political category of identity and symbol of agency. Working within and beyond hip-hop feminist and womanist frameworks, learning will involve critical thinking and embodiment of theories and practices as produced by Black girls, artists, and scholars. With attention to knowledge and creativity engendered amidst legacies of anti-Black racism and racialized femininity, Corridors of Black Girlhood reveals the contributions of Black girls, girlhood, and Black feminist thought to the expansion of theory, praxis, and power analyses.",

In so doing, Galileo challenged not only the authority of Aristotelian cosmology, but also the religious tradition and interpretation of the scripture by the Holy Fathers of the Catholic Church. This episode in the history of western science and the development of the Church is often cited as one of the original clashes between modern science and religious traditions. The discoveries, writings, and trial of Galileo Galilei will serve as both a focus and backdrop for students to explore the practical development of scientific thought and the near simultaneous invention and re-invention of the Church. In addition to readings, written responses, and classroom discussions, the course requires students to repeat many of the ground-breaking observations Galileo made using a hand-held refracting telescope similar in size and shape to the one he built.",

Among other topics for examination are the discoveries of modern playhouse archaeology, the private lives of actors and theatre owners, the formation of theatre companies and their travel routes (both in and out of England), the commercial workings of theatres as businesses, playhouses as movable construction, the theatres as part of a much larger entertainment network, and, finally, the changing political position of the theatres that led ultimately to their demise.",

In the process students discover that beneath conflicting theories are recurring themes concerning subjectivity and objectivity, the nature of human beings, theories of self and other, as well as a debate over rationality, irrationality, truth, and knowledge. By better understanding these controversies students gain new insights into human nature, human knowledge, and the human condition.",

Working within and beyond hip-hop feminist and womanist frameworks, learning will involve critical thinking and embodiment of theories and practices as produced by Black girls, artists, and scholars.

Furthermore, the word \"Maya\" serves as an umbrella term that refers to a number of diverse populations, each with distinct culture, language, and material culture. Students focus on both the construction of the pan-Maya identity, and the numerous populations included within the concept, such as the Tzel Tal, Tzotzil, Kaqchikel, K'iche', Chantal, and the Lacandon, just to name a few. Each of these groups has distinct histories, which often demonstrated significant clashes with colonial and modern national hegemonies. Coursework also highlights how tradition, language, and identity are preserved under the forces of colonial and nationalistic domination and also delves into the subject of changing traditions, as these Maya movements of resistance have integrated social media, rock music, and hip-hop to engage younger generations. Ultimately, the Maya provide a means of deconstructing the concept of identity itself by demonstrating how shared identities are constructed, contested, and negotiated.",

Students examine mobility\u2014and its flip-side, immobility\u2014through examples and approaches from geographies of tourism, transportation, im/migration, dis/ability, commodity circulation and economic geography, and demography. Diverse examples may include unsanctioned mobilities, like the figure of the tramp or the vagabond, nomadic populations like the Roma and seasonal migrant workers; subversive and surveilled mobilities, like transnational drug trafficking; and the politics of transportation infrastructures, like the transcontinental railroad and its role in expanding settler colonial power. Students also consider how the mobility of commodities, objects, and materials makes and remakes our world, and what kinds of mobilities\u2014human and nonhuman\u2014climate change produces and inhibits. Finally, we ask: how do geographers of various backgrounds theorize, study, map, and write about mobility?

From medieval debates among Muslim scholars to contemporary nation-state politics of immigration, race has played a significant role in establishing hierarchies of difference, as well as boundaries of inclusion and exclusion, across much of the region. Rather than presuming the stability of race as a concept across time and space, the construction of racial difference is examined through specific historical processes and political contexts, while engaging in dialogue with literature on race from the Americas and the Atlantic world. Historical dynamics include: Indian Ocean slavery, Tran\u00adSaharan slavery and the relationship of both with Islamic law, colonial rule, and transregional solidarities during decolonization. Political and anthropological contexts include: genealogy and kinship, postcolonial nationalism, transnational immigration, and expressive culture and historical memory. Concepts from scholarship on race include: slavery and transculturation, racial capitalism, and racial formations.",

Tracing the contexts, relationships, and evolutionary history of the musical fabrics of these seminal works can provide, perhaps, a deeper view of cultural changes, important aesthetic shifts, and, ultimately, a deeper understanding and appreciation of the history from which popular new works have emerged.",

        "course_description": "A look at how illness, health, and healing are understood and experienced in parts of the ancient Mediterranean world, between 500 BCE and 600 CE, where illness is not defined merely as a physiological problem, but is also seen to have important spiritual, aesthetic, social, and political causes and effects. Similarly, while biomedicine defines health as the absence of disease, in ancient medicine, health is about achieving balance between different elements in the body, such as wind, water, and fire. Students develop an appreciation for the culturally and historically patterned ways in which people come to identify and treat bodily, psychological, and social distress. For instance, students examine curses and spirit possession in a variety of contexts as both a form of affliction and as a mode of healing. Students look at the role of traditional healers; how cultures vary in what they consider to be the causes of illness; who gets sick; what forms illness takes; and how the social, political, and aesthetic dimensions of health and healing affect treatment outcomes. Readings are drawn from the fields of ancient medical texts, medical humanities, ethnomedicine, and the anthropology of religion, to explore how illness and health are conceptualized and experienced in different cultures and across different sites of healing.",

Focus is on the social construction of race and ethnicity, immigration, assimilation, and the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of assimilation, interracial marriage. Coursework also highlights the experiences of Asian Americans as they consistently have the highest rates of intermarriage among large racial groups in the U.S. Despite the canonical view that interracial marriage is the final stage of assimilation, there are reasons to critically examine its social significance when we intersectionally consider its peculiarities and asymmetries across race and gender. When members of different groups intermarry, does this signify that these groups are becoming more similar? Is this a sign of social integration, hybridization, or something else?",

Students examine death from the perspective of US- based health-care professionals, family members, institutions, the funeral industry, and the dying themselves. In so doing, students discuss who has access to \u201ca good death,\u201d ethical issues in how death is defined, how these realities are shaped by structural inequalities, and policy suggestions for the future. Initially, students focus on intersections between death and dying, COVID-19, race, gender, and age. From there the course readings expand out to biographical, journalistic and social science sources to explore cross-cultural rituals of death, dying, and grieving.Students visit (in some cases, virtually) a hospice home for the dying and/or a funeral home, and a local cemetery, participate in a Death Caf\u00e9, and explore writing their own obituaries. Counts as a Research Intensive (RI) course.",
