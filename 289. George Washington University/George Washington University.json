Students learn how to scan, import, and create artwork and how to correct and adjust image tone and color. Students also use Photoshop's many selection and editing tools and are introduced to layers, channels, color palettes, and scripted actions. By going through lessons ranging from image retouching to title banner and button creation and simple time-based animation, students assemble and produce a simple website which showcases a portfolio of their own work. In addition to the projects above, students are introduced to the theories and practices of visual communications and graphic design through a series of lectures and demonstrations. Other Adobe CS software such as InDesign are touched on as well."

It is a situation that requires leaders who are able to engage and mobilize people and organizations across sectors. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to the multi-sector landscape and to provide you with an interdisciplinary framework you can use to effectively mobilize individuals and organizations across sectors. Using case studies and simulations the course will explore the core challenges and opportunities facing multi-sector leaders in business, government, and in the non-profit sector. The course will stress the need for you to look outside of your immediate organizational environment and to take a broader view on the identities, incentives, and social roles that influence attitudes and behavior across sectors.

This will include readings, lecturettes, case studies, whole class/small group discussions,examination of current policy issues in the news, reflections on personal experience, and application of the policy analysis process to real world issues. There will also be exploration of some the critical competencies that today\u2019s leaders need to effectively contribute to the policy analysis process (e.g. critical thinking, executive perspective, team leadership/influence). Particular emphasis will be placed on understanding how these concepts apply in organizational situations."
