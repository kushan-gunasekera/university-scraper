Part II debates multiple explanations for these developments. This includes (i) accounts focusing upon the rise of specific strongman leaders and elite enablers; (ii) falling electoral support for moderate parties, party system fragmentation, and the growing popularity of authoritarian-populist parties; (iii) the spread of misinformation and disinformation in the digital age; (iv) legal-institutional design flaws failing to check executive aggrandizement; (v) structural drivers and economic inequality in mass society; (vi) the impact of nativism, population migration, and growing ethnic and racial diversity; (vii) new electoral cleavages due to cultural shifts in social values; and (viii) global struggles in international relations pitting Western allies against the forces of authoritarian states.

Nevertheless, until the adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the world&#39;s largest minority group was largely excluded from global human rights protection (e.g., UN human rights treaty work), global initiatives (notably the Millennium Development Goals), and national level&nbsp;law and policy programming, with the majority of States having internally uncoordinated health or social welfare initiatives. The CRPD has now been ratified by 186 of the 193 UN&nbsp;Member States, making it the fastest ratified human rights treaty, and nearly universal in scope. Meanwhile, the MDGs successor program, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by consensus at the UN in 2016 and require the inclusion of persons with disabilities in their social transformation mandate. In consequence of these global schemes, States are struggling to develop coordinated and efficient national level programming for their disabled populations, until-now their typically neglected yet largest minority group. This course examines how States develop national level programming to include persons with disabilities across a variety of sectors including health, education, employment, community inclusion, and social welfare and development. Throughout the course we will examine critically the tension between human rights and their aspiration of full human flourishing and the constraints placed upon States by resource, social, cultural, and other limitations.

        "course_description": "<p>American democracy is in crisis. Politicians talk past each other, national policymaking is increasingly calcified, and states pursue wildly diverging policies that frequently contradict, or even directly challenge, one another. Traditionally apolitical policies are politicized. People tune in to separate and distinct information streams from which they receive contradictory messages about what constitute the nation&rsquo;s problems, and how best to fix them. They increasingly don&rsquo;t like each other and seem unable or unwilling to communicate across partisan or ideological lines. Policy disagreement becomes personal animus. More Americans embrace seemingly outlandish conspiracy theories, while it grows difficult for even attentive citizens to distinguish truth from falsehood. All of this is reflected in everything from our lifestyles and social interactions to our consumer behaviors to our politics and public policy. How did we get here? And, most important, what can we do about it? This course will explore these questions through the lens of political communication. To do so, we will consider political communication from the perspectives of three sets of actors: the public, the media -- including traditional (e.g., TV, newspaper, radio), partisan (e.g., cable TV news and online) and social (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) media -- and policymakers/politicians. In each case, we will consider why the actors make the choices they make. Specifically, we will assess the strategic incentives of all three groups of actors (citizens, journalists, policymakers) and how those incentives can interact to produce unanticipated, and sometimes undesirable, consequences. As we begin to understand the <em>nature </em>of political communication and the <em>causes </em>of our current political communication breakdown, we will consider its effects on various aspects of American democracy, from social justice issues, to voting and elections, to public policymaking. Finally, we will explore various possible solutions to some of the most vexing communication-related challenges we face, from eroding trust in democratic institutions, to hyper-polarization to misinformation and conspiracy beliefs.</p>"

Modern computational and statistical methods offer the promise of greater efficiency, equity, and transparency, but their use also raises complex legal, social, and ethical questions. In this course, we examine the often subtle relationship between law, public policy, and technology, drawing on recent court decisions, and applying methods from economics, statistics, and machine learning. We survey the legal and ethical principles for assessing the equity of algorithms, describe computational techniques for designing fairer systems, and consider how anti-discrimination law and the design of algorithms may need to evolve to account for machine bias. Concepts will be developed in part through guided in-class coding exercises, though prior programming experience is not necessary.</p>"

The Internet is also a technology that very few people, and almost no policy makers, understand. As governments and citizen&rsquo;s groups clamor for mechanisms to make the internet more fair, less toxic, or more inclusive it is imperative that some understanding of the core technology grounds these discussions. This class is meant to introduce the myriad things that people are talking about when they talk about the Internet. Starting with a short history of how the Internet started, we will move to a discussion of how the Internet actually works at various levels, and the set of services that allow non-technical people to utilize it. We will then move to how the various parts of the Internet are governed, and examine why it is so difficult to make changes to the technology.</p><p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-top: 3pt;margin-bottom: 7pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Calibri';font-size:10pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-top: 3pt;margin-bottom: 7pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Arial';\">&nbsp;</span></p><p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-top: 3pt;margin-bottom: 7pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Arial';\">&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

These harms persist despite the proliferation of international norms and structures designed to protect this population and promote its wellbeing. In many cases global transformations exacerbate rather than reduce the risks of abuse and increase the protection challenges these risks give rise to. Though each category of child protection deficit has its own characteristics and its attendant normative framework, they all share common and definable elements. An investigation of the human rights dilemmas that arise in child protection on a global scale presents, in a microcosm, a perspective on the social and political dynamics affecting some of the world&#39;s most vulnerable populations. One focus of the course is the child protection issues themselves, their genesis and impact. The other is the human rights strategies and dilemmas relevant to those (at both the individual and societal levels) charged with responding to rights violations affecting children and fulfilling public child protection obligations. In the midst of historic technological advances and significant progress in the realm of international human rights, the strategic choices and responsibilities facing leaders and others concerned with child protection are of increasing complexity and scope. A key concern of the course will be to integrate legal approaches with those developed in the health and social sciences. A recurring theme will be the evaluation of how international obligations map onto policy outcomes and how human rights mechanisms affect problems facing vulnerable children on the ground.

Most fundamentally, what can any single person do &ndash; what kinds of action are most likely to make a difference?</p><p>In this small, discussion-based seminar we will practice learning to hold all that is happening and nonetheless finding the courage and the skill to act. We will explore the development of &ldquo;radical hope&rdquo;, and the possibility that this moment could be one not only of catastrophe but also of individual and collective transformation; and we will take a deep dive into alternative theories of change and potentially skillful pathways to action. It is often said that we need deep, systemic change &ndash; in this seminar we will explore what such change might look like and how it might be catalyzed.</p><p>We will structure our conversation by focusing on three distinct but potentially complementary narratives: <em>Techno-Optimism</em>, or &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; the current system of socio-economic and political relationships, <em>Revolutionize the system </em>or pathways towards the radical reform or replacement of the current system, and <em>Changing our minds</em>, or why responding effectively to our times might require a radical shift in the ways in which we relate to ourselves, to each other, and to the natural world and what this might look like in practice.</p><p>Throughout the class we will explore what all this might mean for <u>you </u>&ndash; for the way you experience yourself, for how you frame the meaning and purpose of your life, and for how you decide to engage with the world.</p><p>Participants will be asked to write a short reflection paper each week and a final paper.</p><p>Admission is actually by application only, and is available here: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hbs.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8vnweYhvK0VEjrM\" target=\"_blank\">https://hbs.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8vnweYhvK0VEjrM</a>.

These worries have continued and evolved as the technology of communication has been seen as a technology of surveillance. The modern world of computers, cell phones, CCTV-camera, and the emerging Internet of Things offer unprecedented opportunities for tracking everything everyone does.&nbsp; At the same time, policy around the right to privacy and indeed the definition of what privacy means have evolved in different ways in different countries. European laws attempt to protect the privacy of the individual from corporations, while U.S. law tries to protect the privacy of the individual from the government. Corporations doing business in multiple jurisdictions find themselves subject to conflicting and sometimes contradictory rules and regulations, while users find it difficult to know what rights they have with respect to their interactions.&nbsp; This course will look at the state of both policy and technology surrounding privacy. Is the technology capable of the kinds of panopticon-style surveillance that critics worry about? What laws cover the use and abuse of such technology, both in the United States and abroad? What is meant by privacy, and how can it be preserved in the face of ongoing technology? And how can nation-states regulate the gathering, access, and use of the information we generate with our technology to preserve some sense of privacy and autonomy?&nbsp;&nbsp;How does an individual&rsquo;s right to privacy balance against the requirements of security or public health? Most of all, what problems have a technological solution, and what problems require oversight and policy changes?</p><p>For additional information about technology courses at HKS please visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/digitalhks/roadmap/home\">https://medium.com/digitalhks/roadmap/home</a>.</p>"

The results are often limited.&nbsp;In many cases this is because the challenges in development are too complex to allow for effective planning or to support the success of ex ante strategies in reform or policy execution. In the face of such complex challenges, we believe that practitioners should be using more flexible facilitated emergence methods, where they focus on problems instead of solutions, move forward step by step (instead of following a long-term plan) and allow for flexible adaptation (instead of control-oriented implementation). Even though many development practitioners see the rationale behind this argument, and even agree that a more flexible approach is needed, they do not know HOW to pursue a process that is not based on &lsquo;plan and control&rsquo;. These practitioners often do not know what alternative methods involve.&nbsp;In response to this, the current course introduces students to a specific alternative approach to doing what we call facilitated emergence. This approach is called problem driven iterative adaptation (PDIA) and is the approach taken through the Building State Capability (BSC) Program at the Center for International Development (CID) at HKS. Students will engage in a short application of PDIA to get a feel for how one might do facilitated emergence, learning how to facilitate discussions about problems and potential solutions, engage with teams, and facilitate an iterative learning process.</p>"

Throughout the course, students will be challenged to navigate differences in expectations, ethical and cultural norms, power, status, partisan perceptions and attitudes toward risk. We will work to understand diverse perspectives, to reassess and adapt strategies, to give other parties incentives to cooperate, to negotiate effectively as a team, to set up helpful communication processes, and to build trust across boundaries. The goal of the course is to help students be better equipped to anticipate challenges in advance, to expand their conception of &quot;what is possible&quot; in order to develop creative and wise strategies, to build sustainable coalitions to support their goals, and to gain confidence in advocating for themselves and others.</p>"

They must be equipped with relevant sense-making frameworks, analytical tools and interpersonal abilities to maintain productive relationships with difficult counterparts as they search for realistic compromises on programmatic options. These divisive tensions have been particularly visible in the response to recent crises, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, recent climate-fueled disasters and the various surges of migrants at the borders. Public officials and civil society organizations alike are not only expected to plan an adequate response to these crises but also to prevent and mitigate the risks of their instrumentalization by various political groups. These divisions and their exploitation on social media directly affect the capacity of governments to build the necessary consensus among stakeholders to put into place proper programs.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#333333;\">To fulfill their role in such environments, policy professionals need to acquire specific capabilities to lead constructive engagements with a wide range of stakeholders from the most supportive to the most disruptive, while maintaining a degree of control over their message in this interconnected information world. Such capabilities involve the ability of building trust in a tense public arena and managing effectively adversarial relationships with actors opposed to the proposed policies. Engaging successfully with difficult counterparts is expected to become a crucial skillset of policymakers responding to all sorts of crises over the coming years. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#333333;\">The main objectives of the course are:</span></p><ol> <li><span style=\"color:#333333;\">Develop a solid understanding of the social, behavioral and cognitive implications of political tensions in society and review conceptual frameworks related to conflict management in the public policy and public health domains;</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#333333;\">Equip students with the required strategic frameworks and tactical tools to engage in high-stake policy dialogue and negotiation;</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#333333;\">Provide students with core competences on complex negotiation informed by current practices from the political, public health and humanitarian sectors;</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#333333;\">Expand students&rsquo; skill set and enhance their self-confidence to engage in intense face-to-face negotiation with intimidating counterparts; and,</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#333333;\">Connect students with negotiation professionals from various sectors and offer opportunities to expand their personal network across this arcane domain.</span></li></ol><p><span style=\"color:#333333;\">Through an experiential learning approach, the course will present a systematic methodology to engage in complex negotiations in a proactive, critical, and practical manner.

While there is increasing awareness of the lack of DEI in business, government and non-profit organizations, progress has been slow. We argue that one of the reasons for this is that organizations have used the wrong approaches, often copying peers&rsquo; &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; that are not based on &ldquo;best evidence&rdquo; and attempting to find &ldquo;quick wins&rdquo; for specific groups and departments in an uncoordinated fashion with little regard for the long-term DEI health of the organization. To promote healthy behaviors, organizations have typically relied on &ldquo;soft&rdquo; instruments such as awareness-raising and appeals through training programs, or &ldquo;hard&rdquo; instruments such as command-and-control through rules, carrots and sticks. This course argues that behavioral design (&ldquo;nudges&rdquo;) offers a middle ground to establish healthy behaviors and is often more powerful than awareness-raising and less costly than shoves.</p><p>In working with and learning from practitioners across sectors&mdash;entrepreneurs who have built evidence-based DEI tools; Human Resources (HR) and DEI leaders; as well as policymakers and -shapers&mdash;we will explore nudges that promote desired behaviors around effective talent management, organizational policies and practices that level the playing field for all, and inclusive culture.&nbsp;The course emphasizes evidence-based reasoning to diagnose the &ldquo;DEI health&rdquo; of an organization, design potential treatments for what is broken, and rigorously evaluate their impact, as well as motivate adoption of the best evidence in organizations. Students will work in small groups on specific DEI challenges and will have the opportunity to present their ideas to DEI leaders.</p><p>There are no requirements for this course. Familiarity with behavioral science (e.g., having read the book Nudge and/or having taken MLD-304, Science of Behavior Change) and/or comfort with using data are advantages. The instructor&rsquo;s particular expertise is behavioral science and gender, and the course will heavily draw on the book What Works: Gender Equality by Design.

By Friday evening, under international media scrutiny, through coordination of multiple federal, state and local agencies, private sector professionals, and countless volunteers, two bombers had been identified, one lay dead and the other in custody, hundreds of wounded had been successfully treated, recovery throughout the region was well underway, and &ldquo;Boston Strong&rdquo; had become a globally-recognized tagline.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, terrorist attacks in America are relatively uncommon, but public calamities in general &mdash; like infrastructure failures or public health emergencies &mdash; are less and less so. Public crises place complex demands on public leaders, ranging from directing recovery efforts to addressing follow-on risks to restoring order. To meet these moments, leaders must effectively communicate, coordinate, execute, comfort and otherwise act, often without complete information or even clear authority.&nbsp;</p><p>In this course, we will explore approaches public leaders have used to navigate through a variety of high-stakes public crises, and lessons those experiences teach about effective leadership in a crisis. In addition to terrorist attacks, health crises and infrastructure failures, examples will include natural disasters, economic emergencies and political scandals. Mindful that in many public leadership positions it is increasingly difficult to differentiate between crisis and routine, we will attempt to develop an understanding of how to anticipate and prepare for various types of crises by engaging with stakeholders, and how strategy, administration, execution and communication can shape crisis response. So that students can begin to develop their own approaches to leading through public crises, the class will (1) conduct simulations to help students better appreciate the practical, ethical and sometimes political decisions public leaders must confront in public emergencies, and (2) engage with practitioners as guests in class who have experienced crisis response so that students can inquire directly about the leadership choices our guests have faced and the strategies they used to move their teams and their constituents forward.</p><p>This course will touch upon, but not limit itself to how to communicate during a crisis. Other courses at the Kennedy School go more deeply into that important subject. This course addresses how public leaders in the &ldquo;hot seat&rdquo; can anticipate and then more effectively and holistically lead through the emergency with an eye on the long-term consequences for all stakeholders.</p>"

This module is designed to help students navigate careers fueled by aspirations to contribute to the public good, including considerations of work-life and wellbeing. With a primary focus on their next five-to-ten years, the course will help students frame their choices, explore and develop their options, and ultimately create a working plan for moving forward.</p><p>Drawing on evidence from the study of professional careers and leadership journeys, work-family conflict and integration, and wellbeing, the module adopts a broader &ldquo;life&rdquo; perspective. The course is grounded in the premise that HKS students have agency in determining the direction of their careers. While not everything is planned and certain, self-direction is possible and is likely to be facilitated by actively exploring alternative paths.</p><p>Students should be prepared for a substantial course load, with rigorous work expectations in and out of classroom.

From lack of personal protective equipment to virus test kits to toilet paper, failures in supply lines are taking a toll on our lives.</p><p>The efficient delivery of quality public services is a core requirement of government agencies. Supply chain management (SCM) is the structured approach for meeting this requirement. Supply chains are the systems and processes that transform resources into services ranging from healthcare to education to emergency response to criminal justice. Procurement, inventory, transformation, distribution, and transportation all must be managed individually and in concert with each other to achieve public policy objectives.</p><p>Systems thinking, a holistic framework for understand how components of a system become an integrated, unified and optimized whole, is the foundation for effective SCM. Systems thinking ensures we understand the feedback loops that exist in supply chains and the non-linear nature of the real world. The empty grocery store shelves resulting from a demand spike in advance of a hurricane or blizzard illustrates how one change in the chain, an increase in demand, ripples through the entire system for weeks.</p><p>This course provides students with the theory and practice to design, operate and sustain supply chains that deliver public services. We will explore both product chains (e.g. personal protective equipment for hospitals and school lunches) and service chains (e.g. the delivery of criminal justice and early childhood education).&nbsp; The course begins with an exploration of the critical role of supply chains in service delivery through an examination of successes and failures. Next, the effective management of each link in the supply chain is studied. Then systems thinking is explained to see how comprehensive supply chains are designed and implementation requirements defined. The course concludes with an investigation of supply chains can be modified to achieve public purpose.</p><p>The course pedagogy features case study and practitioner-based learning. Materials are drawn from developing and developed world contexts.
