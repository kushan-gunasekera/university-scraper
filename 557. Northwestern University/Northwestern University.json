The course will then focus on epistemology, theoretical perspective, and methodology. (We will not address methods, as they are addressed more centrally in the quant and qual methods sequences.) We will identify key methodologies of interest to course participants (ie. experimental design, quasi-experimental, developmental designs, case study, ethnography, participatory, etc.) and provide an overview of each. Finally, we will also spend some time on the craft of writing research proposals."

Topics include gene-environment correlations, gene-environment interactions, epigenetics, and theoretical models for the interplay between biological systems and ecological conditions. We will learn some basic facts about brain development, stress physiology, and immune functioning, and will examine social-environmental influences on these systems. Special emphasis is placed on the social influences on stress-system biology, a major pathway by which socio-emotional experience affects the body, brain and developmental outcomes."

When an individual holds multiple identities that have traditionally been marginalized, any discrimination experienced will be different than someone without that unique blend of identities. To use Crenshaw's initial example in 1989, Black women experience a different type of racism than Black men, and a different form of sexism than White women. Thirty years later, researchers still are coming to terms with what this means in the public sphere, but also in research which underlines the importance of thinking about identity more comprehensively and completely. In this class, we will begin by addressing the question of what intersectionality is. We will also consider how considering identity as intersectional alters our understanding of policy, and what policy should address. Importantly, we will consider how to incorporate intersectionality into a basic framework of research and analysis through a term-long project."

An overarching theme of the course addresses how new practices and organizational forms spread (diffusion), how they stick (institutionalization) and how they take the form that they do (emergence). Topics covered will include accountability and performance, organizational learning, contemporary debates about social mechanisms, and micro-foundations of institutional theory.

Individuals and organizations often trust institutions with their data with the expectation that one's data is private from others or to the handling institutions and that it is not used for unfair practices. To ensure the privacy of sensitive data, privacy mechanisms have been developed to preserve the privacy of data without reducing its functionality.   The goal of this course is to introduce you to the concept and implications of data privacy, including mechanisms and protocols that are used to preserve data privacy in practice. We will study concepts such as differential privacy, database anonymization, anonymous communication, and algorithmic fairness. We will also discuss privacy in the context of web privacy, social network privacy, human factors, and machine learning along with any policy implications."

Performance-critical systems and application software would be impossible to build and evolve without compilers that derive highly optimized machine code from high-level source code that humans can understand. Understanding what modern code analysis and transformation techniques can and can't do is a prerequisite for research on both software engineering and computer architecture since hardware relies on software to realize its potential. In this class, you will learn the fundamentals of code analysis and transformation, and you will apply them by extending LLVM, a compiler framework now in production use by Apple, Adobe, Intel and other industrial and academic enterprises."

Hence, the course will help you build a foundational understanding of PLs by breaking them down to their most basic ingredients without having to go through PLAI or another meta language. In other words, the course will teach you how to construct mathematical models of PLs. Moreover, because of their mathematical and foundational nature, these models will enable you to describe precisely properties of PLs that in CS 321 we only talked about in an intuitive manner."

In addition, we encourage students to participate in the UCSB International Capture the Flag Competition. Capture the Flag is a network security exercise where the goal is to exploit other machines while defending your own. In fact, this course should prepare you for any one of many capture the flag competitions that take place year-round.  We will learn about different types of hacks and perform them. After learning how to execute such exploits and penetrate a network, we will discuss ways to protect a network from others exploiting the same vulnerabilities.

As a result, data privacy has become an increasingly significant concern in the past several years. Individuals and organizations often trust institutions with their data with the expectation that one's data is private from others or to the handling institutions and that it is not used for unfair practices. To ensure the privacy of sensitive data, privacy mechanisms have been developed to preserve the privacy of data without reducing its functionality.   The goal of this course is to introduce you to the concept and implications of data privacy, including mechanisms and protocols that are used to preserve data privacy in practice. We will study concepts such as differential privacy, database anonymization, anonymous communication, and algorithmic fairness. We will also discuss privacy in the context of web privacy, social network privacy, human factors, and machine learning along with any policy implications."

And by simple, I mean as simple as high-school algebra. Hence, the course will help you build a foundational understanding of PLs by breaking them down to their most basic ingredients without having to go through PLAI or another meta language. In other words, the course will teach you how to construct mathematical models of PLs. Moreover, because of their mathematical and foundational nature, these models will enable you to describe precisely properties of PLs that in CS 321 we only talked about in an intuitive manner."

In this course students will study deep learning architectures such as autoencoders, , convolutional deep neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. They will read original research papers that describe the algorithms and how they have been applied to fields like computer vision, automatic speech recognition, and audio event recognition.  For projects, students can work on their own or in groups (recommended) to write a codebase that reproduces a landmark research paper.

Students learn the principles of acoustic signals and the neuroanatomy and physiology of the auditory system, and from this foundation explore how speech and music are processed by the nervous system. Auditory learning and the brain's ability to change with sonic experience will be explored through a range of case studies related to vocal learning (birdsong), auditory expertise (bilinguals and musicians), and training and remediation strategies for the treatment of communication difficulties. Students are shown the vital social implications of sound science through discussions of hearing health, music education, and clinical approaches to communication disorders."

But most importantly, this class will allow students to develop new creative methods in design processes and give back to the design community."
