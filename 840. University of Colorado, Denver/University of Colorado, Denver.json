Today\u2019s leaders must be transversal: highly strategic and operational while able to understand and connect clinical, market access, commercial, finance, and strategy.\nThe Leadership in a Global Environment course seeks to offer students a foundation for understanding the intricate and complex relationship between language, culture, communicative practices, and the role we play as individuals in the globalized work environment of today. In particular, this course is geared to emerging and developing global leaders. Today\u2019s leaders must be incredibly versatile.
