Perhaps the clearest example of this change is the evolution of computer programming as a respected and highly paid profession.  But those who work directly with computers are not the only ones affected.  As computing systems have steadily reorganized aspects of society, the idea of what counts as labor has changed.  This course introduces students to historical and contemporary issues in the history of technology to explain how our national and global work forces are shaped by digital, electronic technology.  We will look at everything from World War II electronic codebreaking to present-day struggles over net neutrality.  We will also look at the \"hidden labor\" behind our digital technologies, from hardware's origins in African mines and Chinese factories to the strenuous manual and psychological labor hidden in the back-ends of many of our favorite online services.  Throughout, students will learn how seemingly unrelated changes share a common history.  The course will include several guest lecturers from academia and industry.  Students will be asked to write papers, do multimedia projects, and engage with their classmates in group projects."

Can film be a force for uncovering and popularizing \"hidden\" histories that upset our assumptions about the past?  This course takes a novel approach to less well-known chapters in history by looking at how films and documentaries can be tools for disseminating historical knowledge and how they can also be activist interventions in how we understand the past and its relationship to the society we live in today.  Throughout the course, we will watch films and documentaries that try to answer the questions posed above, and we will read historical accounts of the events they convey.  Students will learn how to write a short history from primary documents and then transfer it to an audio or a visual medium.

For decades the history of computing has been a collection of stories of \"great men\" and the machines they designed.  Yet, from the earliest days of computerization, women have played a major role in computing's history.  These stories have often been submerged, and historians have only recently begun to write them back into the main narrative of the history of computing.  Today, this is changing what we think we know about technology's past and how we see our own interactions with it.  In this course, students will look at the history of computing through the eyes of women pioneers -- some famous, some ordinary -- and discuss why we haven't heard very much about this history until now.  The class will help you better understand why gender, sexuality, and race play an important role in where computing has been and where it is going and, even more importantly, how technological change is interdependent with social categories."

An understanding of markets -- why they work, when they fail, and what lessons they offer for the design of environmental policies and the management of natural resources -- is central to an understanding of environmental issues.  But even before we start thinking about how markets work, it is useful to begin with a more basic question: What is environmental economics?  The historical evolution and current developments of market-based mechanisms to address environmental issues will be analyzed.  Lessons from environmental markets for acid rain and domestic and international greenhouse gas emissions will be discussed at length.  Other environmental markets (smog, renewable energy, water, sustainability indices, and biodiversity) will also be covered."

Finance/business students interested in trading, analytics, and financial risk management should pay attention to energy markets. In addition, some engineering/science students would like to widen their comfort zone to financial/commodity markets, which may be their future employers. Finally, this course is also for environmental management students who want to expand their comfort zone to finance and entrepreneurship students considering financial solutions for environmental/social problems. This three-credit course, designed for finance, business, engineering, science, environmental management, and entrepreneurship Master\u2019s or Upper-year Undergraduate students, introduces Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) investments and energy markets and provides a systematic exposition of data-driven analytic models for energy prices and other risk factors. First, this course introduces ESG investment and financial solutions for environmental/social problems because these are important current affairs in finance, are closely related to energy markets, and provide context to energy commodities. Then, this course provides an overview of (green) energy markets and well-designed instruction on energy commodity analytics. Through readings, lectures, discussion/analytic homework assignments, a presentation, and peer evaluations, students will understand the basics of these topics and develop expertise. As a part of a term project, a student will present: 1) His/her own proposal for an ESG fund; 2) A financial solution for a specific environmental/social problem of the student\u2019s choice; or 3) An energy commodity-related analytic research report carefully designed by the instructor. Even though finance people cannot do much for the COVID-19 pandemic, financiers can contribute to resolutions of environmental or social problems. If you propose an ESG fund, the proposal should recommend a procedure to pick stocks or other securities that will be in the master list of the fund. If you propose a financial solution for an environmental/social problem, you can propose a solution to governments or private-sector investors. After you finish this course, you can use the outcome to participate in an external competition such as Climate Investment Challenge (https://www.climateinvestmentchallenge.org/). If a student chooses the analytic research report, the student will work on a carefully-designed practical problem, gain hands-on experience in programming for trading and financial risk management, do a presentation, and can write a white paper if he/she wants. Students may use his/her presentation and supporting materials for his/her job search purposes. After the presentation, the students will provide constructive feedback to classmates through peer evaluation. At the end of this semester, students will be able to research, propose, and implement investment/trading/hedging strategies in energy markets and other ESG-related markets. The learning objectives of this course is related to the social and climate risk (SCR) certificate from the Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP). This course is a self-contained course which will help motivated, hard-working students develop themselves into a green/responsible/impact investment manager, an entrepreneur, a financial risk manager, an asset optimizer, a trader, a structuring and pricing analyst, a middle office analyst, a quantitative analyst, a data scientist, a quantitative programmer, etc."

Marketing activities are those processes and functions that enable managers and policy-makers to identify and serve the values and needs of a customer given the capacities of the company, activities of competitors, and inherent constraints in the business environment.  Marketers typically refer to these concepts as the \"four C's.\" Based on their understanding of the \"four C's,\" students will then learn how to implement strategy by applying the levers of the marketing mix.  These elements are known as the four P's (product, price, place/channels of distribution, and promotion).  The treatment of marketing constraints and marketing mix will be motivated by essential foundations from economics, sociology, and consumer behavior.  Over the course of the semester, students are expected to transition from thinking about these concepts in isolation to a dynamic, integrative framework.  This process includes using the marketing strategy framework to assess business and policy problems from a \"multiple objective\" perspective:  that is, the student will be asked to think about how marketing activities along with those of competitors and collaborators will affect the profitability, sustainability, social, and ethical standing of the firm.  The synthesis of these concepts will be carried out through the use of case studies, problem sets, classroom lectures, discussions, and a field project.  There will also be a midterm and final exam.  The pedagogical style of the course emphasizes the students' role in applying the concepts discussed in the lectures to the situations at hand.

For example:  \"Price\" becomes \"Price Policy\", value-in-use, and price discrimination; \"Product\" becomes product line breadth and variety and product life cycle choices; \"Place\" becomes the design and control of single or multiple channels of distribution; and \"Promotion\" becomes communications, customer loyalty, and brand equity.  The course will emphasize segmentation of the market, positioning the marketing mix to meet the needs of the market segment, sustaining an 'integrated' marketing mix over the product life cycle, and organizing the 'Strategic Business Unit' to implement the strategy.  In addition to the development of a marketing strategy that 'positions' the product/service to the needs of one or more target markets (segmentation), the execution of a marketing strategy will require a marketing plan that includes the economic and financial analysis of the costs and potential profits of the strategy and an implementation plan including an organizational structure.  This will often be an iterative process to find an optimal combination of costs and pricing and volume to maximize profits.

Analytical investigation of the techniques and methods of architectural design and representation are interwoven with an analytical investigation of site, place, inhabitation, and elemental spatial archetypes. The studio is largely comprised of two primary projects (Composite City and Inhabited Archetypes), with specific internal phases and deliverables, structured to operate as a complementary whole. Composite City comprises a series of studies in drawing, modeling and making that dissect the layers, components and phenomena of the built environment, via questions of narrative, memory, space, tectonics, systems and compositions. Inhabited Archetypes comprises a series of spatial explorations that employ the preceding analyses as sites of operation. Four archetypes (bridge, tower, wall, stair) prompt fundamental questions of architectural space (tectonics and inhabitation) and design processes. Working iteratively and comparatively, each archetype will be a medium to investigate issues of structure, skin, thickness, thinness, material, assembly, inhabitation and narrative.

Marketing activities are those processes and functions that enable managers and policy-makers to identify and serve the values and needs of a customer given the capacities of the company, activities of competitors, and inherent constraints in the business environment.  Marketers typically refer to these concepts as the \"four C's.\"  Based on their understanding of the \"four C's,\" students will then learn how to implement strategy by applying the levers of the marketing mix.  These elements are known as the four P's (product, price, place/channels of distribution, and promotion).  The treatment of marketing constraints and marketing mix will be motivated by essential foundations from economics, sociology, and consumer behavior.  Over the course of the semester, students are expected to transition from thinking about these concepts in isolation to a dynamic, integrative framework.  This process includes using the marketing strategy framework to assess business and policy problems from a \"multiple objective\" perspective:  that is, the student will be asked to think about how marketing activities along with those of competitors and collaborators will affect the profitability, sustainability, social, and ethical standing of the firm.  The synthesis of these concepts will be carried out through the use of case studies, problem sets, classroom lectures, discussions, and a field project.  There will also be a midterm and final exam.  The pedagogical style of the course emphasizes the students' role in applying the concepts discussed in the lectures to the situations at hand.

In addition to the development of a marketing stategy that positions the product/service to the needs of one or more target markets (segmentation), the execution of a marketing strategy will require a marketing plan that includes the economic and financial analysis of the costs and potential profits of the strategy and an implementation plan, including an organizational structure.  This will often be an iterative process to find an optimal combination of costs, pricing, and volume to maximize profits.  This course will use readings, simulations, and cases for about half its content.  The other half of the course will be a team consulting project for an external client."

Popular examples of general-purpose mathematical software include Python, MATLAB, R, Mathematica, Fortran, and the NAG Library.  Researchers often find themselves writing mathematical software to demonstrate their new ideas, or using mathematical software written by others to solve their applications.  Recently, the emergence of generative AI tools such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and Copilot can also assist in the prototyping of mathematical software. This course covers the ingredients as well as emerging opportunities and challenges in producing mathematical software that is efficient, robust, and trustworthy.

Furthermore, we will cover the data-warehouse paradigm including the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process, the data cube model and its relational representations (such as snowflake and star schema), and efficient processing of analytical queries.  This will be contrasted with Big Data analytics approaches that (besides other differences) significantly reduce the upfront cost of analytics.  When feeding data through complex processing pipelines such as data exchange transformations or ETL workflows, it is easy to lose track of the origin of data. Therefore, in the last part of the course we cover techniques for representing and keeping track of the origin and creation process of data (its provenance).\n\nThe course emphasizespractical skills through a series of homework assignments that help students develop a strong background in data integration systems and techniques.  At the same time, it also addresses the underlying formalisms.  For example, we will discuss the logic based languages used for schema mapping and the dimensional data model as well as their practical application (e.g., developing an ETL workflow with rapid miner and creating a mapping between two example schemata).

To explore the role of the judge, we will consider a number of questions, including the following: How do judges describe their role when they write or speak about it? How do empirical studies describe what judges do when social scientists and political scientists examine judges' verdicts or demographic characteristics? How is the judge's role portrayed in popular culture, including newspapers, movies, and television shows? This course will examine the different expectations that we have of judges. We also will consider what characteristics make for a good judge and what tools judges think they need in order to perform their job more effectively. Finally, we will look at judges in other countries to see how they perform their job and how they are regarded to see if judicial practices in other countries suggest any reforms that we might try in our own country.\n\nCredit Hours\nThree credit hours."

However, with the potential rewards of doing business in developing states come significant risks associated with navigating unstable political-economic systems and volatile regulatory frameworks. While cross border transactions in developed countries present myriad risks, many of the perils associated with projects in developing countries are more pronounced. Companies doing business in and with emerging market countries need to identify and manage political/economic risks and regulatory/legal risks that can destroy successful foreign direct investments and international trade projects. The type and scope of these risks vary by country and by project. Whereas a mining company extracting silver in Bolivia is exposed to expropriation risks, an international bank with branches in emerging markets might be more vulnerable to breaches of anti-money laundering regulations. As a U.S. exporter's risk analysis might focus on potential violations of international trade sanctions, global insurance companies are often more concerned about potential breaches of domestic and international anti-corruption laws. This course will introduce students to some of the risk analysis methods that multinational companies and their advisers use to identify the potential pitfalls of investing in emerging markets. These methods include but are not limited to political and economic risk analysis, reviews of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK's Bribery Act, identification of existing or future business practices that potentially violate international economic sanctions, and understanding how domestic and international anti-money laundering laws affect a parent company's subsidiaries around the world. International risk management tools safeguard multinational companies from significant losses that threaten the sustainability of cross border transactions in emerging market countries. This course will familiarize students with some of these risk management strategies. Examples of these tools include international trade and investment treaties, political risk and trade credit insurance, and in-house strategies and policies for managing exposures to financial crimes. \n\nCredit Hours\nTwo credit hours."

This course will provide students with a grounding in the ethical rules governing the legal profession with a special focus on the challenges presented by these developments in law practice. E-Discovery, electronic communications, and document recognition software are fundamentally altering not only the work that big law firms do but how they price it. Corporate clients are demanding changes to price structures as they grow increasingly unwilling to pay for any lawyer who is not already experienced or whose work can be performed adequately by a computer or a paralegal. Comparably, the commodification of routine legal documents for smaller, less complicated transactions, is allowing non-lawyers to perform many of the services traditionally performed by lawyers. Attorneys serving the market for personal legal services and small businesses need to learn how to provide and explain the unique value that they can provide as lawyers. Meanwhile, legal services agencies that serve low-income people are using technology vastly to increase the number of clients served. These technological innovations and the ways in which they affect the pricing of legal services inevitably affect lawyers' ethical obligations, particularly with regard to marketing, confidentiality and conflicts of interest. This course will draw on regional and national experts to help explain how technological change affects how law firms operate and then help students learn to anticipate next steps in the ethical delivery of legal services.

        "course_description": "This course explores the past, present, and future role of lawyers as architects of social innovation. It also provides students with practical experience in serving as counselors to social enterprises. Lawyers representing nonprofits and businesses with a social purpose alike (as both in-house and outside counsel) play an increasingly important role as legal, business, and strategic advisers who not only protect the interests of the organization, but who also creatively contribute as productive members of business, operations, and program teams. This course will explore the roles, responsibilities, and practical considerations these attorneys manage.\n\nThe guidance and tools that lawyers provide their social enterprise clients will be a core focus of the course. The course will also explore emerging areas for social innovation, including new and hybrid organizational structures, innovative financing mechanisms, and considerations unique to charities engaged in increasingly popular cross-sector partnerships - from donor intent to cause marketing to social investment approaches. Taught from the perspective of an in-house attorney for a global charity that works around the world on multiple initiatives with diverse cross-sector partners, this course will introduce students to the most commonly addressed issues and most frequently used tools and approaches for developing, implementing, and assessing new and dynamic social enterprises.\n\nAs an experiential component, the course will allow students to take on the role of a client that has developed a new idea for a social enterprise and to also serve as counsel that provides both practical tools and strategic program guidance to these endeavors. Students will develop the ability to properly assess and advise on legal and business issues, effectively offer guidance, and develop skills in utilizing the most commonly used tools, approaches, and insights necessary to help organizations build sustainable operations and impactful programs.\n\nThis course counts as an elective course toward the Public Interest Law Certificate and the Praxis Certificate. Students who wish to apply the course toward one of these certificates may not take this course Pass/Fail.\n\nCredit Hours\nTwo credit hours."

Over the past thirty years a rich and exciting body of scholarship regarding gender and the law has developed. It poses a significant challenge to traditional ways of thinking about law, questioning some of the basic premises of what constitutes justice and equality in a democracy. This course examines the main tenets, methodologies, and controversies in this body of literature including the meaning of equality, the intersection of race and law, the public/private divide, concepts of objectivity and neutrality, and how law reproduces hierarchies while also having the ability to participate in significant social change. We will also analyze debates regarding sex work, domestic violence, reproductive rights, the nature of the workplace, and concepts of the family. The goal of the course is to think broadly and critically regarding the interaction of law, society, and gender while exploring the potential and limitations of our legal system."

This constant roller coaster of deregulation and regulation makes being a transportation attorney very exciting. This course will briefly describe the different modes of transportation and the regulating bodies for each. We will be focusing our class on the surface modes of transportation, namely trucking and rail. The main topics discussed will be contracts, tariffs, liability for loss and damage to cargo, tort liability of shippers, carriers, customers, and brokers during and after the transportation of freight and a comprehensive understanding of insurance and the various policy forms that exist."

The reason is simple: In June 1958, the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards was signed and has now been adopted by over 100 countries, including all the major commercial countries. This Convention ensures that an arbitral award, rendered anywhere in the world, will be enforced in the courts of the signatory countries. Judgments of courts do not receive this treatment: court awards are very difficult to enforce in other countries. Students will gain a working knowledge of the various international treaties which provide the structure of international commercial arbitration. The course will explore the ways in which arbitrations can be structured: either ad hoc or under the umbrella of an international organization. The course will examine several umbrella organizations and their \"Rules,\" including The American Arbitration Association, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC \u00bf Paris), The London Court of International Arbitration, UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law), the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, and UNCITRAL's Convention for the International Sale of Goods.

In 1828 James Fenimore Cooper, an American born commentator on American life, took note of the burgeoning population growth and projected that in one hundred years America's population might reach \"near or quite 100 million.\" Continue Cooper, \"the first impression that strike the mind is the impossibility that 100 million people should consent to live quietly under the same government.\" Today's population, of course, is not only much larger but is far more diverse than Cooper imagined. One of the reasons our country has been able to grow and still remain united, ironically, is that under our federal system much political power is decentralized at the state, local, and other subfederal levels. And that is what this course is about: the decentralization of power. The course explores the conflicts inherent in the allocation of power between the national, state, and local governments. It tries to answer questions like: Why do we still have states? What are the maximal powers that states and local governments have, and should have, to create environments that both shape and reflect their citizens' desires? In answering these and related questions the course will look to both law and political theory. Explored in detail will be many of the constitutional doctrines that define our country's federal structure. Also examined will be vital doctrines concerning local government formation and annexation, statutory and home rule powers, the relationships between local governments (including city : suburb), participation in local government, as well as important issues in taxation and finance."

The Supreme Court case focusing on maternity leave raised the question whether women should be arguing for equality or difference; Toni Morrison's novel The Bluest Eye asks a similar question. Catharine MacKinnon and Carol Gilligan gave the debate a slightly different turn, with MacKinnon focusing on the need to rectify an existing power imbalance and Gilligan emphasizing an appreciation of difference. Both these approaches intersect in Gloria Naylor's The Women of Brewster Place and Cristina Garcia's Dreaming in Cuban.

        "course_description": "This course is designed as a general introduction to the legal system of the European Union (EU). It covers both its constitutional and institutional structure and focuses on specific key areas of substantive law. The course starts by introducing the EU's legal order, and then moves briefly into the EU's legislative process, where it concentrates on the political and legislative functions of the various institutions and the division of competences between the EU and its Member States. The course pays particular attention to the role of the judiciary in shaping the EU's legal order. The European Court of Justice developed the fundamental notions of direct effect and supremacy of European law. Those notions, through which rights are created for European citizens, are examined, and the course subsequently turns to how those rights can be enforced. The area of European Trade Law is then chosen as a 'test case' to analyse the legal, political and social developments of the European system. In particular, the provisions on free movements, competition, and state aids are thoroughly analysed with reference to the case law of the European Court of Justice and to relevant secondary legislation. This part of the course, by focusing also on specific issues such as the tension between market forces and values (public health, European culture, and social prerogatives), is not confined to legal themes only but indirectly examines the role of the EU and the values and polices upon which the European constitutional architecture is founded. Therefore, although the course is not a comparative one, a discussion on the US and EU institutional and judicial system is warmly welcome in each lecture. Three credit hours."

In the age of online marketplaces, where consumers can\u2019t touch and feel a product, the appearance of a product is often pivotal in the consumer\u2019s purchasing decision. Increasingly, the aesthetic appearance of products is a leading driver of sales. All of this interest begs the question: How are product appearances protected and enforced under existing intellectual property laws? This class studies the various intellectual rights used to protect design under U.S. law, including trade dress, design patents and copyright law. The course will also briefly consider sui generis design rights, as exemplified by the European Union design right, which have for many years been proposed for introduction in the United States. No prior IP course or knowledge is required or expected to enroll in the course. Three credit  hours."

(The Capstone Experience requirement may also be satisfied by participation in the Intellectual Property Law \u00bf Patent Clinic, or the completion of an Intellectual Property Externship). The course may be taken only by J.D. students enrolled in the Intellectual Property Certificate Program. It is intended to be taken in the last year of legal studies. This is a problem-solving course that will bring together learning from different intellectual property courses and from non-intellectual property courses, bringing home the inter-relationships between different bodies of law and asking students to apply that knowledge to a concrete problem faced by a fictional client. The course will be taught by several faculty members. During some class meetings, the class will meet as a group. Between these \"team\" meetings, the class will break into smaller groups (of approximately 8-12 students). These smaller groups will work with teams of two faculty in researching and discussing particular parts of the overall problem, will make oral reports to other members of the small group, and after the small group decides on the appropriate strategy will make oral and brief written reports to the entire class. The entire class will then discuss how best to advise the client to proceed and how best to effectuate the social and commercial objectives of the client. The course is intended to allow students to develop an appreciation of the contexts in which intellectual property problems arise, how to apply knowledge developed in intellectual property and other courses to a concrete problem, the considerations (legal and non-legal) that guide how lawyers approach those problems, and the real-life dynamics that affect the practice of intellectual property law. The class will be graded on a pass/fail basis, based upon performance in class (both when the entire class is present and in small groups) and based upon oral and written presentations."

It raises deep issues of federalism and justice as well as real-world problems of how to make governments accountable to their citizens without undermining their effectiveness. Thousands of constitutional torts cases are filed annually, and they generate considerable controversy, e.g., Rodney King filed a section 1983 damages action against Los Angeles and certain of its police officers. Those who should take this course include persons who expect to do federal litigation of any kind, as well as any students who hope to clerk for federal or state judges or work for state and local governments.

In this course, we will attempt to answer these and other questions by considering the relationship between legal and political philosophy, showing how the former is incomplete without the latter. Taking the problem of how to solve difficult cases as our point of departure, we will look at the inherent incompleteness of conventional theories of law with the idea of developing a meta-theory that would enable judges to decide difficult cases by drawing upon the best available theory of politics appropriate to the case's level of abstraction. By so doing, it is hoped that we will be able to produce resolutions for some kinds of controversial cases and open doors to the way we should think about others. It is also hoped that the course will provide an avenue for a broad critique of the way legal and political institutions operate including the way law schools educate and judges actually decide cases."

However, it does so from a practice standpoint - how to analyze a client's situation, how to determine the best route to permanent resident status for a particular client, what resources are available, and how to navigate the maze of the Immigration Service and determine which form needs to be used, and where to file it. We will also examine the temporary statuses available to persons seeking to enter the U.S. to work or study, also from a practice standpoint. There are no prerequisites, but we strongly recommend that you have previously taken an Immigration Law class or have practical experience in immigration law.

Three credit hours                                                 .\n[Prof. Samar's section] Despite important recent changes at the local, state, and national levels, and in some foreign countries and the European Union, to protect gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgendered persons (LGBT) from discrimination and to recognize same-sex relationships, society's attitude toward homosexuality and transgendered issues continues to be ambivalent. This is especially true in respect to marriage and child rearing, as we see in the current debates over same-sex marriage, but it is also found in the attitudes of states that fail to protect against public and private employment discrimination, and in the federal government's \"Don't Ask/Don't Tell\" policy to keep openly gay persons from serving in the military. This course/seminar will explore the possibility of finding a legal, philosophical or political framework for approaching LGBT issues by critically looking at various conceptions of homosexuality and society's purported justifications for affecting this behavior, against its broader concerns for guaranteeing social liberty and human equality. It will then apply this understanding to the interaction between gays and the criminal justice system; discrimination in public employment (including military service) and private employment; first amendment issues posed by gay teachers in public schools and universities; the legal problems faced in establishing same-sex relationships (especially\nmarriage) in Massachusetts and elsewhere; and the legal problems gay people confront in matters pertaining to child custody and visitation rights. Central to the course will be locating possible interpretations for the Supreme Court's 2003 interpretation in Lawrence v. Texas, and its 1996 decision in Romer v. Texas. This particular area of the law is really several areas as they relate to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgendered people. LGBT have been a kind of exception to the way the law traditionally operates, and this exception cannot usually be made sense of in terms of traditional legal thinking. For this reason the course will engage a certain degree of theoretical abstraction to undersand, clarify and hopefuly improve the law in these areas. Two credit hours."

While law school does a marvelous job training students to find the law, it has ignored the vital role lawyers play in discovering the facts. This role has garnered much attention lately as lawyers have been accused of breaching ethical duties thru techniques, such as pretexting, used in the Hewlett-Packard scandal. While criminal litigators have focused extensively on this role, civil lawyers also do a great deal of investigating. Lawyers will do more of these as more regulation is imposed on corporate America thru legislation, such as Sarbanes Oxley. Accordingly, students will learn how to: (1) develop physical evidence; (2) conduct interviews and interrogations; (3) process physical evidence; (4) retrieve electronic evidence; (5) use investigators and experts; and (6) utilize formal discovery. Students will be required to develop two investigation plans - one for a criminal case, one for a civil case. Students will also be required to do several presentations to the class.

Second, studying how other legal systems deal with various substantive and procedural issues can provide useful insights for how those issues might be better dealt with in our legal system. The premise of this course is that the benefits of studying comparative law can be best obtained by focusing on a specific area of law, which however encompasses issues and doctrines that are fundamental to all of law.

It allows students to rotate through three in-house clinics exposing them to three distinct practice areas and lawyering styles. Students enrolled in the Clinic Rotation will spend four weeks with each of the three practice areas led by an in-house clinical faculty member/attorney. Practice areas include criminal defense, employment/civil litigation, entrepreneurial law, family law, health and disability law, and tax and probate law. During each four-week rotation, students may be given the opportunity to gain exposure to the inner workings of a law practice and they may be exposed to or participate in any of the following: legal and factual research, client interview simulations, document drafting, discovery review, simulations of administrative hearings and negotiations, trial strategy sessions, and observation of court and motion calls. Due to the differences among the practice areas and the nature of the practice of law, student experiences will vary between practice areas and individual rotations.\n\nStudents will be required to put in a total of 112 hours over the course of the semester. This includes weekly attendance for 14 weeks at a two-hour plenary session (28 hours total), which will expose students to various aspects of practice, lawyering ethics, and law offices management. Students will spend their remaining 84 hours (seven hours a week) during the 3 Clinical Rotations working independently, in groups, and in collaboration with the clinical faculty members, including a weekly two-hour group discussion session taught by the clinical professor to whom they have been assigned for the four-week period. The three four-week Clinical Rotations will end after the 13th week of the semester.\n\nThe weekly plenary sessions will meet on Thursdays from 1:55 to 3:45 pm. The weekly group discussion sessions with individual clinical professors will meet either Tuesdays 4:00-5:50pm or Thursdays 4:00-5:50pm (depending on the professor).

The duty to obey law presupposes that laws are both consistent and just: because they sometime aren't, difficult cases arise in which appeals to a higher political morality become necessary if justice is to be served. But what is this higher political morality and what is its connection to the institutions we rely upon to do justice and protect our human rights as well as to the laws that are actually produced? Is this higher political morality the morality of our society or something broader? And, if it is something broader, how do we discover what it is? In this course, we will attempt to answer these and other questions by considering the relationship between legal and political philosophy, showing how the former is incomplete without the latter. Taking the problem of how to solve difficult cases as our point of departure, we will look at the inherent incompleteness of conventional theories of law with the idea of developing a meta-theory that would enable judges to decide difficult cases by drawing upon the best available theory of politics appropriate to the case's level of abstraction. By so doing, it is hoped that we will be able to produce resolutions for some kinds of controversial cases and open doors to the way we should think about others. It is also hoped that the course will provide an avenue for a broad critique of the way legal and political institutions operate including the way law schools educate and judges actually decide cases."

This seminar will explore and contrast the basic premises of classical liberal legal theory and the various critical theories. Is classical liberal legal theory morally agnostic? Do the critical theorists espouse certain moral values and principles and, if so, can they consistently do so while claiming to be anti-foundation lists? To what extent do the moral values and principles ( if any) espoused by the critical theorists differ from those (if any ) espoused by classical liberal theory ?."

Moreover, and for similar reasons, labor advocates increasingly seek to hold countries accountable for failing to live up to international labor standards promulgated by the International Labor Organization (ILO) and other international bodies. They also try to hold lead firms that manage global value chains accountable to workers based on public and private sources of law, including corporate codes of conduct. Reformers also look at the labor and employment laws of other countries when they try to improve their national systems. International and comparative labor and employment law is therefore more than an academic curiosity. It is an important aspect of law practice and policy-making. In light of these considerations, this course surveys labor and employment laws and norms developed and promulgated by the ILO, the European Union, free trade agreements, and corporate codes. Comparatively, the course also focuses on the laws of the United States, Germany, and China, three leading world economies with vastly different labor and employment law systems. While the course does not aim to make students \"experts\" in any one jurisdiction, it teaches students to make informed questions, including to local counsel, when they encounter cross-border, employment-related legal issues. The course will also guide students to understand why countries have different systems of labor and employment protection despite the fact that they all try to solve similar problems, and how the U.S. is, or is not, unique.\n\nCredit Hours\nTwo credit hours."

This course/seminar will explore the possibility of finding a legal, philosophical or political framework for approaching LGBT issues by critically looking at various conceptions of homosexuality and society\u00bfs purported justifications for affecting this behavior, against its broader concerns for guaranteeing social liberty and human equality. It will then apply this understanding to the interaction between gays and the criminal justice system; discrimination in public employment (including military service) and private employment; first amendment issues posed by gay teachers in public schools and universities; the legal problems faced in establishing same-sex relationships (especially\nmarriage) in Massachusetts and elsewhere; and the legal problems gay people confront in matters pertaining to child custody and visitation rights.

This particular area of the law is really several areas as they relate to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgendered people.

        "course_description": "This seminar will focus on the role that is properly played by non-judicial institutions (primarily Congress and the President) in determining what the Constitution requires.  For example:  May the President elect not to enforce federal law because he thinks doing so would be unconstitutional?  When Congress and the President formulate their positions as to what the Constitution means, are they limited to using the same reasoning that courts use, or may they take account of additional considerations? Our study will have the added benefit of clarifying the role that courts play in interpreting the Constitution.  It also will shed light on what the Constitution \u00bfis,\u00bf what role the Constitution plays in our democratic liberal regime, and how the Constitution changes over time.  We will approach these issues by reading historical materials, constitutional jurisprudence, and several case studies.  Possible topics include (1) national security issues, primarily the relation between the President's commander-in-chief powers and Congress' assorted war-making powers; (2) the constitutionality of secession; (3) the impeachment process; (4) executive privilege; and (5) equal protection.  Students will be expected to write a paper.  Prerequisite: Constitutional Law."

Claim construction\u2014the process of interpreting the claims at the end of the patent that define the patent's scope\u2014is the most important issue in patent litigation. It is a threshold step to virtually every issue in a patent case, including invalidity and infringement. Claims also must be construed by a variety of actors outside of litigation: patent examiners, competitors, researchers, and the patentees themselves. A good understanding of claim construction is thus crucial to being a successful patent practitioner, whether one is a litigator, prosecutor, or transactional lawyer. In addition to readings and discussions, the seminar will include a practical component tracking the claim construction process under the patent local rules used by many district courts. Assessment will be primarily based on the work product generated as part of this claim construction simulation, as well as a paper addressing a significant policy issue related to claim construction. Prerequisite: Patent Law completed or taken concurrently; or permission of instructor.\n\nCredit Hours\nTwo credit hours."

Through an examination of major episodes from American history, students will be exposed to central themes of constitutional development: the concept of a written constitution, judicial review, the balance of power between the central government and the states, the problem of slavery and racial equality, free speech, gender equality, and the role of law in shaping cultural norms. Although much of the course is dedicated to analyzing the ways in which the courts, particularly the United States Supreme Court, have interpreted and applied the Constitution, we will also give close attention to the efforts of individuals and groups outside the judiciary to shape the Constitution and define its role in American society. \n\nCredit Hours\nThree credit hours."

        "course_description": "This seminar is a unique multi-school class taught by weekly live lecture from St John\u2019s Law School in New York and simultaneously telecast to several other participating institutions nationwide, including Chicago-Kent. The seminar is offered under the auspices of the American College of Bankruptcy. The lectures are given by leading bankruptcy judges, practitioners and academics, and satellite classrooms will be equipped with live question-and-answer capability. Professor Walters will host the Chicago-Kent classroom, meaning he will contribute to the curriculum and be responsible for supervising and evaluating your seminar papers. He will be joined for Spring 2016 by the Honorable Judge Timothy A. Barnes of the US Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Because of the need to synchronize with other participating law schools, the class will meet on Tuesdays from 5.30-7.30pm CT, commencing Tuesday January 20, 2016, for the duration of the Spring semester. There are no prerequisites for the class, and while familiarity with basic U.S. bankruptcy law is useful, there will be an opportunity to study or review U.S. business bankruptcy law at an introductory level. The seminar offers an introduction to some of the jurisdictional problems that arise when international corporations become insolvent. International corporations typically have assets and subsidiaries in multiple jurisdictions. When financial distress occurs, a troubled corporation and its subsidiaries may therefore file for bankruptcy in several different jurisdictions with significantly different bankruptcy procedures. It is therefore essential that modern bankruptcy lawyers have at least a basic understanding of the distinctive features of foreign bankruptcy regimes. Additionally, even if a corporation and its subsidiaries file for bankruptcy in a single jurisdiction, the courts in that jurisdiction will often need the assistance of courts in foreign jurisdictions in order to protect the corporation's assets and consummate a successful reorganization or liquidation. It is therefore important for modern bankruptcy lawyers to understand the scope for international cooperation between courts and practitioners and the international legal instruments that seek to foster such cooperation. The first half of this class identifies the basic contours of the world's major bankruptcy regimes, including the laws of the United States, United Kingdom, China, Japan, Canada, and of various Latin American and Western European countries. During the second half, we study the major legal frameworks for international assistance and cooperation in cross-border bankruptcies (Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the European Union\u2019s Insolvency Regulation). We also discuss the opportunities for foreign nationals to use U.S. Bankruptcy Law (particularly Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code) to pursue a reorganization in the United States. Instructors: Each class will be taught by one or more visiting instructors. Technical Aspects: The course will originate at St John\u2019s Law School and be telecast to the other participating. Students at the other schools will be able to see and hear the instructor and ask questions in real time. Students are evaluated and graded by professors at their home institutions. At Chicago-Kent, students will work on a substantial research paper and a series of short (2\u20133 page) analysis papers.\n\nCredit Hours\nTwo credit hours."

Alleged harassers include CEOs, C-suite executives, senior management, supervisors, lower-level managers, co-workers, bystanders, and third parties. Such allegations threaten the brands and often the very survival of employers. This course, taught by a co-editor of the 2018 Bloomberg Workplace Harassment Law (second edition), will explore landmark cases and cutting-edge issues in an increasingly diverse workplace. Three credit hours."
