The course will focus on various traditional and popular musics of India, Africa, Indonesia, and the Middle East. Special focus will be given to ways of thinking about music that fall outside of the standard conceptions of Western music. This includes West African concepts of time in music, which are often cyclical rather than linear, or the Indian raga, which is an abstract concept with no Western analog that defines many fundamental aspects about how a song is performed. Specific topics will include Indian Bollywood film music, Indonesian puppet theatre (Wayang kulit), and West African storytelling music of the Griot. This course will also examine basic concepts surrounding ethnomusicology: the academic field involving the study of music in its cultural context. What are some common ethnographic methods for studying a culture and their music? What are the implications of the roles of outsider and insider with regards to a music and its surrounding culture?

In so doing we analyze their multiple dimensions as territorial entities, legal demarcations, institutions, sites and symbols of power, racial and ethnic boundaries, liminal spaces, and metaphorical constructs. As we gain deeper understanding we will see that borders, no matter what form they may take, are used to separate nations, people, spaces, in such a way that difference is imbued with power. Course readings engage scholars from multiple disciplines including anthropology, geography, history, political science, and sociology, with cases studies from around the globe including Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the U.S. "

The first goal is to identify and make sense of what a racial capitalist critique and analysis of power in U.S. society offers us other radical and progressive frameworks such as liberalism or traditional Marxist approaches do not. The second goal is to apply what we\u2019ve learned in studying racial capitalism in the U.S. by looking at examples of how communities have and are currently building movements that address, confront, and resist forms of racial capitalism and its persistence in the U.S."

It was informed by the Evangelical Protestantism created in the Second Great Awakening, and mediated by an explosion in print culture that turned the United States into a \u201cnation of readers.\u201d In addition, it was generated by market and industrial revolutions that fostered the emergence of a new middle class - one empowered to act as a cultural force and determined to bring \u201corder\u201d to society.

This course focuses on the geological aspects of marine science, as well as how geological concepts inform and are informed by chemistry, biology and physics. Geologic processes shape the ocean floor, continental margins, and coastlines, all of which serve as key sources of energy and material flux to the oceans.  The coastlines also represent some of the most critical zones where humans are impacted by marine geohazards and the availability natural resources. This course will focus on the primary geologic processes that influence the structure of the earth, on large and small scales, and that contribute to the physical and chemical make-up of the earth\u2019s crust, marine sediment environment, deep oceans and coastal zones. It will include discussions about critical problems that intertwine the human existence with marine geological issues such as climate change and natural hazards. Through case studies, lab exercises, and exposure to contemporary research, students will explore complex geologic environments where hazards, resources, and ecological hotspots are influenced by geodynamic or sediment transport processes such as subduction zones, ridge and hydrothermal systems, continental shelves and estuaries. They will practice observational and data analysis techniques that are used to characterize the evolving features of climate change and increasing human impacts to the global and local Salish Sea environments."

In this course, students will build intuition about physical oceanographic processes by tying the theory of fluid dynamics to concrete examples; case studies will include oil spills, red tide in the Pacific Northwest, and coastal hypoxia. Discussion about these critical problems will focus on how they intertwine with anthropogenic influences and human society. Particular attention will be paid to physical processes relevant to the coastal waters of the Pacific Northwest, such as estuarine circulation, upwelling, and tidal dynamics. Students will participate in at least one local field trip, during which they will collect physical oceanographic data for the class to analyze. As part of and in preparation for the field trip, the course will address on how the processes studied in class are measured.

Environmental sociologists have long been on the forefront of trying to understand how people willingly and unwillingly contribute and respond to climate change (mitigation and adaptation). Among the many topics environmental sociologists have addressed include public opinion (specifically climate change denial), individual and corporate behavior, climate activism and social movements, climate migration and loss of communities, energy concerns, ways of knowing about the environment and change (specifically indigenous knowledges) and broader issues of climate justice or how climate change will impact the most vulnerable around the world (indigenous, elderly, poverty stricken or homeless, BIPOC, queer, women, regional/non-Western differences and the disabled).

The presence of animals is difficult to ignore given the varied physical (food, fiber, entertainment, technology, laboratory, companion, etc.) and representational (symbol, story, religious, etc.) places animals inhabit in human lives. This course brings into focus the historic and contemporary role animals have played and highlights the importance of recognizing and investigating these relationships as drivers of human attitudes and behaviors. We will explore a variety of cases where animals have fundamentally altered how humans behave. For example, we will study the ways that people\u2019s attachments to their companion animals influenced their decisions to evacuate during Hurricane Katrina, leading to widespread changes in national evacuation policies. This class will draw on diverse voices (those from women, indigenous folk, LGBTQIA+ people, disabled, immigrants, etc.) to demonstrate how various communities have been writing and thinking about the connection between animals, people and the natural environment. Course materials will include academic and activist texts, film, photography, art, and national and international guest speakers."

Specifically, we will discuss how gender, class, race and power mediate human and environmental interactions and what this means for human health and well-being. Particular attention will be paid to how environmental destruction and contamination impacts the lives of women, LBGTQ+ folks, BIPOC, and the disabled. We will also explore how individuals from these communities have been at the forefront of the environmental justice movement. This course will also involve having students assess their water, air, and soil quality in comparison to other regions of the country and world.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s a group of sociologists challenged the field to include societal-environmental interactions. They started from the premise that sociology had been established and was driven by human exceptionalism, viewing humans as categorically different from all other life and therefore immune from many environmental forces. They argued that society could not be properly understood without recognizing the natural environment. From this critique, environmental sociology emerged as a sub-discipline. The environmental sociologist seeks to understand the social foundations of environmental issues, asking questions about how consumption patterns, technologies, production systems, population changes, power dynamics, religion, and culture affect the emergence of, and reactions to, environmental problems. Environmental sociologists are also interested in how risks and harms are distributed across societies and produce environmental inequalities (environmental justice). This class will take a historical and applied approach to showcase the past, present and future of the sub-discipline as it relates to contemporary issues like biodiversity loss, climate change, pollution, and new energy technologies. Course materials will include academic and activist texts, film, photography, and art."

However, most basic analytic frameworks (such as Ordinary Least Squares regression) are ill-suited to accurately representing associations between characteristics measured at different levels, which makes it difficult to account for the impacts of social context on individual or group outcomes. Hierarchical or Multilevel Linear Regression models (HLMs) allow researchers to simultaneously assess social relationships involving theoretically relevant characteristics across multiple units of analysis.

In this course, we will closely read, respond to, and analyze a wide range of texts in order to gain some understanding of how comics are situated in historical, cultural, social, and political contexts. Students will exercise and refine textual and cultural analysis skills by examining how an author utilizes context, form, visual cues, language, and other elements of sequential art."
