This process had political, economic, military, social, and cultural dimensions, and it was one that westerners resisted as often as they welcomed it. By the end of the nineteenth century, the West had emerged as an identifiable region of the U.S., with regional economic features, unique ties to the federal government, distinctive patterns of race relations, and a unique place in U.S. cultural memory. Throughout, we will attend to the aspirations of a variety of western peoples: people of all genders; workers and captains of industry; sexual majorities and sexual minorities; people of North American, Latin American, European, African, and Asian origin or descent. We look at how the varied aspirations of such peoples both clashed and coalesced, sometimes producing dissension and violence, and other times producing new social movements. Using films, monographs, memoirs, letters, academic articles and literary fiction, we will explore the struggle for land, resources, identity, and power, all of which have characterized \u201cThe West\u201d and its role in the history of the United States."

Yet art and aesthetics can also serve as powerful vehicles of critique and disobedience\u2013sometimes attacking these very foundations, museums, and institutions, in addition to government and other individuals and bodies of power\u2013in any given community or polity. In this course we will explore this double nature of art as both civil and disobedient. Readings will include authors and aesthetic genres from groups and geographic locations historically underrepresented in philosophy. Topics include race representation, gender identity, and class difference; classicism, modernism, and postmodernism; street art, kitsch, junkyards, jokes, and mass art, among others."

Even after independence, European countries continued to exert significant political and economic power in African countries, and African communities continued to live with the racialized global inequities that colonialism produced. In recent decades, Africans have been asserting the ongoing need for \u201cdecolonization\u201d or liberation in areas spanning African literature, international political economy, museums, global public health, and the university.

Africa and Africans greatly shaped and were shaped by World War II, and yet narratives of the worldwide conflict largely erase Africa.\u00a0 Historians of Africa have recently begun to address this issue anew, showing the importance of understanding the role of the approximately one million sub-Saharan African soldiers in the war as well as the vital role that Africans played in supplying materials and production for the Allied war effort.\u00a0 Africans performed this work as colonial subjects to European powers and their participation also raised vital questions about the ideals of self-determination and the defeat of tyranny for which the Allied effort fought.\u00a0 Moreover, the experience of the war brought great change in African societies, catalyzing new arrangements of economies, gender relations, political aspirations, and anti-colonial activism. This course examines these themes by drawing on new scholarship by historians, as well as primary sources and films. We will explore the question of how a focus on Africa can enhance historical understanding of World War II and, in turn, how a focus on World War II can enhance our historical understanding of Africa."

How have Black populations responded to the formation of those hierarchies? How have these hierarchies informed the lived realities of Black people in the United States and across the globe? How have these issues been addressed in higher education? Africana Studies is a scholarly field that answers these questions and many more by interrogating the role of race \u2013 and, in particular, Blackness and whiteness \u2013 in the structuring of society, identity, culture, power, and history.\u00a0We will approach our exploration of Africana Studies through an interdisciplinary framework that consists of historical documents, poetry, literary essays, memoir and novel excerpts, short stories, current event pieces, documentary segments, historical and contemporary interview footage, and more. We will begin with the 18th\u00a0century and move through to our current moment. On our journey to today, we will cover topics as varied as the impact of the public work of Frederick Douglass and the private work of his wife, Anna Murray Douglass; the community activism of the Black Panther Party; natural hair movements across the globe; and the Black Lives Matter Movement. We will conclude by examining the ever-urgent project(s) of Africana Studies today, as we live within the reverberations of centuries of violent anti-Blackness\u00a0and\u00a0the vibrant Black traditions of resistance, resilience, and joy formed in spite of, and in the midst of, that violence. While we only have one semester to unpack the legacies of centuries, by the end of our time together, you will be able to explain the significance of Africana Studies; the powerful ways it intertwines scholarship and activism; all that it reveals to us about the world from which we came; and, ultimately, all that it can teach us about the world we hope to build."

They stand in the center with drinks in hand (many drinks) as the twin pillars of prose Modernism in America, foundational writers in every sense of the term, widely influential, helping to define the shape of the novel and short story in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries. Both were at the height of their artistic power in the 1920s and 30s helping define the period and name the post-war \u201clost generation.\u201d Along with other writers like Joyce and Stein, they put Paris on the literary map. And they were both expatriates, self-exiled to an old Europe that proved extremely fertile as an artistic environment to foreign writers. It\u2019s probably not an exaggeration to say that Hemingway invented the Caf\u00e9 as Writing Zone, the Starbucks of the 1920s. Although he lived abroad, Fitzgerald was more influential at home and in New York City where he and his wife became the poster kids of the 1920s, writing about, wildly living and epitomizing the era. And yet like Keats & Shelley, Hemingway & Fitzgerald are profoundly different writers with different philosophies and aesthetic styles. As we\u2019ll see in this course, they stake out the poles in the spectrum of modernist writing. One reason for this, I will hazard upfront, is their early experience with and relationship to World War I. We\u2019ll learn more about their experiences by reading extracts from their two biographies. We\u2019ll also study a number of historical texts that place our authors in the essential contexts of World War I and the \u201cRoaring Twenties.\u201d These two authors were so essentially products of their time that it\u2019s impossible to get a complete sense of their work without some knowledge of the vital social and cultural background."

During the spring semester, we will spend our time reading and discussing Irish plays, fiction, poetry and nonfiction, in order to develop an understanding of the cultural identity that informs a contemporary sense of Irishness. We will also work to build an ensemble, learn the basics of creative writing, and develop the needed analytic skills demanded of revision in the arts. The course will weave together the arts of performance and writing by focusing on the first person point-of-view in fiction, poetry and nonfiction writing and stage drama. In Ireland, we will turn our attention to the development of original work. The course will culminate in a public performance of original writing in the Aran Islands. During our stay in western Ireland, we will, in addition, attend performances, readings, literary events, films, and engage with other embodied cultural practices. We will also engage with the landscape and unique histories of the country through a number of excursions. No previous experience in creative writing or theater required."

We will introduce students to a variety of genres: creative non-fiction, fiction, and poetry, and explore various interrelated literary traditions: nature writing, travel writing, exploration literature, adventure literature, epistolary accounts, and travel journaling. We will encourage students to become native informants-exploring what it means to live in a particular time, place, culture, and body-and curious explorers, letting negative capability (the power of not knowing) lead them into unexpected and unmapped territory. While inventing, shaping, and honing our creative writing, we will explore the poetics of place, the politics of space, and the historical and cultural significance of particular sites. The topic of place puts us at the intersection of identity and community, the boundaries of subjectivity and otherness, ontology and eschatology (Where did we come from? Where are we going?).

While our explorations will center primarily around novels, memoirs, short stories, and essays published in the twenty-first century, we will be in constant conversation with African American literature of the past, as the rich historical traditions of the field have provided the foundation upon which contemporary African American literature stands.

As we immerse ourselves in novels, short stories, memoirs, essays, and more by African American authors, we will ask ourselves the following questions \u2013 among others that we will dream up together: How do we decide \u2013 and who decides \u2013 which texts and authors are considered part of the African American literary tradition? Are Black authors who were born abroad but now live in the United States considered part of that tradition? What roles have gender, sexuality, complexion, and class played in establishing the \u201cmost famous\u201d African American literary texts? What would it mean to center narratives by communities that are so often pushed to the margins, such as queer African American communities or disabled African American communities? What do our twenty-first century texts have in common with nineteenth-century texts and events? How does African American literature influence contemporary culture, activism, and social justice movements? For example, what is the relationship between contemporary African American literature and the Black Lives Matter Movement? As we examine these questions and create new ones, we will move together through a literary tradition as vast as it is extraordinary, absorbing as much as we can of the resilience, beauty, complexity, and creativity that African American authors have gifted to the world for centuries \u2013 and that they continue to gift us with today. Together, we will examine the rich and multi-faceted traditions on which contemporary African American literature is founded, the dynamic present it continues to reflect and create, and the just future it can help us build."

Today, there are countless texts on the genocide, including memoirs, fiction, and poetry by survivors and by authors unaffiliated with the Holocaust. Almost every genre and category of authors has come under intense scrutiny, leading to questions such as: Can the violence of the Holocaust \u2013 and genocidal, racialized violence more broadly \u2013 be represented? If so, who can represent it? What is the relationship between trauma and memory? What about the relationship between literature and trauma? Does literature possess unique capabilities for producing empathy? What are the ethical questions involved in interviewing Holocaust and genocide survivors to produce literature? How does one write about collective trauma? In this course, we will examine these questions and others as we study a range of Holocaust memoirs and fiction about the Holocaust and put these primary texts in conversation with theories of Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Comparative Genocide Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, and Comparative Race and Ethnicity Studies. Throughout the semester, we will also watch and read interviews with Holocaust survivors, including some of our authors. Additionally, we will consider the relationship between race and memorialization; the under-examined role of sexual assault in the Holocaust; the under-discussed murders of the Roma, Black, disabled, and queer communities in the Holocaust; the relationship between the Holocaust, other genocides, and other forms of racialized violence; and the urgent importance of Holocaust literature in our current moment."
