The historical and geographical scope of the course will vary depending on the term, though the course will emphasize British literature. Within this literature, constructions of subjectivity and community vary greatly due to the influence of the European Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, the exploration of the New World, as well as the rediscovery of the natural world through scientific investigation. While the course will introduce the complexities of early modern literary constructions of identity, the course will also illumine the ways in which these habits of thought were increasingly contested, sometimes to the point of violence. The course will likely include period-specific as well as modern scholarship."

In each case we investigate the physical conditions of the environment, and look at some of the key current and past science questions and the techniques used to address them. We begin by studying basics of plasma physics and then apply the knowledge to the Sun, from its inner workings to its unusually hot atmosphere. This sets the stage for our subsequent survey of the solar wind and its interaction with planets that leads to the formation of magnetospheres. We also explore the techniques used to understand various space environments, from the design of detectors through the methods used to understand the collected data, to theoretical models and the computational techniques used to solve them."
