The DNP scholarly project, unlike that of PhD level research, may take a number of forms such as: practice change initiative; pilot study; program evaluation; quality improvement project; evaluation of a new practice model; or a consulting project. This course addresses the unique needs and challenges second year DNP students face while completing their projects.  Seminar content focuses on skills necessary for successful clinical project completion through: presentations, selected readings and online forums.  The seminar operates at the group level and is designed to work in concert with and support individual students' DNP Faculty Director and external mentor (often the student's preceptor at the project site).  Course content parallels the three overall stages of a DNP Scholarly Project: the design, proposal submission and proposal approval (First semester); project implementation (second semester); and, final presentation and dissemination (third semester).  Students are expected to have a Faculty Director for their project and a tentative external mentor in place prior to course entry.  This seminar is completed sequentially over a minimum of three semesters. Students are expected to be enrolled in this course each semester that they are working on the DNP Scholarly Project."

This course will not only examine the historical development, central beliefs and communal practices of the sacraments, but will also explore the \"sacramental principle\" as a way to illuminate the theological dynamics that are such an essential component of Catholic liturgy and Christian spirituality. Students will investigate the nature of the sacramental system in Catholic worship, identify the key concepts of \"sacramentality\" and explore the religious practices that are part of the living tradition of sacramental theology. Finally, students will explore how, in the end, the sacramental principle affects everything and cannot be contained. Sacramentality is a way of being, an \"eventing\" that reminds us how dynamic and transcendent (as opposed to static and insulated) life is. So, we will follow the clues where they lead and assess current relationships among sacramental theology, liturgy, artistic reflection, cross-cultural expression, and daily life."

Students will explore Roman Catholicism less as a set of definite beliefs and moral precepts, and more as a world-shaping perspective that forms Catholics to see and to be in distinctive ways.

This course examines a selection of cantos Dante's Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradiso in its cultural, theological, social and political context. In particular we will explore how the underground world imagined by the poet relates to late medieval urban life and culture. A guiding concern of the discussion is to assess the ways in which Dante changed our understanding of the relationship between the human and the divine, justice and love, will and reason, happiness and knowledge, literature and the Bible. Political turmoil, philosophical and theological paradigms social and religious conflict all converge in the making of the Comedy and will thus form crucial elements of our investigation."

        "course_description": "Conducting research is a complex, demanding, and time-consuming task. The instructor suggests that while one can be familiar with different paradigms of inquiry, one may not necessarily know how to actually undertake the task of planning and effectively proposing an investigation (Locke, et al, 1987). Others assert that what is important and might be challenging is to frame a valid problem and a specific purpose, in addition to ask the right questions which will give direction to relevant research activities (McEwan & McEwan, 2003). Given the challenge and complexity of designing proposals and conducting research activities, it is anticipated that doctoral students may benefit from additional learning experiences that may lead to the successful completion of their research projects (Ovando, 2010) including a support team to facilitate the task of planning a dissertation proposal. As others note, \"Having access to a group of peers who are also engaged in the doctoral studies journey provides an excellent source of moral support. In addition, cohort members provide empathetic listening, share resources and offer honest and constructive feedback\" (Ovando, Ramirez & Shefelbine, 2008, p. 45). In the spirit of the writing workshop (Calkins, 1986) and the professional learning community (Kanold, 2010), it is expected that all students will engage in literature searches, scholarly writing, and collaborative inquiry in a respectful and productive way in order to enhance their research capacity (conceptual, technical and interactive skills), attitudes and dispositions. Such engagement will lead to the development of a sound dissertation proposal, CITI research approval as a researcher, and to the preparation for the rigor of conducting investigations The purpose of this seminar is to guide students in the conceptualization of a proposal that ultimately will result in dissertation research project. This is not a research method or research design course, but a course focused on the actual application of research understandings, knowledge, concepts and terminology. Students must have completed the required courses: Qualitative Research (RMTD 420) Quantitative Research (RMTD 421), and possibly the third required specific research methodology course. It is assumed that these research courses provided students with considerable research information, foundational knowledge and conceptual understanding of research methods."

Therefore, it is essential that educators acquire the knowledge and skills to consider the development of literacy from a broader, less restrictive linguistic paradigm in order to engage and effectively teach reading and writing to their students who are bi/multilingual. Regardless of teaching context (e.g., grade level; bilingual or monolingual instructional setting, etc.) educators in this course are supported to move away from a monolingual paradigm in relation to literacy development in order to make strong and effective use of their students' literacy knowledge across languages. Participants will apply new learning to implement strategies (such as contrastive analysis, reading and writing opportunities in both languages, etc.) that supports the development and transference of literacy learning across languages."

Evidence that societies, which have achieved high levels of development, typically have good legal systems is incontrovertible. What is less clear is how they got where they are and in what sequence. Put differently, do good laws and institutions generate good development outcomes or does development lead to good laws and institutions?

The course begins by considering the reasons that donors provide aid generally and for rule of law, followed by the examination of the normative frameworks and standards that shape the manner in which aid is distributed, institutions and actors, mechanisms by which aid is programmed and actual use of aid by recipients. The overall approach begins at the global level and follows the chain of development aid through its various elements down to the national level. A key theme of the course is that the approach to international development assistance is broadening. Historically, financing for development was understood primarily in terms of public sector resources. As a result of a confluence of factors, development institutions have been seeking to gather resources from the private sector to supplement official development aid."

        "course_description": ".This course is designed to assist lawyers and other professionals working with the law in developing the techniques of researching and writing in relation to rule of law development. The primary objective of this course is to enable students to apply research skills, which will be instrumental for conducting in depth studies on rule of law development topics for major papers during the PROLAW Program and for the final capstone project. With a focus on development issues, substantial emphasis is given to socio-legal and empirical legal research methodologies. A secondary objective is that students will acquire writing skills that can be used in various practice settings involving legal and policy analysis, policymaking, and implementation of rule of law development research studies. Students will also gain expertise on how to research and analyze issues from other disciplines that contribute to the processes and dynamics of legal and institutional reform. This knowledge is foundational for developing theories of change and is critical to formulating strategies, plans, and analyses of rule of law advocacy and reform programs."

The final outcome of this course will enable each student to demonstrate in relation to a specific real-world law and governance reform process that he or she is capable of using what was learned in PROLAW to produce useful and professional documentation and communicate this content to clients and stakeholders effectively. In some cases, students may develop or have a preexisting relationship with an external organization, which provides an opportunity for the student to work on their particular topic. Students may alternatively decide to conduct research and determine the need and feasibility of a possible initiative to address the problem they identify. Likewise, students can also choose to develop a project to implement an existing agenda or initiative at the national or international levels. Each student will be supervised by a Capstone Project advisor."

The practical skills and knowledge acquired by examining these examples can be applied to virtually all commercial transactions.  The class will consider the art of negotiating those transactions - and will focus on the role of the lawyer in those negotiations.  We will consider a variety of negotiating strategies and how to deal effectively with opposing counsel who may, or may not, share your particular strategy.  In addition, the class will examine a corporate aircraft transaction - with a myriad of parties and opposing interests and regulations - with the goal of appreciating the juggling and balancing necessary to achieve the best result possible.  Along the way, we will look at how there is not ONE way to do things, rather there are many ways and many strategies.   The rules and processes taught in law school are there to provide guidance; they are not hard and fast rules about the way that a transaction must be done.  That's one of the benefits of being a transactional lawyer - the rules are set by the parties as they negotiate.   Students will be evaluated on the basis of classroom participation and attendance, a paper, and , in lieu of final exam, a one-on-one negotiation session with the instructor.   Regular attendance is expected; if a student cannot attend class, please notify the instructor."

        "course_description": "On its website Loyola University Chicago defines itself as \"Chicago's Jesuit, Catholic university.\"  It also makes clear that Loyola is fiercely dedicated to promoting \"social justice.\"  Likewise, in its Mission Statement, the Law School claims to be \"inspired by the Jesuit tradition\" and that it seeks \"to prepare graduates who will be ethical advocates for justice and equity.\" Did you ever wonder what this means?  What is the justice that Loyola claims to support? There are, of course, many ways of defining justice, and many critical perspectives through which law may be examined: Law & Economics, Legal Positivism, Classical Liberalism, Rawlsian Welfare State Liberalism, Legal Feminism, Legal Realism (and its successor Critical Legal Studies) and Critical Race Theory.  For each of these schools of thought there is a whole body of literature that addresses the basic questions of jurisprudence: What is law?  What is justice?  And what is the relationship between the two?  What are rights?  And where do they come from?  How are law and morality alike, and how are they different?  Is law simply the exercise of coercive power or is it something more? There is, in fact, an older school of thought from which these others are derived - a tradition that matches them in depth and rigor.  The Judeo-Christian tradition has been thinking about questions of law and justice for well over two millennia.  Moreover, since the late 19th century, with the advent of industrialization and urbanization and the new social problems brought on by these phenomena, the Catholic Church has been offering its reflections on questions of law and justice in a body of thought known as Catholic Social Teaching.  This literature is composed of papal letters (called encyclicals), documents from the Second Vatican Council, and other magisterial texts. In the course we will read samples of this literature as we think about contemporary problems and possible legal solutions: poverty, racism, capital and labor, globalization, war and peace, environmental deterioration, the family, marriage and sexuality, cultural and religious pluralism.  The course will not, however, simply be an historical review of abstract concepts and ideas within the tradition.  Law is a practical art, and legal concepts and theories have meaning in application.  They are best understood when their consequences are laid bare.  Thus, in conjunction with the various documents from Catholic Social Teaching described above, students will also read a number of cases that will help them examine the meaning of these ideas in concrete terms. The aim of this two credit course is philosophical analysis and critical reflection.  To this end, students will be required to submit a 2-4 page reflection paper every other week.  The goal is for students to emerge from the course not only with a better understanding of law and justice, but with an appreciation for what their own beliefs might mean in the practice of law.  The option of a third course credit is available for students who are willing to write an additional paper of at least 20-pages."

While the climate crisis has often been depicted as a technical problem requiring technical solutions, this course will examine the emerging body of legal scholarship, reports by UN human rights experts, and case studies on the relationship among climate change, racial injustice, and international law. It will analyze the ways that international law contributes to these intersecting injustices and how international law can be used as a tool of transformation and resistance. Caused primarily by the greenhouse gas emissions of the world's most affluent inhabitants, climate change is an injustice because its impacts are experienced most acutely by those who contributed least to the problem and have the fewest resources to protect themselves from harm. These include Indigenous peoples, the small island states, racial and ethnic minorities, poor people, and those who reside in climate-vulnerable geographic regions, including tropical, coastal, and agriculture-dependent low-income countries. While most analyses of climate injustice focus on the impacts of climate change, this course will take a deeper dive into the origins of the fossil fuel-based global economy, and the harms it inflicts on states and peoples racialized as inferior throughout its life cycle historically and currently. For example, the Industrial Revolution, which launched the age of fossil fuels, was made possible by colonialism, slavery, and the international law doctrines that justified and facilitated these practices. In the post-colonial period, international law gave primacy to the rights of foreign investors engaged in natural resource exploitation, at the expense of the states and local communities in which these projects were located. These doctrines enabled European and settler colonial states to control the world's petroleum reserves in collusion with autocratic petro-states and transnational corporations. They also produced corporate impunity for human rights and environmental violations. Today, the extraction, processing, and combustion of fossil fuels has created \"sacrifice zones\" all over the world in territories belonging to peoples and nations that were colonially designated as inferior."

The second segment, entitled \"The Ethical Practice of Business Law\" will explore the pressures on new lawyers to conform to an existing culture, how lawyers get into trouble, and how business law can be practiced in an ethical manner. The third segment, entitled \"Developing a Financial Mindset\" will introduce planning tools (e.g., the time value of money, compound interest) and the planning process in the context of both personal financial planning and business planning. Certain classes may be taught with other professors and practicing lawyers. There will be no final exam in this course. Students will be required to take a mid-term exam and to submit a short final paper. Class participation may also be taken into account. Students will also be expected to read the Wall Street Journal on a daily basis. This course is available to first-year students only."

        "course_description": "The sexual exploitation and trafficking of minors has reached a crisis point, both in the United States and abroad. The United States Congress has responded to this ever-increasing threat by passing extensive legislative enactments aimed at deterring this pernicious activity, providing severe - and often controversial - punishment for those who engage in it.  While federal and state prosecutions in this area are at an all-time  high, law enforcement and prosecutors continue to miss critical opportunities because they fail to fully understand the nature of the threat, and lack a solid grasp on the integrated arsenal of statutory tools at their disposal.  Similarly, members of the judiciary, as well as victim advocates and pretrial service officers, may appreciate the laws on the proverbial books, but often lack familiarity with the sophisticated means employed  by  organized  criminal  group  and the role of public corruption involved in the large-scale exploitation of children.  They also misunderstand the rationalization through which individuals engaged in the exploitation of children tend to self justify their conduct, and have never confronted the statistical realities challenging the belief in meaningful rehabilitation of sex offenders.  Put simply, although the complex and inter-related  legislative anti-exploitation and anti-trafficking framework is now the firmly established law of the land, its theoretical and practical nuances are widely misunderstood, and indeed are all too frequently not understood at all, by the very professionals entrusted with the difficult task of protecting humanity's most vulnerable. This seminar will start with the statutory analysis rendered more comprehensible through the vehicle of real-world examples from the experience of Judge Kendall who will explain the history and present-day reality of  the federal response to child exploitation. The seminar will analyze the various laws that govern the roles of the stakeholders: prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, immigration officials, pretrial services officers, and victim advocates. The seminar will further explore all of the victim issues that make these cases complex and challenging.  Students will explore victims' needs, rights, and opportunities for redress including restitution and expungement of criminal records.  Students will hear first hand from federal agents who have prosecuted human trafficking cases; will see and hear the evidence presented to federal juries, will hear from a victim of the crime, and will learn from those victim advocates who seek to redress the harms inflicted upon victims. The seminar will span two days and have multiple speakers and employ an interactive question and answer format.  Students will be required to submit a 15 page paper on a topic of interest from the seminar for a final grade. This is a Skills course."

This interactive and interdisciplinary seminar will explore the legal, social, and practical issues confronting children who are survivors of human trafficking, as well as an examination of efforts to prevent and intervene in this social problem.  While the seminar will focus on unique issues affecting (international and US citizen) survivors of child trafficking, students will gain knowledge and skills that are applicable to other marginalized populations of children and youth, as well as adult trafficking survivors. The seminar will begin with an overview of a history of anti-slavery statutes and case law to provide a foundation for contemporary international human rights and domestic laws addressing human trafficking. Students will be introduced to various frameworks, including criminal justice, public health, gender-based, human rights, and abolitionist, to combat human trafficking. Students will analyze current research in the field, and explore interventions utilized by both legal, social and public health providers. Assignment and exercises will include mock interviews, critical analysis of legislation, and a final project addressing ways to advance the movement to combat child trafficking in the United States.

The premise of the proposed course is that Black traditions have long offered visions of global order that challenge the color blindness embedded in accounts of international law. Black traditions counter visions of international law that order the world in accordance with predominantly European and white conceptions of hierarchy and order. They challenge distortions black and non-white peoples as inferior and therefore fair game for subjugation and dehumanization through practices such as slavery and colonialism and the continuing legacies of these practices to date.

The course will focus on a range of formal and informal documents and communication formats: drafting contract provisions and letters to clients and counterparties in transactional and pre-contentious settings; reviewing, interpreting, and editing the (often imperfect) contracts submitted by opposing counsel; preparing transaction task lists, due diligence memoranda or other internal communications for use by colleagues; and presentations to a board of directors or other client audience supported by written materials including PowerPoint visuals with substantive content and impact. Some attention will be given to ethics and professionalism in written content, including in the context of engagement letters with clients, declination letters with prospective clients, and conflict waivers among clients. Several sessions will also focus on special considerations when working and communicating with clients and counterparties in or from other countries where the laws, customs, practices, and language are different from our own. In-class sessions will typically be used for lecture and discussion to develop concepts and facts from selected readings and materials, which students will then incorporate in brief written assignments before the next class.

The course focuses on the development of skills necessary for particular writing assignments that arise in the course of civil and criminal litigation.  Students learn how to perform these skills through in-class discussion of the assignments and through the writing necessary to complete the assignments.  Because practice in oral advocacy highlights ways in which a lawyer's writing can be improved, this course will call on you to participate in oral advocacy exercises as well as undertake the specific writing assignments.   The course covers a wide range of skills, including the drafting of legal memoranda and pleadings, the preparation and presentation of motions, opening statements and closing arguments, the development of outlines to examine or interview witnesses, the use of discovery tools, and the application of a structured approach to settlement negotiations."

As necessary, students will be required to review relevant geopolitical history that both influenced and resulted from this evolution. A note of caution: this course will encounter detestable concepts, such as the persistent idea that some humans were \"natural slaves,\" \"infidels,\" \"savages,\" or \"barbarians\" unworthy of equal legal or moral status or treatment. These concepts played a significant role in legal and moral justifications for colonization and other subjugation, including dispossessing indigenous peoples of their native lands. During the course, students will be required to independently research (at least 1 book or 3 significant scholarly articles) and consider the influences of this history on a contemporary issue in the U.S. or international legal system.  The final grade will be determined by a student's effort in completing short reflection papers for each reading assignment, and the quality of a final seminar reflection paper that considers the course as a whole in relation to the student's independent research."

What is the interpretative function of courts? Should integrity constrain what courts decide? From whence does the duty to obey law come? Are there any human rights? Might some of these rights by manifested by our ideas of liberty, privacy and freedom of expression?  Need we respond to terrorism by changing our values? What is distributive justice as compared with corrective or retributive justice? Are distributive justice questions implicated by court decisions involving affirmative action, gender, and sexual orientation? How is corrective justice manifested in tort and contract law?  What is ownership? Is ownership of intellectual property morally justified?  What is the relationship of causation to responsibility, and what is punishment and how is it justified.  Students may take this three hour course either as a lecture course with a midterm and final exam or a seminar with a 20 page research paper due at the end."

Suppose that a court has concluded that it has subject matter and personal jurisdiction, so it can \"speak law\" or \"speak rights\" to the parties before it (as the term \"jurisdiction\" suggests) but faces two or more sovereigns whose law arguably might apply. At its most basic, this course addresses the next question: which sovereign's law should the court speak? The course explores this and related questions in many contexts and the various methods that courts and scholars have proposed and adopted to answer them. We consider contrasting points of view regarding choice of law, jurisdiction, and recognition of foreign judgments, asking which policies best promote fairness and harmony both nationally and internationally and meet the federal constitutional requirements of due process of law and full faith and credit for the judgments of other states. A remarkable aspect of this course is the way it cuts across time and many practice areas, probably first introducing you to some of those areas and inviting you to wrestle both with historical legal questions and cutting-edge, or even future, issues."

We will also explore how the law has changed in response to what we've learned about wrongful convictions.  Among other factors, the course will specifically consider interrogations and false confessions, forensics and their (mis)use in the criminal law, and eyewitness testimony and memory and factors that may make it fallible.  The course will draw from case law, national academy of science reports and related research, and multidisciplinary research in the areas of psychology, social sciences, and the law.  The course will also focus on solutions: how have system actors responded? What changes in law have emerged? What changes in practice, including practices in prosecution or police departments.  We address the systemic causes of wrongful convictions and consider the impact of such convictions on men and women of color, particularly on Black men and teenagers, who have been disproportionately impacted.     In addition to the seminar component, the course will provide students experience addressing and advising the Minnesota Conviction Review Unit (CRU.)  The Minnesota CRU is one of a handful of state-wide conviction review units in the country.     In the wake of the murder of George Floyd, community members, legislatures, and policy makers sought ways to address the harms created by the criminal legal system. The CRU formed in 2020, when its partnership with the Great North Innocence Project led to grant funding from the U.S. Department of Justice. That same year, Attorney General Keith Ellison created an advisory board composed of diverse legal and community experts with direct experience in the Minnesota criminal legal system. Students in the course will work directly with the Minnesota CRU to assist the CRU in designing protocol and a prioritization of the hundreds of cases it has been asked to review.  Students will not be involved in direct representation of any individuals, nor in the investigation of any individual claims.  Rather, students will assist in reviewing and identifying the claims presented for review, and devising a system for their review.  Students will work on the issues in small groups during every class.       Assessments will be conducted in the following manner: Students will ask to write two short (3 pages) response papers during the semester; students' participation will also be considered; finally, the preparation and development of the experiential work will also be considered and weigh heavily in the grading."

To most effectively explore these issues, the course is divided into three components: bi-weekly seminars, several experiential activities and a research project. Each is described briefly below.  (1)The bi-weekly seminars will provide necessary framework and context for the experiential learning activities and the research projects. Our seminar will begin with an overview of the challenges of ensuring access to civil justice, with each subsequent seminar analyzing more specific and complex access-oriented issues related to everything from the various actors in the civil justice system to innovations in the delivery of legal services.   (2)Each student will complete a research project with course faculty providing supervision. Completed research projects will assist the Illinois Supreme Court Commission on Access to Justice and other legal and judicial system stakeholders. To be successful in these projects, students will be expected to complete legal research, in-depth legal reasoning and policy analysis. Depending on class size, these projects may be assigned to students to work in pairs. In addition to the written work-product, students will present and answer questions about their research to a panel of access to justice experts at the last class of the semester. (3)Finally, at various intervals throughout the semester, and as identified in the syllabus below, students will be asked to complete a series of experiential activities that will be incorporated into class discussions.  These experiential activities will increase students' understanding of access to justice issues.  Students will be required to spend 120 hours completing the experiential activities and research project assigned during the semester. This is an Experiential Learning and Skills course."

Constitutional Law, Torts, Contracts, and Federal Civil Procedure, in particular, bear directly on the subject matter of the course. Remedies is therefore sometimes called a \"capstone course,\" because it provides students an opportunity to bring together what they have learned in other courses on substantive and procedural law. One important component of the course is review problem sets (problems similar to examination questions and often presaging them) that are discussed in class. Another is an emphasis on how the remedial issues that become the subject of appellate opinions arise in the first instance, and are presented and play out at the trial court level.

Fast paced advancement in information technology and the resulting tsunami of digital evidence have proven to be profoundly challenging to the judicial system. The enormous volumes of data generated by litigants and the resultant costs of eDiscovery drive litigation and settlement strategy. The law, the courts and legal practitioners have all had to adjust. Both knowledge of eDiscovery and practical application of eDiscovery are differentiators for many clients choosing counsel and for law firms hiring litigation attorneys. This course will provide you with practical skills that will help you advocate for your clients and be cognizant of the challenges that eDiscovery can create from a litigation and cost perspective. These are must-have skills for litigators regardless of the area of practice. Law 367 will focus on early stage eDiscovery practice. Development of an eDiscovery strategy and negotiation of discovery protocols are two particularly challenging and vitally important aspects of litigation practice.

Students may propose the provision of project-based legal assistance to a public, non-governmental or professional organization or another proposal that allows students an opportunity to exercise planning, project-management, problem-solving and other skills in a real-world setting, while at the same time developing the capacity for self-directed learning. Project requirements: Students must submit a written proposal for review and approval to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs in the semester prior to enrollment in the course setting forth the following: - A description of the project, including its purpose and potential impact on the   organization on whose behalf the project is being undertaken; - \tAn implementation work plan, including time line and progress benchmarks; -      The number of students participating in the project; - \tA plan for faculty supervision (student must seek out and secure the participation of a faculty adviser); - \tMemorandum of understanding from the relevant organization (if applicable); - \tThe specific knowledge, skills and values that would be needed to bring the project to successful completion; - \tProposed deliverables, which should include a mechanism for student reflection on the capstone experience; - \tProposed criteria for evaluating student performance.  Examples of approved Capstone projects: SUFEO (Stand Up For Each Other) suspension advocacy project, Dialogue De Novo a Loyola Law community and legal interview podcast, and Legislative Advocacy Supporting the LGBTQ+ Community project."

Further, we will explore how to develop social interventions that disrupt these normative patterns of racialized state violence and facilitate the elimination of racially based, gender biased structures and practices in order to facilitate critical pedagogy, moral leadership, legal practice, and social movement organizing."

Three parallel case studies will run through the course, illustrating the application of each topic to different types of client organizations: a Fortune 500 industrial company, an entrepreneurial family-owned business, and a medium-sized not-for-profit organization. The class will be presented with a series of problem simulations built around diverse, realistic business situations for these mock clients. Topics may include structuring; due diligence; letters of intent and similar preliminary documentation; suggesting changes to sample transactional documents that protect and advance clients' objectives; and deal implementation. The course will use traditional learning techniques as well as simulations throughout the semester to explore the role of the transactional lawyer in both a familiar, domestic U.S. context and an increasingly global marketplace. More than ever, business lawyers are afforded the opportunity - and the challenge - of coordinating and planning projects abroad in markets unfamiliar to them, as well as advising international clients with in-bound investments in the lawyer's home market. There are frequent occasions to interact with people whose experience, way of doing business, and goals are different from our own. They may be clients, partners, or counterparties. The professional opportunity in law practice is to become progressively adept at discarding jargon and misconceptions and bridging expectations among transactional participants and their advisors. The course will use primarily real estate project fact situations, since most students can easily imagine and relate to client objectives involved in buying, selling, leasing, or otherwise occupying real property, and since in the international aspects of the course the approaches to property rights and occupancy are so fascinatingly different country to country. But the course's learning points will also have general application in other types of commercial transactions. The course's emphasis on case studies and commercial transaction scenarios is also designed to act as a capstone course which complements and draws upon the students' prior coursework in contracts, real estate and commercial transactions, ethics, and government regulation. Students will be graded based on written assignments and exercises and class participation. There is no final examination for this course. (Hagy)"

Unlike a trial, arbitration or appellate setting, where the people listening to you are neutral, in a mediation you are dealing with the decision makers on the other side, people who often behave in a hostile manner towards you and your client.  Through practice you can acquire skills that will make you an effective advocate in a mediation setting, including learning to communicate information to the other side in a way they can hear it, identifying the various needs and interests of the parties (as opposed to just the positions), and approaching a dispute as an opportunity to solve a problem creatively. We will touch on the decision science (neuroscience, psychology, and behavioral economics) and cultural competency tools that can make you more effective, and also explore Online Dispute Resolution (ODR), which is quickly emerging as a way to resolve disputes using AI in combination with human mediators. The problem solving skills you will learn in this class can be tremendously helpful whether you are representing a client in a mediation, negotiating a deal in a business or government setting, or settling a case in a pre-trial conference with a judge.  Clients appreciate lawyers with these skills because they are able to preserve business and family relationships while still obtaining results that protect client interests at a reasonable cost. Conflict management skills are also highly valued in non-traditional legal careers.  The course will also prepare you to represent a client in positional negotiations where the mediator provides an evaluation of the case. Mediation skills are best learned from hands-on experience.  Therefore, a substantial portion of this class will involve role-playing simulations.  Over the course of this class, you will have the opportunity to serve as mediators, represent clients, be clients, and give feedback as observers."

The course will use a real world immigration policy as the foundation for this learning.  Students will learn about a contemporary immigration policy and develop arguments to challenge or defend it.  The principle assignments will be to draft a motion for summary judgment as well as a legal memorandum that addresses the issues that would likely be raised by opposition and potential responses to those arguments.

The individual development of a professional identity is critical to meeting these goals. This required 1 credit, 5 week first year course seeks to assist students in the recognition and elimination of personal bias and building awareness of how diversity and inclusion of others whose world view is different from one's own is critical to professional development and success in the practice of law. The course objectives include the education and development of professionals prepared to enter the workplace with the tools needed to successfully engage and manage diverse environments with the ability to think critically about various legal issues, problems and solutions and how they impact different groups of people and communities differently based on identity, privilege and oppression.

        "course_description": "Since the onset of the global financial crisis, the role of the lawyer has expanded. Law firms and their clients alike expect new lawyers to not only understand the law but the basics of accounting and finance as well. This intensive pass/no pass course in accounting and finance is designed to help prepare law students for the demands of a career within a law firm. Topics covered include: How to read and analyze financial statements How to calculate returns on investments How to value companies How to structure securities Goal: To prepare law students for careers in a changing economy in which lawyers will be expected, and even obligated, to understand the intricacies of the business world. Description: This Unique program was designed to bring the world of finance and accounting to aspiring lawyers. It seeks to offer law students an overview of business concepts most relevant to legal professionals and relates these concepts to a broad array of practice areas. The course progresses in order of difficulty beginning with basic elements of accounting and concluding with more advance concepts related to securities pricing.   Agenda Financial Statements: Analyzing financial statements has been a tsk traditionally performed by investment bankers and accountants. However, with accounting scandals threatening to erode confidence in corporate America, attorneys are taking on a prominent role in preparing and analyzing financial statements. Including the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement, this course is designed to give students an overview of accounting techniques and their relevance. Financial Analysis: The process of analyzing financial statements is involved in virtually every business decision. As corporate managers and bankers rely more on the advice of their inside and outside counsel, it is now imperative that an attorney better understand basic business decision making tools. This course will allow students to understand different methods of analyzing financial statements, what they are used for, and who uses them. Issues in Financial Reporting: In the wake of the massive corporate accounting scandals such as Enron, WorldCom, and Parmalat, the importance of detecting such fraud has taken on new proportions. No longer a matter reserved exclusively for accounts and financial analysts, accounting fraud is a concern of most attorneys who must be able to detect and report any suspicious of questionable reporting practices. This course is designed to equip students with the basic skills to determine signs of corporate accounting fraud along with guidance on what to do when confronted with such matters. Corporate Finance: With Issues related to corporate finance becoming more relevant today than ever, the role a lawyer plays in structuring transactions, negotiating deal terms, and coordinating the underwriting process is becoming increasingly important. This course provides the basic tools to understand, apply and challenge most aspects of financial management. Valuation: Valuation forms the cornerstone of nearly every business transaction. Whether it involves mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, venture capital, or real estate, a solid understanding of valuation will ensure an equitable transaction. Attorneys play an active role in these transactions but all too often become entrenched in the purely legal aspects of them. This course will help students to better understand the methodology and techniques behind various forms of valuation and in turn, better serve the needs of their clients. Securities: Attorneys play a vital role in capital formation and deal structuring for companies of all sizes. This course is designed to offer students a better understanding of the financial instruments they help structure. Topics covered will include stocks bonds, and derivatives. Additionally, the course will explore these concepts in the context of real cases drawn from recent transactions. Students will be responsible for class participation and a review project."

Mediation techniques and skills are extremely beneficial to attorneys.

Business Planning: Transactions A business lawyer needs to know, or at least be generally familiar with, many areas of law.   Therefore, the purpose of this course is to teach many legal issues, including: (1)    the organization of a business (e.g., the types of legal entities including \"C\" corporation, \"S\" corporation, partnership, and limited liability company), organizational documents for a corporation and a limited liability company, control issues including the problems of a minority shareholder in a privately owned business, and understanding balance sheets and income statements; (ii)    the financing of that business (including compliance with the federal securities laws in connection with private offerings and public offerings, bank borrowing and granting collateral pursuant to Article 9 of the UCC); (iii)    certain key day-to-day transactions (including intellectual property, environmental law, labor law, real estate law, and sales of personal property as regulated by Article 2 of the UCC); (iv)    buying and selling a business (including certain tax and non tax issues, documentation, hostile tender offers, going private and leveraged buyouts); and (v)    the financially trouble business (including workouts and the rudiments of securitization). There is a large handout, but the substance of the course is contained primarily in the lectures.   Therefore, regular attendance is expected.   There is no prerequisite for this course but some prior exposure to business law (e.g., Business Organizations) is desirable."

        "course_description": "This course counts as a Comprehensive Simulation and Skills Course There are more than 1.5 million not-for-profit organizations in the United States alone, and more throughout the world. Not-for-profit organizations contribute to society in many ways, through diverse missions from education and research, to social services, relief, and advocacy, to religion, to arts and culture. In addition to the impact made through their missions, not-for-profits as a group are significant as employers and for their contribution to the general economy as well. Not-for-profit organizations exist to further their charitable purposes, do not distribute dividends or net revenues (having no private shareholders or owners), and often are formed and operated to qualify for Federal income tax exemption under Section 501(c)(3) or other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Nonetheless, they have many of the same operational needs and characteristics of any other business. They occupy space (whether owned, leased, or hosted by others). They purchase and consume goods and services from vendors and suppliers. They manage and cope with attendant risks. Interestingly, commentators suggest that not-for-profits can be more complex to manage, and to advise, than a for-profit business. The organization may have funding constraints, staff constraints, and knowledge constraints, particularly when coping with transactions or situations that arise only occasionally or where the organization is governed or operated in whole or in part by volunteers. Not-for-profit facilities and operations can be uniquely complex (think for example about a museum, a zoo, a hospital, or a cathedral), and their diverse sources of governmental and private funding can come with extensive conditions, restrictions, and reporting requirements. They may even be offered (or accept) donated goods or services in kind, gifts that come with their own implications. This course will explore the opportunities and challenges for lawyers involved with not-for-profit organizations, whether as paid or pro bono legal advisors, or as board members or volunteers. The course will use a combination of traditional lecture and discussion, case study simulations, and guest speakers, as well as individual meetings with students on directed work. The course will be centered around a recurrent series of fictional clients, each a not-for-profit organization, engaged in a variety of operational and transactional situations. Each client organization will have a different mission, size, and resources, as well as mock client representatives who will have different business and style preferences, which the class will need to accommodate and will come to anticipate in fashioning and recommending solutions for each client. Each student will be invited to select and imagine a mock client organization with a not-for-profit mission suited to the student's interest and will have the opportunity to identify and explore individual topics relevant to not-for-profit transactions, operations, and governance. The course will also consider issues of legal ethics and professional conduct, as well as governance and fiduciary duty of board members, in the not-for-profit context. The course's emphasis on case studies and commercial transaction scenarios is also designed to act as a capstone course which complements and draws upon the students' prior coursework in contracts, real estate and commercial transactions, ethics, and government regulation. In these ways, the course emphasizes skills relevant in any transactional project, for-profit or otherwise. Students will be graded based on class participation, written assignments and exercises, and a paper and presentation resulting from research and study on their chosen mock client and individual study topics. There is no final examination for this course. (Hagy)"

One of the most important features of our constitutional system is the general division of governmental authority between state and national governments, and nowhere is that division of authority more important to practicing lawyers than in the allocation of judicial power between the state and federal courts. The former are, of course, courts of general jurisdiction, while the latter are courts of limited jurisdiction. The overall design of the course seeks to assist students in thinking about this allocation of power, not as a merely theoretical matter, but as one of real practical consequence in connection with a client's substantive goals and how best to serve them. Litigants typically want access to the federal courts for very specific (and often very important) reasons: to obtain remedies for violations of federal constitutional and statutory law, or, in some cases, to secure a forum that they believe will be more hospitable to their claims.  Seen in this way, the law of the federal courts consists of doctrines that either facilitate or frustrate litigants in achieving their substantive goals in the federal (and state) courts. The aim of the course is to provide students with a basic framework for thinking effectively about these problems.   This course may be offered only every other year."

        "course_description": "Prisoner Rights Litigation is enormous. It accounts for up to twenty percent of cases filed in federal courts; indeed, over 300 of the roughly 1,500 civil cases filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in 2022 were brought by prisoners alleging unconstitutional conditions of confinement (lack of healthcare or dental care, cell infestations, inhumane temperatures, discipline without due process, suppression of religion or speech, or inadequate diet-to name some). And in this area, access to counsel is a critically unmet legal need, forcing many prisoners to litigate potentially meritorious claims without counsel. Yet this absence of counsel is perplexing given that this practice area can be lucrative for attorneys due to the guarantee of attorneys' fees under the Civil Rights Attorneys Fees Act.  To resolve that discrepancy, this course is intended to prepare students for practice in prisoner's rights cases. This course will benefit students whether they practice in this area full time or on a pro-bono basis.  The topics this course will cover include the federal rights that individuals retain while detained pending trial and after conviction, as well as areas of practice unique to litigating prisoners' constitutional claims. Students will also have an opportunity during the semester to hear from a guest speaker (TBA) who was formerly incarcerated and will discuss common issues of living in prison, including physical conditions, medical and mental health care, access to the grievance process and the courts in general. Course formative and evaluative assessments will provide students opportunities to learn the material, demonstrate understanding, and hone writing skills for practice. The primary method to assess student learning in this course will be the preparation of both a trial brief and an appellate brief. Students will also undergo four unannounced quizzes that will measure how well they understand the material. In addition to these assignments, class participation is critical and will be part of the final course grade."

It covers such themes as the allocation and interplay of power between the Congress and the President on matters of war making, emergency powers, intelligence gathering, targeted killing, indefinite detention, Military Commissions, and the looming prospect of a statutory schema for addressing the rising threat of domestic terrorism. Conventional wisdom overweighs 9/11 and its aftermath as the anchor point for examination of this field of law.  In fact, and as the course explores, its roots must be traced from 19th century conflicts with native peoples to slavery and the Civil War, and then coursing through industrial and social strife in the early 20th century, Cold War anti-Communism and the 1947 National Security Act, to the ongoing War on Terror - foreign in the wake of 9/11 to which paralleling concerns of domestic forms now proliferate, with each draw on organizing tenets involving the othering of minorities. To the extent that \"national security law,\" can be said to cogently exist as a discreet field, it operates from the underpinnings of a complex mix of legal and political theory under the penumbra of Emergency Powers or, more classically, The State of Exception made famous by Weimar jurist and political theorist Carl Schmitt, with antecedents in the work of John Locke and Thomas Hobbes. The mix is inextricably intertwined with U.S. foreign policy concerns and their historical fluctuations. These theoretical considerations therefore frame and inform the course's interrogation of the legal structures and doctrines.  It also engages with the topic of how ideas of membership and belonging have shaped our judgments as a world power nation-state about who and what counts as an external threat."

        "course_name": "Electronic Discovery and Problem Solving",
        "course_description": "Electronic discovery (\"e-discovery\") is the practice of working with digital evidence during legal proceedings. It is at the intersection of law and such information technology disciplines as computer forensics, information governance, data analytics, machine and rule based learning, and artificial intelligence (and so that we do not scare anyone away, we expect that most students will have little experience with these concepts). Proficiency in e-discovery has become a must-have skill set for litigators. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Evidence have already been modified multiple times in the last few years to try to address e-discovery concerns, and additional changes are under review by the drafters. The states have followed suit with their own rules. A burgeoning body of case law comes down each year, attempting to define the legal and ethical obligations of parties and counsel when preserving, collecting, reviewing, and producing electronically stored information. The result is a fundamental change in litigation practice. For example: the enormous costs of e-discovery drive settlement strategy in commercial litigation; divorce and trade-secret cases hinge on the contents of a party's cloud email account; product liability and personal injury cases focus on output from the Internet of Things; prosecutors and criminal defense attorneys fight to balance the wealth of evidence available from mobile phones with privacy rights; legal privilege protections are diminished because it is difficult to find attorney/client communications among large volumes of email; technology-savvy attorneys use their expertise to contest the authenticity and probative value of key pieces of evidence based on arcane metadata; parties seek arbitration or trial venues based on the protections and burden of local discovery rules; international reaction to US cyber-snooping hindered the ability of US litigants to obtain information from foreign parties; and, attorneys and litigants are sanctioned with alarming frequency for failure to properly manage e-discovery. Mastery of e-discovery is a differentiator for clients choosing counsel and for law firms in the hiring of new attorneys. Law 551 is a survey course, to familiarize students with foundational concepts, and to delve into some of the more challenging questions that e-discovery poses. It will also look at creative and strategic ways that lawyers use digital evidence to advance their cases. The course will include a combination of lecture, discussion, and practical application, allowing students an opportunity to explore issues and practice their advocacy and problem solving skills. Readings will consist of case law, statutory and regulatory guidelines, ethical guidelines, research, and white papers. Grading will be based on class participation, a mid-term exam and a theme paper."

        "course_description": "The purpose of this course is to provide students with a survey of current and emerging issues in American civil rights litigation. It defines civil rights broadly and incorporates issues related to food justice as well as traditional doctrines addressing discrimination based on race, gender and other identities. As a start, the materials on racial discrimination serve as an anchor. The foundational framework for our civil rights laws is directly related to our racially discriminatory laws. For that reason, the course starts with landmark cases and historical developments impacting the social and legal treatment of blacks and other communities of color. Additionally, it asks students to think about what law is, what law is doing, and what it should be.  The coverage, then, expands to the diverse areas of civil rights laws. Throughout, students will learn the contours of each doctrine, the principles that form it and their practical relevance. This begins with a discussion of racial discrimination as the catalyst for civil rights jurisprudence in America. The Civil Rights Act and relevant doctrines of the 14th Amendment are important to understanding the development of civil rights litigation. Ongoing and emerging issues affecting gay, transgender, women, nonconforming individuals, and poor classes are also covered as vibrant parts of civil rights jurisprudence.  To this end, the course's materials are divided into three parts: the first part deals with foundational and historical issues that impact today's jurisprudence. Chapters in this first section examine the road to Brown and the struggle for desegregation in school systems nationally. It also discusses pre and post Reconstruction cases and statutes still relevant today.  The second part examines in detail the cases and laws that make up the modern civil rights landscape. As such, it starts with the Civil Rights Act and a close examination of Title VII, Tile IX and Title VI. This section also includes cases that make up the voting rights canon as well as chapters on disability law, language minorities, and gender discrimination.   The third section delves into a study of emerging issues in the twenty-first century. In these materials, relevant issues include the struggle for sustainability as civil rights issues, food justice, gender identity, sexual orientation, and same sex marriage."

        "course_description": "Animals (meaning comprehensively for this purpose non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and insects) are central to our world in a myriad of ways. Historically, and still today (not without controversy and for better or worse depending both on degree and on your perspective), animals were and are a major source of food, as well as a tool of production as farm labor, transportation, policing and security, military activities, and entertainment and education, an object of scientific and medical research, and work as service and support animals. Animals are also key components - and participants - in our ecology and environment; after all, they have been on the planet in one form or another 500 million years before the first humans are believed to have emerged (and, even then, Darwin might point out that we have them to thank). Moreover, companion animals have been sources of friendship, companionship, and love throughout centuries and especially in modern society where they are often viewed as family members and not as possessions. These attachments, and public concern for the welfare of animals, also result in a determination to protect animals (although arguably in some contexts but not others) from neglect and abuse.  For all of these reasons, animals intersect with virtually every aspect of legal concept and practice: property law, contracts, tort, criminal law, environmental law, wills and trusts, constitutional law, international law and trade, and more. And, like every area of law, animal law continues to evolve through legislative and regulatory action, judicial decision, and societal sentiment. That change can be complex, involving considerations of both human and non-human safety and wellbeing, ethical and moral beliefs, and economic interests. In this course, together we will explore themes across the spectrum of how the law touches and treats animals in our society, in our economy, in our homes, and in the wild. We will use a textbook as a starting resource, supplemented by materials from primary and real-world sources and contexts, as points of discussion and discernment. Each class member will also select an individual topic in an area of personal interest to develop in further depth and to share with the class to expand our knowledge. Coursework on which the performance assessment is based will be composed of a series of objective or short-answer written assignments throughout the course, a concise paper and class presentation on the student's chosen individual in-depth topic, a brief take home final examination that also serves as a summative reflection on the course, and class participation."

Yet, it is all but forgotten that the federal courts developed in precisely this manner at the hands of many successive (and sometimes shortsighted) Congresses.  Since 1789, Congress has tinkered with every conceivable detail pertaining to the Third Branch, from the important (such as defining federal jurisdiction) to the trivial (such as micromanaging times for holding court).  Some of these efforts were short-lived, while others have persisted since the first Judiciary Act of 1789 and today constitute cornerstones of the modern federal judiciary.  With that pedigree in mind, this course will examine certain aspects of the evolution of the federal courts from 1789 to the present, with particular emphasis on the structure and function of current, abolished and reconstituted Article III (i.e., constitutional) courts, federal judicial legislation, the federal judiciary, specialized Article III courts, the advent of Article I (i.e., legislative) courts and court officials.

Overarching issues that will animate our exploration will be the need for emergency rules and powers, the role(s) of the courts and counsel, and how well the U.S. legal system faces the challenge of balancing rule of law and civil liberty principles with the national security concerns in countering terrorism, both internationally and domestically.

The course also has a classroom component that meets each Wednesday from noon to 2 p.m. The purpose of the classroom component is to provide students with a theoretical overview of the lawyering skills that they perform at the clinic. In addition to regular clinic hours and classroom work, clinic students work on their cases during an additional 6 hours a week, most of this work done on the student's own time. Any student who has completed the first year of law school can enroll in the clinic course. Students in the LUCLC represent children in contested guardianship cases and clients in civil cases involving landlord/tenant, family and elder law problems.

A medical malpractice trial often becomes a \"battle of the experts\". If the trial is the battle, then pre-trial motion practice defines the battlefield. Students will research both the Frye standard that applies to challenges in Illinois, and the subsequent Daubert standard that applies to challenges in federal court and most state courts.  Students will be provided with a closed \"record\" that includes a complaint, answer, selected written discovery, excerpts from depositions of treating physicians, and a full deposition of the expert to be challenged.  The exact facts and opinions will need to be developed over the spring and summer but could include a dispute based on the preferred approach for a surgical procedure, the process for extracting and freezing eggs for fertility treatment, best practices for preventing falls in a nursing faculty, the use of homeopathic medicine, or off-label use of prescription medicine. The course will be mindful that most (if not all) second-year students have not taken Evidence but will include some discussion of motions to exclude expert opinions in the context of pre-trial motions in limine and pre-trial preparation. The course will culminate in a final motion to exclude using the Daubert standard and a mock hearing of that motion. Learning objectives include understanding how trial judges use Frye or Daubert to review proposed expert opinions to determine if sufficiently reliable, analyzing expert opinions and testimony, preparing oral arguments against opposing expert testimony, writing persuasively about medical opinions using case law, medical literature, evidentiary standards and policy, and gaining practical experience about the type of writing that trial lawyers do before trial.

Sponsored by Pace Law School, the Vis Moot is based on a problem governed by the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). In the spring, an oral competition is held in two different venues, Vienna and Hong Kong. Recently, Loyola has been able to send a different team of students to each of the venues. The course includes about three weeks of study of the CISG, as well as approximately three weeks of study of international commercial arbitration, including basic laws and rules, how to draft an arbitration clause, how to choose an arbitrator, and how to participate in an arbitration as an advocate and as an arbitrator. While the first half of the semester is spent learning about the CISG and arbitration, the second half is spent putting that knowledge into practice. When the problem on which the Moot Competition is based comes on line in October, students work collaboratively to draft Claimants' and Respondents' memoranda. The Claimant's memorandum is due in early December, and the Respondent's memorandum is due in late January. Students also present tow  oral arguments: one at the law school before a panel of moot alumni, and one before arbitrators from Chicago law firms, at the offices of the respective law firms. At the end of the semester, eight students are chosen who will have the opportunity to compete in Vienna and Hong Kong during the spring semester, for an additional two hours of credit. Through the emphasis on both brief writing and oral arguments, students make significant progress in their skills as advocates, as well as their understanding of dispute resolution in an international context. Their accomplishments have been well recognized in both competitions. More information about the Vis Moot is on the Pace Law School Website: www.cisg.law.pace.edu/vis.html. Eligibility: If a student is part of a moot court team that will be arguing in the fall semester, he or she is not eligible to take this course, since this is a skills-based course requiring substantial out of class effort in both brief writing and oral argument. If a student is part of a moot court team that will be arguing in the spring semester, he or she is eligible to take the course in the fall, but will not be eligible to compete to be an oralist in the Vienna or Hong Kong competition. Corboy Fellows are not permitted to take this course.  Important: Permission of the professor is required.

        "course_description": "The course uses as a focus the Willem C. Vis International Moot Arbitration Competition. Sponsored by Pace Law School, the Vis Moot is based on a problem governed by the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). In the spring, an oral competition is held in two different venues, Vienna and Hong Kong. Recently, Loyola has been able to send a different team of students to each of the venues. The course includes about three weeks of study of the CISG, as well as approximately three weeks of study of international commercial arbitration, including basic laws and rules, how to draft an arbitration clause, how to choose an arbitrator, and how to participate in an arbitration as an advocate and as an arbitrator.   While the first half of the semester is spent learning about the CISG and arbitration, the second half is spent putting that knowledge into practice. When the problem on which the Moot Competition is based comes on line in October, students work collaboratively to draft Claimants' and Respondents' memoranda. The Claimant's memorandum is due in early December, and the Respondent's memorandum is due in late January. Students also present an oral argument before arbitrators from Chicago law firms, at the offices of the respective law firms. At the end of the semester, a second oral argument is held at the law school, after which students are chosen who will have the opportunity to compete in Vienna and Hong Kong during the spring semester, for an additional two hours of credit.   Through the emphasis on both brief writing and oral arguments, students make significant progress in their skills as advocates, as well as their understanding of dispute resolution in an international context. Their accomplishments have been well recognized in both competitions. More information about the Vis Moot is on the Pace Law School Website: www.cisg.law.pace.edu/vis.html. Eligibility: If a student is part of a moot court team that will be arguing in the fall semester, he or she is not eligible to take this course, since this is a skills-based course requiring substantial out of class effort in both brief writing and oral argument. If a student is part of a moot court team that will be arguing in the spring semester, he or she is eligible to take the course in the fall, but will not be eligible to compete to be an oralist in the Vienna or Hong Kong competition. Corboy Fellows are not permitted to take this course.  Important: Permission of the professor is required. In order to apply, please submit a resume and a statement of interest to Professor Moses, mmoses1@luc.edu explaining a little about your background, and why you are interested in taking this course"

We will start by distinguishing mergers from other types of business conduct which implicate antitrust and competition laws and address the question of why mergers are treated differently.  The course will then address basic principles used in the substantive review of mergers.  We will start by identifying the economic rationale supporting the prohibition of mergers and the basic economic theories used to distinguish permissible mergers from impermissible mergers.  We will then ask whether these theories apply across jurisdictions.   We also will devote several sessions to the procedural context of merger review.  We will discuss the basic question of why mergers need to be scrutinized in advance and the efficiencies of this approach.  We will also address the complexities of securing merger review clearance for a multinational transaction in a world of differing, overlapping and sometimes conflicting merger laws.  That discussion will inevitably lead us to the issue of extraterritoriality: To what extent may a jurisdiction apply its merger laws to a transaction occurring outside of that jurisdiction? The course will conclude with a discussion of the internationalization of merger review.  This will include various proposals at convergence, harmonization and the creation of a supra-national merger review authority.  It will also involve a discussion of the various institutions which are trying to address the issues created by a world of differing, overlapping and sometimes conflicting merger laws such as the International Competition Network, UNCTAD and the WTO."

The course will provide students with an overview of topics that concern regulatory theory, administrative law, legislation, and individual rights' concerns. As public health authorities are confronted with ever complex challenges, the role of law is pivotal in both directing regulatory responses, as well in shaping strategies to combat perceived abuses of government power. Few areas of law and policy are as dynamic as public health law as the field plays a central role in major, ongoing areas of population health such as Covid-19, opioid abuse, climate change, disaster preparedness and response, etc. The course will focus on four themes: (1) the structure and powers of public health agencies in confronting traditional and evolving health threats, (2) the challenge of balancing individual rights against population health concerns, (3) the role of civil litigation in influencing changes in public health with a focus on legal settlements in the areas of tobacco and opioids, (4) international and comparative law approaches to meeting cross border health challenges. The course is taught online and combines several live class sessions with programmed modules. Students will be required to make several in-class presentations that will be the basis of three required essay assignments."
