There will be an emphasis on morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations of terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Other topics may include orogeny, geomorphology, human dimensions, biogeography, diversification, adaptive pressures, speciation, climatology, and climate change. Topics presented will apply to mountain systems universally; however, much of the emphasis is placed on issues within the Western United States. Additional projects and assignments required for graduate credit. Typically Offered: Fall and Summer."

Like PGA 105 this course will have four main areas of focus that build on previous topics. First, the focus will be on feedback and transfer practice. Explanations on how feedback functions in learning golf skills and discusses the key factors that influence effectiveness, in a combination of how variables within practice help facilitate golf skill learning (Learning B). Second, a focus on how to make sure you control the pace and delivery of the instruction. We will begin to introduce how to use learning aids in golf lessons and create effective practice routines for the students (Teaching B). Third, explore golf teaching methodologies of top teaching professionals.

Like PGA 105 and 205 this course will have four main areas of focus that build on previous topics. First, a focus on mental practice, motor imagery, and optimizing transfer. There will be a more detailed discussion on practice and how mental practice, motor imagery, and learning help affect the transfer of learning from the range to the golf course. There will be a higher level of discussion on how to avoid pitfalls of mental game and how to optimize playing performance (Learning C). Second, more focused discussion on how to create long-term processes for improvement as a teacher and for the students being taught. This will mean a greater focus on golfers that are already playing at a high level (Teaching C). Third, a focus on a great depth of teaching methodologies especially focusing on teaching advanced shot-making skills. Included will also be how to make the correct equipment suggestions and fitting for each individual player (Game C). Lastly, an emphasis on the business impact of teaching and player development programs. There will be an in-depth discussion on how to do a market assessment of teaching needs in the area and how that fits in and affects the facilities overall budget (Player Development C).

During the first half of the course students will explore the modern construct of \u201cvirtual\u201d, with the second half of the class dissecting the philosophical human perception of \u201creality\u201c itself. Typically Offered: Fall and Spring."
