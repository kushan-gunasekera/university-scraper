This course will address these and other questions by unpacking the famous Greek, Roman, and early-medieval historians and by considering how contemporary contexts shaped the writing of the past. This course offers a comparative cultural and literary approach to reading Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Tacitus, Ammianus Marcellinus, Procopius, Gregory of Tours, and Bede.

After independence, national culture has been a central issue. Writers in particular have played a key role addressing some of the major debates concerning religion, national tradition, language, music, and even the form of everyday life. In the past decades, writers have been engulfed in a new wave of cultural change as the North African populace has been deeply influenced by new Islamicist movements, and the politics of Arabicization.

We will further ask whether these developments have contributed to the health of American democracy. Have American evangelicals, for example, contributed to a democratic culture that depends on thoughtful deliberation over the good society or have they undermined common democratic values by seeking a theocratic republic? More generally, what should be the proper relationship between religion and democracy?"

Beginning with ancient forms of bound labor, it traces the growth of slavery in the Americas, built initially upon native slavery, but ultimately most successful with African workers. The course closely follows the rise of the transatlantic slave trade from Africa, which produced distinct and variable slave regimes in the Americas. In the process, the class will explore what the lived experiences were like for those who were enslaved, and includes considerations of modern forms of oppression."

How should such decisions be made? In this course we will look at quantitative tools, such as the QALY and DALY, increasingly being used to make policy decisions about health. We will investigate the philosophical assumptions underlying the measures and the ethical issues raised by their use. Along the way, we will discuss several general problems in the philosophy of economics. This course qualifies as a level-I elective in the economics major."

This course will present an overview of the history of textual interpretation, from its roots in Biblical study and ancient philosophy to more modern approaches such as Marxist literary criticism, psychoanalytic literary criticism, hermeneutics, structuralism, post-structuralism, and deconstruction. To this end we will read theoretical texts by Erich Auerbach, Roland Barthes, William Empson, I. A. Richards, Jacques Derrida and others. The main focus of the class, however, will be individual readings of poetic texts. Poets studied include, but are not limited to, Shakespeare, Keats, Wallace Stevens, T. S.

The Fatimids, who controlled a large portion of the Mediterranean, brought about a number of remarkable achievements under their rule: the founding of Cairo; unprecedented ritual pageantry surrounding the leader, the caliph-imam; and major advancements in theology, arts, and sciences. In this course we will think through major issues in the way political philosophy helped to guide the empire-issues such as the role of apocalypticism as a revolutionary theology; the place of secrecy in governing; and how religious symbolism could explain declines in political power. As the Fatimids were Shia, we will also cover various similarities and differences between Sunni and Shia political philosophies."

From a historical perspective, this course interrogates the creation of Amazonia from the nineteenth-century rubber boom to contemporary environmental campaigns.  We analyze visual images, explorers\u2019 accounts, ethnographies, novels, films, advertisements and environmental campaigns.  The point is to understand how the Amazon and its people have been imagined externally and internally, and why certain narratives hold power in the Western world."

This course will address these and other questions by unpacking the famous Greek, Roman, and early-medieval historians and by considering how contemporary contexts shaped the writing of the past. This course offers a comparative cultural and literary approach to reading Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Tacitus, Ammianus Marcellinus, Procopius, Gregory of Tours, and Bede. Continuities and differences in the historical portrayal of such themes as politics, violence, gender, and religion will receive particular attention."

Writers in particular have played a key role addressing some of the major debates concerning religion, national tradition, language, music, and even the form of everyday life. In the past decades, writers have been engulfed in a new wave of cultural change as the North African populace has been deeply influenced by new Islamicist movements, and the politics of Arabicization.

The war has also been crucial for the development of French culture and society. Indeed, the ghost of the Algerian war still haunts debates about immigration, French identity, the veil and the idea of the French Republic. In this course, we will investigate the ways in which the Algerian war has mediated and possibly shaped debates in literature, films, philosophy, and cultural life in both countries, from the beginning of the war until today."

As these differences suggest, disagreements among our nation\u2019s most prominent African American intellectuals run deep. They disagree, for example, over such fundamental questions as the significance of racism in modern America and the best means of achieving racial equality. Their varied perspectives have enriched and shaped our national conversation about race, and they continue to help all of us think more deeply about racial inequality-America\u2019s most enduring social and political problem."

This unit explores various evidence- and experience-based approaches to developing leaders and leadership. Attention is given to understanding psychological theories and models of change, how to enhance development of human and social capital, conceptualizing and leveraging network perspectives on developing shared leadership capacity, and leading development of self and others at individual and collective levels."

Moreover, increasingly a large body of epidemiological and sociological work demonstrates that social-cultural factors such as socioeconomic status, sex, and race/ethnicity are pivotal in understanding health.

The second focus comes in understanding the ways in which Israel has defined itself as a Jewish state, the role of religion in Israeli politics, law, and society, and the challenges to this identity, including the multiple forms of Jewish identity represented in Israel (e.g., secular, Haredi, Mizrahi), and the presence of large numbers of non-Jewish, Arab/Palestinian, citizens."

Many of these letters are deeply personal, disclosing the emotional lives of prominent social actors, and at the same time revealing priceless information about topics such as slavery, gender, religious life, and legal culture. Other letters are official government documents that provide otherwise inaccessible details about the ancient economy and government administration. Moreover, letters were understood to be gifts that enriched the lives and status of recipients. As such, they were crafted with literary artistry and often reveal the depth of ancient engagement with literature, history, and ethics. This seminar allows students to explore a select number of letter collections that are key to understanding the rich complexities of ancient life from the 2nd to 6th centuries CE."

While the most familiar are found in our temperate surroundings, arguably the most fascinating microorganisms are found thriving under extreme physical and geochemical conditions where very little non-microbial life exists. In this course we will critically examine how these extremophiles adapted to survive, how their activities affect global nutrient cycles, and what their existence may tell us about the origin of life on Earth as well as the potential for life to exist elsewhere in the solar system. Finally, we will explore the impact their discovery has had on the fields of medicine and biotechnology, as well as the chemical and pharmaceutical industries."
