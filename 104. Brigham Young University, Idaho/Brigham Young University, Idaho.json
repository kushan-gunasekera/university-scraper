Poets, musicians, painters, and authors have shaped us, whether we know it or not. As McCullough explains, \"We walk around everyday, everyone of us, quoting Shakespeare, Cervantes, Pope. We don't know it, but we are, all the time. We think this is our way of speaking. It isn't our way of speaking - it's what we have been given. The laws we live by, the freedoms we enjoy, the institutions that we take for granted...are all the work of other people who went before us.\" Through examination of modern literature, art, philosophy, and history, students will study significant people and cultures and apply principles learned to their unique life circumstances."

Students are expected to work 8 to 10 hours per week on the project for the duration of the semester to have a total of 100 hours minimum. Although ALPS projects happen offsite from the client's office, the experience it offers will be comparative to completing a part-time internship for a business. The experience begins with training sessions or recordings for the first two weeks. Project assignments are determined by student interest, abilities, and availabilities. To learn more about the ALPS basic program visit http://alps.rbdcenter.org/alps-basic/. This course is available to both online and on campus students.

Performance expectations should be measured both qualitatively and quantitatively, leading to a backlog of work for a software team. Following agile principles, a student leads their team for a period known as a sprint. During this sprint, team members collaboratively progress through the backlog of work.\n\nCentral for many software startups is the use of cloud technology to host and manage software. This course teaches the use of cloud through hands-on interaction with a cloud platform. Running code in the cloud is most successfully managed when running inside of virtual containers (ex: Docker containers). Students learn to create containers on their own laptops, and then to mirror or deploy them to the cloud. Beyond this, they create a code deployment pipeline that monitors Github for changes and automates this process.\n\nThe concept of disruption, explaining the wildly popular cloud, is discussed in depth in this course.

The ensemble often represents BYU-Idaho and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints through on and off campus performances of music that is \"virtuous, lovely, of good report or praiseworthy.\" The Spirit can be felt when practicing a worthy art in a wholesome environment for righteous purposes."

        "course_name": "The Search for Wisdom",
        "course_description": "This course is an introduction to philosophical thought as a method of seeking wisdom. Students learn the fundamental concepts and skills needed to understand and assess claims and theories. They apply these concepts and skills as they deal with important philosophical issues, for example, regarding the rationality of belief in God, the nature of truth and knowledge, the foundations of moral values, and happiness and the good life. Students also practice developing the intellectual virtues needed to deal effectively with such issues. To accomplish these goals, students practice articulating, assessing, and defending, both verbally and in writing, their own and others' best-reasoned judgments regarding crucial philosophical issues. To inform their thinking, they read and analyze important primary philosophical texts that deal with the issue at hand. This course involves close reading of 8-12 pages of primary philosophical texts for most class meetings and 12-15 pages of polished, well-reasoned argumentative writing over the course of the semester. Instructors may also include quizzes, exams, and other means of helping students to assess their mastery of course readings, concepts, skills, and objectives."
