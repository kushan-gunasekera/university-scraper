        "course_description": "Students study, and make, queer and trans art and games. Course considers how gender and sexuality are systems of rules often assumed in game design, and how those rules can be subverted to create novel and experimental games. By identifying and resisting cisnormativity and heteronormativity, students create original game concepts, using a critical, intersectional approach that understands that race as a constitutive element of both gender and sexuality. Course also studies with queer and trans ecologies understanding gender and race as inseparable from our idea of nature."

Themes include: questions of orientation and disorientation, production and annihilation, city and hinterland, interior and exterior, subjection and liberation. Also focuses on problems of race and class as they inform capitalism, and experiments with practices of psycho-geography on walks or \"drifts\" across campus. Thinkers discussed include Benjamin, Bachelard, Merleau-Ponty, Lefebvre, Debord, Harvey, Jameson, Gilmore, and others. (Formerly offered as Urban Consciousness: Life, Inequality, and the City.)"

Engages with re-emergences of Earth as a ground for shared ecological consciousness and belonging and with critiques of planetary epistemic colonialisms that erase human and non-human experiences and conflicts from Indigenous land relations to the reclaiming of soil materialities. Amid anxieties for the planet\u2019s future, we give attention to tensions between place-based ecological attachments and the perpetuation of nativist and nationalist exclusions, and to how Earth, land, and soil world-makings may appear uneven, unequal and divergent, common and uncommon, as well as inevitably interdependent."

        "course_description": "Probability and statistics underlie much of our everyday experience and, as such, there is a fundamental need for an understanding of the use, and misuse, of statistics. This course is taught through case studies based in biology, politics, economics, crime, education, disease, conservation, and other fields of interest. For example, does a change in crime rate really affect your probability of being a victim of a crime? The goal is to provide all students with sufficient understanding probability and statistics to determine if everyday and often sensationalistic reporting of statistical results is meaningful."

        "course_description": "Course stretches students' reflections on the nature of Christian mission and the work of missionaries, their imbroglio with and involvement in state and society, and how historical sourcing may impact the way we see things, lives, and our past. Begins in the 1st century BCE where Christianity emerged in West Asia and is organized chronologically through the 21st century. Course examines Christianity's expansion and external power and the competing views of it as rebellious, revolutionary and justice-oriented momentum versus a repressive conversion institution working politically, militarily, and economically. Also examines how the perception and strategy of Christian mission changed in time, region, groups, and individual missionaries, and how Christian mission, as a power, contributed to the regional and global changes."
