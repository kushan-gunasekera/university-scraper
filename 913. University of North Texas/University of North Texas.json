Consequently, our focus is as much on concepts and critical thinking as on content.

It seeks to make sense of the ways in which events and processes arising in one part of the world migrated to other places and intersected with local realities to produce new, and often unexpected, historical trajectories. The course is attentive to the unequal power relations which often underpinned the interactions between different societies. The course equally focuses attention on these interactions as key mechanisms in the creation of a modern global community.     "

According to the last U.S. census, the Latino/a population in the United States is the largest minority group in the country. This is by no means a minor social event in the history of the American continent. This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to the study of Americans of Latino descent in the United States across time and space. The course concentrates on two main issues: 1) the past and current social situation and cultural expressions of these groups within U.S. society; and 2) the construction of the terms \u201cHispanic\u201d and \u201cLatino/a\u201d as labels used to represent a diverse ethnic/cultural constituency. The course uses an array of interdisciplinary readings and other materials from the fields of history, political science, anthropology, sociology, literature and cultural studies.     "

It also examines how Latin American Cultural Studies addresses colonialism and postcolonial theories. The course operates with a broad understanding of culture, one that encompasses literatures, languages, political discourses, social movements, indigenous perspectives on colonialism and modernity, as well as different cultural production practices such as film, music, plastic art, theater and performace. Since Cultural Studies leads us to understand the politics of culture beyond the borders of disciplines, students in this course will experience a strong interdisciplinary approach to different practices and events through which culture either strengthens or counters structures of power.

Among the natural sciences, biological data can present particular challenges, such as a high amount of variability, as well as spatial and temporal correlation problems. We will discuss how to identify and mitigate these issues. Students should be prepared to work independently and in small groups on assignments and homework.

In this course we will explore both the current realities of indigenous cultures in parts of Latin America, as well as pre-Columbian and colonial antecedents.

Throughout the course, students also produce reflective and research-based writing that analyzes, synthesizes and articulates knowledge of the field of art and art making that contextualizes the student\u2019s creative art works. The seminar\u2019s collaborative framework and integrated set of experiences directs the student\u2019s production of creative art work, which includes assigned readings and discussion, research and writing, oral presentation, and group and individual critiques with faculty and visiting artists. The skills and abilities needed to successfully engage in the self-reflective and self-generating art making for this course have been introduced and practiced through assignments in previous courses taken at the 200 and 300-levels in the Art major. Personal accountability and effective work habits are developed through the effective combination of process and product in each student\u2019s self-proposed studio art works. The semester culminates in a group gallery exhibition and related written materials through which process students show evidence of their learned skills to leverage the strengths of others to achieve common goals, and organize, prioritize and delegate work. In order to accomplish these course goals, students are expected to show good progress throughout the semester, maintain regular studio work schedule outside of seminar meeting times and fully participate in all seminar meetings. To facilitate the ambition and focus required of advanced-level work, each student will be provided with and will be expected to effectively make use of assigned studio spaces in the department\u2019s communal senior studios in the Art Annex.

It will end with Richard Nixon and Watergate as the birth of a more cynical era. Within that timeframe, however, we will examine the many complex forces that came together in 1968 and do extensive reading and writing on how Americans dealt with the major issues of that day. Themes include the war in Vietnam, the counterculture, the rise of the Black Panthers, the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, the rise of the women\u2019s movement, the emergence of George Wallace, Richard Nixon\u2019s election and the rise of the \u201csilent majority,\u201d to name just a few.     "

This is by no means a minor social event in the history of the American continent. This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to the study of Americans of Latino descent in the United States across time and space. The course concentrates on two main issues: 1) the past and current social situation and cultural expressions of these groups within U.S. society; and 2) the construction of the terms \u201cHispanic\u201d and \u201cLatino/a\u201d as labels used to represent a diverse ethnic/cultural constituency.
