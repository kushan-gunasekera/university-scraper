The course's core set of theoretical and methodological tools helps students to engage with gaming critically and to create alternative games in the future.",

How do oral & aural culture manifest themselves in these works? What is the status of the (visually troubling) Black body in the line of text? What does Black abstraction make visible? We read Black poetry, criticism, cultural studies, & theory to move from these questions to new ones.",

This course serves as an introduction to the development, politics, and aesthetics of early modern French literary practices as they are contextualized in this global colonial history. By examining a number of early modern texts of a variety of genres-travel narratives, linguistic manifestoes, poetry, dialogues, and essays-this course will explore interconnections between the development of the French language and imperialism.",

The objective is to assess how and why environmental and societal factors and forces caused and shaped the conflicts and how in turn mass violence shaped societies and how they used and perceived their environments.",

Readings focus on the political, social, and cultural negotiations that shaped these processes. Key themes include indigeneity, political violence and dissent, migration, urbanization, capitalism and the environment, and Mexico's relationship with the U.S. We will also visit the university museum to analyze revolutionary art.",

Can it be improved? Through the study of texts that foreground Spanish across time and place, we explore the historical forces that have shaped Spanish and current debates about the state of one of the world's most widely spoken languages.",

If Monkey represents the spirit of play and the ability to change at will, how does remediation ask us to think about this in terms of media and philosophy, politics and language? When and how does adaptation turn into appropriation?",

It doesn't have to be so, especially if we combine the 'old ways' of learning it, with some of the most advanced and effective pedagogical methods known today. Led by shakuhachi master Riley Lee, students will explore basic theories of knowledge, and what it means to 'know' a piece in the culture-specific shakuhachi tradition. By learning to perform a short traditional piece, on instruments provided, we will learn both how to learn and how to 'practice' (anything) effectively. A side benefit might be an improvement of one's working memory.",

What are the politics of engaging with texts that have been used to underpin ideas of a superior Western civilization? What challenges do writers have to overcome in working with ancient texts? Students will consider these questions as readers but also as writers who will work towards a classics re-write of their own.",

Historically, utopia has largely been seen as a Western construct. But what models -and by extension potential solutions- does the non-Western world offer? This course examines utopia from a South Asian perspective. Considering a range of examples (the nation state, Maoist revolution, environmental movements, intentional communities), it asks how change occurs, and what cautionary lessons history offers those seeking a more perfect world.",

A child born in Spain today can expect to live to 83 years; a child born in Sierra Leone or Nigeria has a life expectancy of less than 55 years.  The likelihood of dying under the age of five is 20 times higher in sub-Saharan Africa than in Australia or New Zealand.  Who is responsible for this global calamity-rich countries, poor countries, you and me?  And what should be done?

The work of David, Cole, Church, Eakins, Manet, Courbet, Tanner, Inness, Van Gogh, and C\u00e9zanne will offer unique perspectives onto the modes of seeing and knowing that defined 19th-century culture.",

We study the optical effects that Baroque sculptors employed to rival the mimetic illusionism of painting, and consider these in relation to the coloristic ambiguity - and often the insistent tactility - of works carved by Renaissance sculptors. By considering the value and limits of painterly paradigms for making and viewing sculpture, our investigation seeks to understand the strategies sculptors used to assert the autonomy of their colorless art.",

While Maoist ideology and policies were homogenizing in intent and often in effect, this course will emphasize the ways in which the experiences of the Mao era were mediated through categories like gender, social status, and ethnicity.",

Many Americans--fed up with gerrymandering, political extremism, hyper-partisanship, structural racism, and legislative gridlock--are calling for reforms to how we vote, draw districts, and conduct primary elections.  If channeled successfully, reforms such as nonpartisan districting and ranked choice voting have the potential to renew democracy in the 21st century, much as the Progressive Era changed our country in the early 20th century.  Students will not only learn about these critical issues, but will engage in hands-on work for electoral reform in New Jersey.",

        "course_description": "This seminar grapples with the question of authorship and meaning in the literature of Jorge Luis Borges, the legendary Argentine writer whose convoluted fictions continue puzzling readers. Borges is a foundational figure. Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Paul Auster, and philosophers such as Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault, are all indebted to Borges. Using different perspectives, from philosophy and aesthetics to politics and cultural analysis, we will study Borges's thematic and formal obsessions: time and memory; labyrinths; reading as a form of writing; and the universality of Argentine local traditions such as tango and gaucho culture.",

Looking at literature, visual arts, memory museums, and film, the course will pay special attention to different articulations among visual, discursive, and territorial regimes of signification, from the 1950s to the present. Some classes will be held at the Art Museum in order to work with materials from the Latin American collection.",

Was the Haitian Revolution victorious thanks to strong military leaders or shrewd masses? Are films a fun escape or a means to rethink the world? How do people with little internet access make creative use of new media? How do we understand art's relation to history and politics? Readings include selections from the Black Radical tradition, Marxism, Feminism, Subaltern Studies, Aesthetics, as well as select examples from literature and film.

        "course_description": "When the name Miguel de Cervantes is mentioned, readers tend to think of the character Don Quijote-his idealism or madness. But beyond that, the book stages daring critiques of ethnicity, race, religion, gender, class, and human nature. Such Cervantine works as the 'Persiles' and the 'Novelas ejemplares', as well as his theater offer equally challenging responses to the hegemonic structures of the Spanish empire. By means of these texts and their historical and philosophical contexts, this course will examine Cervantes' questioning of many of the contested social and political structures in place during the turbulent times in which he lived.",

We will explore a variety of artifacts that discard the eyes in favor of experiences of blindness, obscured vision, and tactile sensation that interrogate the visual imperative. I propose that opacity, darkness, and blindness are poetic mechanisms that can stand up to the authoritarian regime of vision and question the insidious ways in which light suffuses peripheral knowledge, politics, and bodies.",

But some plays are more \"meta\" than others and the methods and motives of their authors vary considerably. This seminar will spend six weeks focused on Greek, Renaissance, and Modern examples of the genre before turning to contemporary American playwrights who have found new and often jaw-dropping uses for metatheatrics.",

Why, then, has the American theater so struggled to meaningfully address questions of equity, diversity and inclusion? In this course, we undertake a critical, creative and historical overview of agitation and advocacy by theater artist-activists aiming to transform American theatre-making as both industry and creative practice, as we connect those histories with the practices, structures and events determining the ways diversity is (and is not) a guiding principle of contemporary American theater.",
