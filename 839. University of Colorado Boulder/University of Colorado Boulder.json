Sometimes it\u00bfs called sustainability, sometimes the triple-bottom-line \u00bf but whatever the terminology, the realities of expanding economies, a growing population, and global warming are prying open our minds and forcing/enabling us to work in a way that is anything but business-as-usual.  The challenges are numerous, complex, and daunting. But in the final analysis, business is such a powerful engine that, when fueled by the strategies of sustainability, it presents us with a realistic and hopeful path forward. MGMT/CESR 4130, Sustainable Operations, will explore the new and rapidly evolving field of sustainability within the context of business operations in sectors like energy, transportation, food, sports and fashion, and will equip students with real-world examples, tools, and new ways to think about work."

How does this perceived holiness come about? What happens when holy places are destroyed and rebuilt? We will examine the biblical stories about Jerusalem not only as important sources themselves, but also for how they shape later religious traditions, specifically Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. As such, we will address what it means for the same place to be perceived as \u00bfholy\u00bf by differing, and often competing, groups. These contestations regarding Jerusalem will, then, allow us to engage issues of religious diversity and conflict both historically and in the present."
