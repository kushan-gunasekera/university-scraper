Visual material plays a special role in the reinforcement of conspiracy theories. Case studies around the world, from the Egyptian pyramids to the birth of \"modern\" art in the twentieth century, center on ways in which an evidence-based account of the making of an artwork or architectural site has been replaced by a (usually more interesting) story about its true, hidden nature. This story usually purports to reveal the \"conspiracy\" of an empowered institution or group to keep the truth away from average people.

Through critical consideration of the spectacle of racialized violence and the everyday micro-aggressions of the stereotype, addresses the ways that images harm. Also considers how just representation may offer restitution and repair. Explores forms of anti-racist visual activism that seize the power to look back. And questions the ethics of an assumed right to look and to take an image. In asking these imperative ethical and political questions about what images do, trains the critical capacity to harness and intervene in the powers of imaging. "

By the late 19th century, the West was an identifiable region with characteristic economic features, race relations, and federal ties, and it held a unique place in collective memory. In the 20th century, western distinctiveness faded in some ways and persisted in others, and western variants unfolded of the world wars, Depression, Cold War, and Vietnam War; civil rights; suburbanization and the New Right; environmentalism; immigration; and globalization. We employ economic, environmental, political, cultural, and social analyses, and attend to the dreams of many westerners: people of North American, Latin American, European, African, and Asian descent, and of all genders, classes, and sexualities.

Then, we examine the history of Latinx immigration to understand the experiences of Mexicans, Central Americans, South Americans, and people from the Caribbean who have immigrated to the US in search of economic opportunities and political asylum.

Latinxs became an important part of the US population through western expansion, conquest, and immigration. We will learn about the 3 main Latinx groups in the US: Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans, but will also learn about other Latinx communities. We begin with an examination of conquest by studying the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that annexed roughly half of former Mexican territory and the Spanish-American War that resulted in the possession of Puerto Rico. Then, we examine the history of Latinx immigration to understand the experiences of Mexicans, Central Americans, South Americans, and people from the Caribbean who have immigrated to the US in search of economic opportunities and political asylum. This course serves as an introduction to the varied experiences of Latinxs in the US in order to understand their unique histories. "

From the microbes that inhabit our guts to political revolutions sparked by a tweet, human lives are embedded in an ecology of complex, interdependent systems. Using the lens of Human Ecology, you will address \"big questions\" like: How am I connected to others and to larger systems? What brings happiness and works for the \"greater good\" in human lives? An overarching goal of the course is to help you understand yourself as embedded in the web of ever-evolving interconnected networks, an \"EcoYou.\" Human Ecology is a systems approach to studying and understanding relationships between humans and their everyday environments; it is a civic and socially conscious orientation that is committed to understanding and improving the quality of human lives. Human Ecology is inherently interdisciplinary drawing on research, theories and methods from diverse fields such as sociology, psychology, anthropology, economics, public health, biology, and art and design.

These discussions will develop familiarity with important concepts in Black studies and social theory such as race and colonialism, imperialism and hegemony, structure and agency, identity and strategic essentialism. Weekly readings will typically pair writings specifically on HipHop with theory from across the humanities and social sciences including philosophy, sociology, cultural studies, and political economy.

Through readings and discussions of novels, avant-garde manifestoes, poems, two main tasks will be accomplished. The first task of analyzing literary texts in a variety of genres (epistolary novel, historical novel, avant-garde rhetoric, poetry) to familiarize ourselves with textual analysis and some theoretical tools supporting the interpretative tasks of literary criticism. And the second task of appreciating the rhetorical devices that those texts adopt at different times of Italian modern and contemporary history."

Taking a comparative approach, analyzes several major conflicts of the twentieth century, from World War I to the wars of decolonization, and from the genocide of the Herero peoples to the Armenian Genocide, the Holocaust, and beyond. Key topics include the genealogy of the modern idea of \"race\" in Europe and the U.S.; the drive towards a world of more homogeneous nation-states after World War I; and the emergence of transnational protest movements opposed to racism, imperialism, antisemitism, and Islamophobia. Drawing on a range of texts, songs, and films, investigates new connections between Europe and the United States. Take an international look at concepts like race and nation, and try to make sense of extreme violence, war-making, and the pre-requisites of peace. "

        "course_description": "Soccer (or football) is played in almost every part of the world. Soccer will be used as a lens through which to think critically about a range of issues within our own societies and around the world. This includes examining the relationship between European imperialism and the globalization of soccer in the early 20th century; thinking about who gets to play (and who gets paid) across different contexts; and analyzing how soccer is both globally networked and intensely local in its passions and rivalries. Draws from a range of perspectives on soccer, from those who consider it to be an opium for the masses to those who see it as a vehicle for positive social change, in order to illuminate some of the big questions facing the world today.

Europeans now learned to live with violence, both during as well as after the war, and found new ways to mourn or remember the dead.
