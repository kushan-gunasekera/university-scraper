        "course_description": "<p>Real estate has increasingly become a compelling force in the process of city making, one uniquely capable of leading and guiding multiple steps in the construct of vital urbanism: from conceiving an idea to constructing complex structures; from sourcing funding to creating master-planned communities; and from negotiating design forms to implementing urban public realms. &nbsp;</p><p>A country like China is at once experiencing rapid urbanization while undergoing an unprecedented transformation in the mechanism of city making: the forces of real estate and the shifting roles played by public and private sectors are constantly challenging conventional city-building models, while defining and redefining their positions in the production of the built environment.</p><p>This course, conducted as a research seminar, focuses on the interdependence between real estate and city making. It addresses both theoretical and empirical investigations on the concepts and paradigms that have shaped and are still shaping real estate practices and their impact on contemporary Chinese cities. The course critically examines emergent real estate and urban development strategies, their respective financing structures, underlying domain expertise, urban organizational hierarchy, and the impacts of the success and failure of China&rsquo;s real estate dynamics on the city-making process.</p><p>Thus, the pedagogical approaches of the course are as follows:<br />1. to familiarize students with many aspects of real estate issues, especially those intersected with physical design and planning methods in the process of city making<br />2. to introduce students to frameworks in approaching an unfamiliar real estate market<br />3. to expose students to the linkage between real estate and city-making parameters, using China as a case study</p><p>Students will work independently and in teams on selected themes to identify critical forces in real estate development and investment: how key real estate players, domestic or international, have formed their central business strategies, interacted with capital markets, and participated in the city-making process to facilitate and drive the formation of the built environment; and how emergent private sector leaders are integrating human capital, financial capital, and design intelligence, to reshape the form and composition of urban centers within China and beyond. With the investigative research framework set at the beginning of the semester, students will proceed to examine the city-making process through the lens of real estate, design, planning, finance, and land ownership structure, in parallel with readings and class discussions, to anticipate the trajectory of contemporary real estate development and city making. The class meets once a week and is open to students from all programs at the GSD as well as students from other departments or schools within Harvard University.&nbsp;</p>"

A thesis is typically developed through a piece of original research specific to an academic discipline, often at the culmination of a program of study. Theses are produced through various methods as appropriate to the disciplinary commitments of academic fields across the research university. Design theses are pursued through the methods and media specific to the design disciplines, through design research. Design research most often refers to the process and products of knowledge produced through design, as distinct from knowledge produced by research methods associated with the humanities or the sciences. Design research can be characterized by its means and methods, as well as by its sites and subjects for work, as well as the dissemination and reception of its propositions.</p><p>Design research is propositional and projective rather than simply empirical or descriptive. It is most often predicated on intervention in the world rather than simply describing the world as found. Design research is characterized by its capacity to propose alternative and better futures while simultaneously producing disciplinary knowledge in design. Candidates in the Master in Landscape Architecture Program elect to pursue independent design theses at the culmination of their graduate work. The projects presented here represent original thematic propositions put forward through design research to stimulate discussion and debate. In this sense, they are as much about design discourse and disciplinary formation as they are propositions for how things ought to be.</p><p>This research seminar is intended for Master in Landscape Architecture candidates electing to pursue a design thesis in their final year of study. The course defines the parameters of a design thesis and assists candidates in the development of their own individual design thesis proposals. The course addresses a series of broad themes essential to developing a cogent thesis proposal including design research, projective practices, discursive agendas, site contexts, programmatic drivers, and representational strategies. The course examines the role of precedent projects and design methods as well as the status of design and design research as forms of knowledge in the research university.</p><p>Course readings, video lectures, and videos of advice from faculty and recent graduates are made available via Canvas. The course&nbsp; meets weekly for workshop presentations and discussion of thesis projects in development. In addition to the regularly scheduled class sessions, tutorial workshops, and formal reviews, individual meetings with faculty advisors are an important aspect of the course. Students will be invited to identify and secure a GSD faculty thesis advisor by the end of August. By the end of the term candidates will prepare an independent thesis proposal of their own formulation as a critical contribution to contemporary discourse and debate in landscape architecture. The course welcomes individual design thesis projects exploring topics of contemporary relevance to the future of landscape architecture including questions of racism and resistance, class and climate, among others.</p>"

We are inundated by rhetoric about green infrastructure, social infrastructure, global infrastructure, and so on. Yet, infrastructural work in practice often seems to be more about reinforcing the status quo than about building new connections or enabling new ways of living.&nbsp;</p><p>This Open Project is invested in the design of &ldquo;experimental infrastructures&rdquo; that can interject new narratives into society. It will proceed by simultaneously engaging in critical studies of physical infrastructure (existing and speculative) as well as cultivating practices of &ldquo;infrastructural thinking&rdquo; &ndash; a network-based framework of inquiry into a range of social technologies, including time, money, language, statistical models, algorithms, academic disciplines, and other belief systems of all sorts as world-ordering logics. We will ask how these systems become hidden underground, behind walls, in technical documents, as well as behind common sense, the status quo, sunk costs, cultural heritage, and &ldquo;expertise.&rdquo; We will, in other words, ask about all things that behave infrastructurally.</p><p>The class will start with a survey of critical infrastructure studies, an interdisciplinary approach that questions how various infrastructures have been designed, built, and maintained in ways that reinforce social structures. We will discuss how &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; is a term with a specific history, though it has come to encompass a wide range of networks, systems, and tools, and we will use this critical historical approach to map out the political life of the concept and its expansion. After building a theoretical framework that allows us to interrogate infrastructure as a &ldquo;master narrative&rdquo; that shapes social relations and the built environment and as a &ldquo;second nature&rdquo; that disciplines landscapes and ecosystems, we will then attempt to reimagine infrastructure as a tool for radical change. What, for example, might an explicitly feminist infrastructure look like? A queer infrastructure? An anticolonial infrastructure? An anti-racist infrastructure? An infrastructure of degrowth? An infrastructure of care? A nonhuman infrastructure? (Etc.)</p><p>To engage in this rethinking, it will be necessary to confront the complicity of infrastructure within historical projects of global economic growth, nationalism, urbanization, resource extraction, and other world-making projects positioned as necessary public goods, but which have in practice led to gross injustices and inequalities. Our alternative infrastructures may prove to have dystopian tendencies, as well, and we will grapple with that complexity through individual and shared research throughout the semester.</p><p>Final projects may involve individual or collective work, writing and/or design, aimed at theory and/or practice.

        "course_description": "<p>In considering the social dimension of space, the designer, (architect, landscape architect, urban designer, artist) is called to engage reality in all its messiness, indeterminacy and complexity, not only as a sensible response to the challenges of continuing to live our contemporary notion of the &ldquo;good life&rdquo;, but as an essential premise of action in the world. This messy, complex reality IS the public realm, where people &ndash; distinct and equal &ndash; exist together.</p><p>The Open Project &ldquo;Revisiting the Space of Appearance and the implication of the Self&rdquo; represents an homage to the intellectual contributions of George Baird&rsquo;s The Space of Appearance published in 1995, which builds on Hannah Arendt&acute;s conception of the public realm as the space where &ldquo;I appear to others as others appear to me.&rdquo; The performative demand posed by this spatial stage calls on each individual to conjure up their most precious ethical enactment.</p><p>As we face the mounting threats to human livelihood posed by climate change and escalating inequality, an ethical insurrection appears to be essential. Disquietingly neutralized by justifications of &ldquo;the good life&rdquo;, economic development and even the exercise of freedom, responsibility for these threats is deflected toward abstract concepts including technology, economy, politics, consumption, pleasure-seeking etc. The implication of the self &ndash; our own personal agency &ndash; remains comfortably at bay.</p><p>In this sense, facilitating the enactment of spaces of appearance becomes ever more critical. Baird suggests this would require a different form of practice. He argues that it will not be an altogether conscious commitment, forms will emerge reconstituted in new ways from previous models, as a concatenation of pluralistic heterogeneous public positions. Perforce, projects will surface from existing social and economic energies, with the potential to voice passionate symbolic interpretations, the social meaning of which we will not be able to determine ourselves. No prot&eacute;g&eacute; will claim authenticity. &ldquo;We may say that as architects, we will not be able to see altogether clearly the consequences of these efforts on our own but will be able to rest confident that they will appear clearly and unmistakably to others.&rdquo; The designer (architect, landscape architect, urban designer, artist) unlearns existing inherited dynamics and becomes an interpreter, someone that enables critical processes &ldquo;appearing in space&rdquo;, rather than defining outcomes a priori.</p><p>The pertinence of this way of understanding the role of the designer is justified in its potential to encourage people to change their lives. Appearing in an inclusive public space, exercises the &ldquo;self&rdquo;. In time he or she becomes a virtuoso in the art of living together, of conviviality, and respect &ndash; for their own community, otherness, the environment, the non-human world etc.</p><p>This Open Project may interest candidates in all disciplinary backgrounds and MDes domains who are keen on developing alternative practices.

While the representation of alternative and better futures has been central to the history of the design disciplines, the scope and scale of anthropogenic climate change presents unique challenges to the traditional training and skill sets of the design professional. As communities confront the various catastrophes, slow and less so, associated with changing climate, designers are increasingly called upon to communicate with various audiences on a range of topics. These include scientific data or geospatial models, future extreme weather events and their impacts, as well as their implication for public health and safety. Equally, designers are expected to be technically proficient and literate in the languages of various scientific, technical, economic, or political realms while communicating with decision-makers as well as broad public audiences. The representation of risk will be a central preoccupation.</p><p>Members of the project will be invited to curate a range of precedents and practices on the representation of risk and communication on climate adaptation from around the world. These comparative precedents and practices will form an archive of sorts from which members of the project will develop their own unique design research projects. This MDes Open Project invites members from all disciplinary and professional backgrounds across all MDes domains. Members of the project will be invited to identify their particular preferred media for design research on communication in relation to climate adaptation. MDes candidates are invited to work through media that they have previous experience or expertise with, or to identify new or emergent media that they have little or no experience with. The project engages with a range of leading designers and thinkers whose practices offer productive models for thinking through these questions. These interventions include lecture presentations, seminar discussions, and workshops on particular media.</p><p>As designers and researchers confront the challenges of climate adaptation their work necessarily implicates questions of communication with and between diverse audiences. This MDes Open Project proposes the development of innovative and unique models of communication on a range of topics associated with climate adaptation. These research projects will be developed through a combination of collective research on precedents and best practices across various media, the arts, and design. These include, but are not limited to, narrative storytelling and ethnographic study, time-based media including video and animation, machine learning and artificial intelligence, gaming and virtual or augmented reality, web platforms and apps, cartographic and geospatial modeling, graphic novels and illustration, graphic design and communication design, among other media and modes of communication.</p><p>The precedents and best practices informing the work will be drawn from around the world and members of the course are invited to bring their own previous work on the topic of climate adaptation as it relates to the topic of communication. Those precedents and practices will inform the development of individual or collective design research projects in relation to the Office for Urbanization&rsquo;s ongoing research on climate adaptation on Cape Ann, Massachusetts. The communities of Gloucester, Manchester-by-the Sea, Essex, and Rockport will provide test beds for communication with decision-makers, civic society, and local audiences.

The course introduces students to landscape as a form of cultural production, as a mode of human subjectivity, as a medium of design, as a profession, and as an academic discipline. Through lectures, discussions, readings, and case study projects, students will be introduced to landscape through the lenses of capital, labor, material, subject, and environment. The first half of the course revisits the origins of landscape in response to the societal and environmental challenges of industrialization and the attendant transformations in industrial economy shaping the modern metropolis. The second half of the course repositions recent discourse on landscape as urbanism in relation to the economic and territorial transformations associated with ongoing urbanization at the planetary scale.<br />&nbsp;<br />The first quarter of the course introduces the origins of landscape as a genre of painting and the invention of the &lsquo;new art&rsquo; of landscape architecture as responses to urbanization and their attendant social, economic, and cultural transformations. This portion of the course describes the material and cultural contexts in which landscape was conceived as well as the sites and subjects it invoked. The second quarter of the course describes the emergence of city planning from within landscape architecture and the subsequent impoverishment of the field in the absence of its urban contents. This portion of the course introduces the aspirations and implications of ecologically informed regional planning in the 20thcentury, as well as the ongoing ideological effects of that agenda in the context of neoliberalism.<br />&nbsp;<br />The third quarter of the course introduces the discourse and practices of landscape urbanism over the past two decades. This portion of the course surveys the discursive and projective potentials of an ecological urbanism, as distinct from those of ecological planning, and speculates on the recent formulation of projective ecologies, among other discursive formations shaping the field. The final quarter of the course follows the transition from region to territory, and from regional urbanization to planetary urbanization.

Landscape architecture is one of these forces.</p><p>Borrowing the title from Stephen Jay Gould&rsquo;s book on the history of geology, this course will deal with the temporal dimension of landscape. As Henri Bergson said, time is invention, creation of forms. As a result of the interaction of different forces, the environment is in a continuous state of transformation, a state of becoming of which we are not always aware. In this course, we will investigate these notions through lectures, discussion, and drawings on theories of ecology, geomorphology, evolution, and thermodynamics, all concerned with the kinds of order that emerge over time as different forms of energy&mdash;radiant, potential, kinetic, chemical, and so on&mdash;inject life and motion into matter and thus into landscape.</p><p>In addition to the collective discussion around these topics, each student in the course will choose and graphically investigate a vernacular landscape, i.e., a space on the face of the earth resulting from the intersection of human technology with a preexisting geomorphological configuration, which has evolved slowly through the cultural practices of those who inhabit it. In selecting these landscapes, we will work to collectively cover the broadest possible range of environmental conditions around the world: from the very hot to the very cold, the very dry to the very wet, the very high to the very low, the very steep to the very flat. With the impacts of climate change in mind, we will focus on landscapes that arise from extreme conditions, such as deserts, rainforests, tundras, deltas, and great mountain ranges. Through drawing, we will reveal their climatic and geomorphological processes and constraints and the specific technologies that intervene in them and from which they receive their forms. This representational inquiry will help us visualize the theoretical component of the seminar, allowing the class to engage in a more productive conversation about the metaphysics of energy and matter, time and life, the different propensities that exist on earth prior to human intervention, and how design and technology interfere with, accelerate, slow down or even eliminate them.</p><p>Students will be assessed on their graphic investigation and contribution to the class discussion.

        "course_description": "<p>In the early 1950s, British architects Alison and Peter Smithson announced their arrival with a call for a &ldquo;new brutalism&rdquo;&mdash;a polemic sketched out over several years through texts and building projects. Describing new brutalism as an ethic, not a style, the Smithsons aimed to meet the changing needs and desires of postwar society through an architecture that directly expressed the material conditions of its time. Their friend and critic Reyner Banham defined a new brutalist building by its &ldquo;1. Memorability as an image; 2. clear exhibition of structure; 3. valuation of materials for their inherent qualities &lsquo;as found,&rsquo;&rdquo; and argued for &ldquo;the threat and the promise&rdquo; of such &ldquo;bloody-minded&rdquo; work within an increasingly staid culture of modern architecture. In contrast to the style that came to be known as brutalism, the new brutalism anticipated diverse and fertile trajectories: playful, ironic, and critical uses of found objects and materials in the manner of Dada, Pop and art brut; both high-tech and crude explorations of the limits of functional, technological and/or ecological determination and expression; close attention to ordinary and economical forms of construction and use.</p><p>Today, the imperatives of the new brutalism almost perfectly articulate a latent theory of architecture that connects a number of contemporary practices (none more notable than 2021 Pritzker Laureates Lacaton &amp; Vassal). Working through the associative logic that characterized the Smithsons&rsquo; practice, this seminar appropriates the new brutalism as a &ldquo;found&rdquo; theory of the present, exploring its relevance as a design methodology rooted in material economy, spatial flexibility, structural expression, and disregard for prevailing aesthetic conventions. What do the ethics of these working methods offer architects at a time of acute social and environmental crises? How do such ethics relate to the stylistic affections of an image-saturated architectural culture?</p><p>The semester will begin with a close reading of primary texts and projects related to the new brutalism, including a visit to the Smithsons&rsquo; archive, which is held at Loeb Library. Working individually or in small teams, students will then define and interrogate a contemporary manifestation of a newer brutalism at work in the field today. This research and speculation may be oriented around a specific design practice, cultural context, construction method, building type or even single building. This research will be supported by course readings and lectures that focus on how architectural form relates to authorship, tectonics, labor, use and the environment. Students will also be expected to share relevant readings and references with their colleagues as they discover them in the course of their work. Projects will develop through a cumulative series of exercises that involve collecting materials and images, developing simple diagrams, and writing short texts&mdash;this work will be organized and communicated in a small pamphlet, to be presented at the conclusion of the course.</p><p>The seminar is open to students of any background or program, and may offer a particularly useful opportunity for those students who are considering related questions in upcoming thesis work.</p>"

Diverse cultures have provided varied interpretations of urban grid systems that serve as an active underlay for multiple urban domains: street networks, public spaces, and a diversity of grain, responding to many different development strategies. Then is an &ldquo;open process&rdquo; to designing the city. &nbsp;</p><p>On the contrary, large fragments of our territories are reorganized by &ldquo;big Projects&rdquo;, like Expos. We highlight the importance of local factors (climate, urban context, political governance) that make them unique in each of the realities in which they are set. However, some conditions are repeated over time, such as the fact that they are ephemeral and always presented with great spectacularity.&nbsp; By definition, the Expo serves to demonstrate the future, pressing it as an innovative aspect by means of constructions (such as infrastructural inventions, symbolic landmarks, hybrid morphologies, parks with multifunctional areas) that come to represent specific times. This could still be one of the challenges of Expos in the future.</p><p>In the last few decades, urban interventions have reached an unprecedented level of complexity and ambition, increasing the level of design operations. In this time, the value and metrics of the grid and network have likewise become more operative than ever, and in more inventive ways than in the past. The new spatial demands of contemporary society require more flexible and open-ended systems. The Expo is ephemeral, but it has a big impact on the host city. This apparent contradiction is a fundamental element in the seminar, because the Expo can be both the germ of future urban sectors and an element of transition towards less predictable developments. Then its urbanistic legacy can be presented as a different &ldquo;open process&rdquo; to build a large urban fragment, inducing other uses around it.</p><p>The course targets understanding both the theories and &ldquo;project&rdquo; features that make grids&mdash;their design and/or their construction of the city&mdash;relevant and of interest to the current issues of contemporary cities. The ultimate objective of the course is to develop new understandings of the ways we are approaching the design of the city by means of &ldquo;grids and networks&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;special urban fragments&rdquo; confronting the new urban challenges of the 21st century.</p><p>The class contains eleven lectures and three seminal research assignments with presentations. From architectural and urbanistic perspectives, the lectures intend to help the audience build an academic understanding of the evolution of the ways in which cities have been designed, developed, and discussed across history. The study of these components builds an understanding of how &ldquo;urban grids&rdquo; or &ldquo;big projects&rdquo; can be designed as &ldquo;open forms&rdquo; that allow cities to incorporate changes and to be resilient to society&rsquo;s demands.</p>"

We will explore the sources, significances, and receptions of our work&rsquo;s expression and posture. Our aim will be to develop better understandings and instruments through which to exploit how architecture is made both legible and actionable to its audience.</p><p>The labels attached to architecture&rsquo;s visual bearing speak to its fickle nature across schools of thought: envelope, enclosure, fa&ccedil;ade, elevation, composition, index, form, representation, symbol, skin&hellip;the list is long and points in disparate directions. For an architect, pausing over questions of what architecture looks like can induce an unease about architecture&rsquo;s perimeter that may nudge us toward the safe haven of impartial or veiled expression, specious as that may or may not be.</p><p>And yet, architecture&rsquo;s appearance tantalizes. With reason.</p><p>In both literal and cultural senses, appearances tender architecture&rsquo;s most immediate entry point. What a building looks like trades on the extremes of a building&rsquo;s physical and metaphysical demands. Appearance is at times the result of something akin to pure science (as in building construction or optics) and at other times marinated in various combinations of significance, beauty, and appropriateness&hellip;the wooliest of architectural pursuits.</p><p>Regardless of what we may want to do with it, architecture gives us no choice: it will appear. We will see our architectures as objects and look into and past their literalities in search of what they might signal. We will take hold of them as exteriors and interiors. And we will react to them in ways that are visceral. Our buildings don&rsquo;t just appear. They entice, loom, defend, and evaporate.</p><p>Two corrective lenses, related to each other, will be important to our semester.</p><p><em>Lens One - Appearance and Action</em><br />We will spend the semester discussing architecture&rsquo;s appearance. With no desire to temper or sidestep that conversation, we will also take up a re-aligned version of Hannah Arendt&rsquo;s &ldquo;space of appearance,&rdquo; in which she poignantly lays out &ldquo;the various forms in which the public realm can be organized.&rdquo; With Arendt&rsquo;s evocative thoughts as background, this seminar might be thought of as centering on the &lsquo;appearance of space,&rsquo; an easy rearrangement of Arendt&rsquo;s phrase meant to stay close to her assertion that &ldquo;the only indispensable material factor in the generation of power is the living together of people.&rdquo; Architecture may well be our only hope vis-&agrave;-vis what she called &ldquo;the potentiality of being together.&rdquo;</p><p>Because architecture&rsquo;s appearance reaches into the very nature of public life, and because both architecture and public life thrive on possibilities more than certainties, we will begin with the hypothesis that architectural appearances are particularly well suited to cajoling public life. Another way to put this: Public life ought to exist because of architecture&rsquo;s appearance&hellip;and never despite it.</p><p><em>Lens Two &ndash; Time to Move Along</em><br />Occasionally, I&rsquo;m skeptical of architectural postmodernism&rsquo;s appearance/re-appearance in our discipline. On all other days, I&rsquo;m hostile to it. Anyone interested in this seminar should be aware that we will not take up postmodernism other than to establish a parallel conversation that might, on some days, dip into being complementary.</p>"

Purpose-built housing today is disconnected from these issues. It responds to the diversity of lifestyles in cities by partitioning citizens through different sectors, such as luxury housing, social housing, student housing, housing for the elderly, affordable housing, or housing for the homeless, rather than addressing them in an integrated and inclusive way. Housing for each of these &lsquo;sectors&rsquo; is also frequently provided in different areas of the city, amplifying the segregation of members of society from one another, instead of fostering interdependencies and a sense of community. Regardless of which sector it is designed for, it provides a standard, inflexible type of apartment, conceived around the ideals of a nuclear family, which denies the existence of diverse households in the city.

In search for freedom in aesthetics, the disciplines of architecture and structural design have always worked hand in hand in expanding new possibilities for form finding and space making. Rationality is the central tenant of the modernist&rsquo;s approach to architecture, tracing back to the traditions of logic and order of the Classicism of Greece and Rome. There have been two major trajectories in architecture within the structural conceptual approach in the period since the beginning of the 20th century. The first is the gradual reduction of mass, as exemplified in the Maison Domino and the Miesian language. The other is the transition from clear Euclidian geometries in spatial structures - such as the Pantheon - to a return to naturalism and free forms.</p><p>This seminar highlights the collaboration between architects and structural designers in the pursuit of new possibilities of form making. The guiding doctrine in this collaborative relationship has been that of structural rationalism, as expounded upon by the work of Brunelleschi and Viollet-le-Duc. Loads are the fundamental requirements of constructing architecture. We will look at the works on the collaboration of architect Louis Kahn with engineer August Komendant, Renzo Piano with Peter Rice, Rem Koolhaas with Cecil Balmond, Toyo Ito and Kazuyo Sejima with Mutsuro Sasaki, and Junya Ishigami with Yasutaka Konichi, among others.

It further engages in critical discussions, on how to create meaningful spatial interventions and urban transitions, that can foster more sustainable, livable, and equitable cities.</p><p>This seminar&rsquo;s aim is to establish a method to analyze and use existing urban situations and context as a driver in design development. Students will work in pairs for this assignment, which consists of two parts.</p><p>In Part One, they will analyze how the existing context and the analysis hereof can inform spatial interventions by reviewing literature and examining current and past architectural practices. All students will read and discuss the provided literature, with each group responsible for reviewing one text. Additionally, each student group will analyze a contemporary urban design project. The focus is on how existing urban situations influence spatial interventions and designs, exploring the relationship between urban situations and context, concept, and final design. The analysis also addresses the specific tools/methods used in the analysis of urban situations and contexts and in the translation into design concepts. Students also evaluate how the spatial intervention aims to improve the area and express their opinions on its success.</p><p>In Part Two, each student group individually analyzes a designated Boston site using tools from Part One. It is crucial to explore various analytical tools across scales and subjects, critically assessing analyses in relation to the case-study area and discussing them in terms of identified potentials for spatial interventions. Based on their analysis, each group will propose a spatial intervention that positively impacts the site and context, addressing aspects such as community building, resilience, connectivity, or housing. The concepts should be presented through diagrams or collages, serving as initial ideas pointing towards the development of design projects.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>The field of urban design is undergoing a process of major transformation. Josep Llu&iacute;s Sert&rsquo;s initial definition as the space between planning and architecture, emphasizing the culture of cities as &ldquo;civic culture&rdquo; and proposing pedestrian interaction as the &ldquo;underlying coherence&rdquo; of the work developed at different scales, followed his reinterpretation of the CIAM. This began at the GSD in 1956 with the Urban Design Program and has evolved continuously for seven decades. This Seminar sets out to contribute to redefining urban design by enhancing theoretical principles and exploring innovative practices in the field.</p><p>Industrialization and progress guided development throughout the 20th century, resulting in financial globalization, and the advancement of forms of communication and digital development. The emergence of new forms of economy that impact the conception and design of the city allows us to consider more creative alternatives to those of the prevailing globalization process. This is the framework in which we wish to situate discussion in the Seminar.</p><p>Defining this new urban field calls for a more in-depth study of projects that represent the roles or issues that urban design can address. It also requires us to produce design actions and strategies within the urbanistic discipline through research and practice. The design of the present-day city must consider environmental and climate challenges, digital impact, a knowledge-based economy, multiple and changing modes of mobility, as well as the more demanding aspirations of an older and more educated population.</p><p>The Seminar method is based on facing today&rsquo;s challenges by considering ongoing projects or research that allow us to understand that development is not linear and univocal; rather there are open and varied solutions centring on housing, energy, transport, etc. The process is a plural one, and the solutions in each case depend largely on the context, including aspirations, limitations, and available technologies.</p><p>The Seminar is based on research into sixteen topics that define current thinking and practice of urban design and projecting them into the future. We are selecting certain topics and case studies to advance the discussion of theoretical background, design tools, development process, and the conditions of agency and governance. Topics are structured within a theoretical framework, using relevant case studies and key projects to show the scope and conditions for the development of each chapter. Research is organized in four blocks corresponding to different scales and approaches, and an introduction.</p><p>The four main blocks are:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Long-term strategies operating at different scales.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Systematic forms of transition from the present-day city.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Infilling and upgrading.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Experimenting with new design issues.</p><p>Above all, we will be interested in the way this discipline develops plans, projects, and strategies, within the extraordinary complexity of today&rsquo;s urban design field. Because, to quote Lesley Lokko at the 2023 Venice Biennale, &ldquo;it is impossible to build a better world if we cannot first imagine it&rdquo;.</p>"

This is a good time to bring voices into the discussion that have long been excluded from impactful discussions about the future of humanity: voices of indigenous people, whose received wisdom reflects millennia of sustainable living in their respective contexts. Some of this wisdom has been worked out in distinctive indigenous philosophies, and the focus of this class is to explore some of these philosophies and assess what lessons they teach for the technological age. A focus is on indigenous authors from the U.S., but we encounter authors and perspectives from all continents. Topics we explore through the lens of indigenous philosophies include attitudes towards nature; views on technology generally; the Anthropocene; traditional ecological knowledge; artificial intelligence; genome-editing; geo-engineering; human rights; and the meaning of life. Engaging with indigenous perspectives on these matters is likely to have a transformative effect on how one approaches the big questions of the 21st century.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>Our aim is to address the general rupture caused by the rise of modernity&mdash;that is, by the social, economic, technological, and ideological transformations accompanying the political and industrial revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This was an age of internationalization in design practices and issues, a process that was accompanied by technological transformation and utopian thinking as well as by rising tensions linked to social inequality, colonial expansionism, and political upheaval. Our work in this course will look at the three pillars of buildings, texts, and contexts in order to find the equilibrium between, on the one hand, localized historical narratives and, on the other, the sampling to which a global purview necessarily gives rise.</p><p>The transition of architecture to the modern world prompts a series of fundamental questions: How did historical conditions place pressure on the tradition-bound parameters of architecture, on its origins, theories, and pedagogies? How did new conditions of scientific possibility actively reconfigure architecture&rsquo;s relation to engineering and ideologies of progress? And how, finally, did aesthetic conceptions and approaches, which trace an arc from the demise of the Vitruvian tradition to eclecticism, historicism, and rationalist avant-gardes, intersect with gender, race, society, and politics?</p><p>This course weaves these questions through topics and themes ranging from technology and utopia to ornament and imperialism. We begin with late Baroque polemics and the disintegration of the Classical system. We consider the multifaceted nature of eighteenth- century architectural expressions in such examples as: the ideal city from royal Jaipur to revolutionary Paris, the split between architects and engineers; origin myths and the status of history; and the formulation of building typologies from churches and factories to slave plantations in colonial contexts. The nineteenth century, which for us is inaugurated by a utopian imaginary, covers key episodes such as utopian socialism in the context of the Industrial Revolution, town planning and racial politics after the Civil War, the Beaux-Arts system in Europe, China, and the Americas, the intertwining of ornament and British imperialism in India, the collision of vernacular traditions and colonial modernity in Africa, and, finally, the global dream of colossal structures and the infrastructural programs of the modern metropolis.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>Designed gardens and landscapes are cultural artifacts that encompass three main expectations: pragmatic needs, cultural significance, and aesthetic order. Although some landscape narratives often ignore needs (those of the users or the environment&rsquo;s), reduce cultural meanings to a discourse on style, and focus on order as a problem in aesthetic theory, the fact remains that, almost without exception, one or more of these three criteria&mdash;needs, meanings, order&mdash;dominates the designed gardens and landscapes of every time and place. However, because gardens and landscapes are ephemeral and subject to many transformations, this course will consider their practical, cultural, and aesthetic aspects as embedded in a palimpsest of changing values. In order to do this, the course will not be structured around landscape architectural styles. Rather, it will examine a selection of topics that bring together thinkers and designers who live/have lived centuries apart. This will allow the class to unfold several issues that have shaped the profession through built work and intellectual inquiry, such as the recent reckoning about the discipline&rsquo;s role and agenda, questions of race and the implicit violence of white archives and memorials, and the limits of the commonly accepted, tripartite taxonomy of nature&mdash;pristine, productive and genteel, with its implicit prioritization of the latter category at the expense of the first two or of anything in between.</p><p>Instructor&rsquo;s talks will address contemporary designs alongside those conceived and implemented by our predecessors.

At the same time, these changing relationships between objects, their producers and maintainers, and their audiences and consumers were brought forth by the development of extractive projects that transformed human relations with the land and its constituents. A history of modern architecture, then, must involve a robust theory of the producing, using, viewing subject as well as of the object itself&mdash;which includes buildings and projects, texts and discourses, and the contexts of their production and reception. It also involves questioning the ways in which architecture spatializes technologies of extraction, means of production, and systems of power and domination.&nbsp;</p><p>Specific features of the object&mdash;colonialism and the violence it enacts on lands and peoples; global capital markets and the rise of nationalism; lingering regimes of inequality; aspirations to universality and the entrenchment of local interests; in general, the contradictory conditions of the modern world&mdash;marked a fundamental change in the way its history could be conceived. By the turn of the twentieth century, the ideal of the universal subject of the European Enlightenment had been irrevocably fractured and contested as a fiction of empire. Similarly, former parameters outlining &ldquo;proper&rdquo; forms of art and architecture have been revealed as Eurocentric constructions that conceal the multiplicity of architectural production. Rather than constructing a singular historical narrative able to contain and make sense of these contradictions, this course traces multiple modernisms that arise to respond, enforce, or contest these regimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This course will use theoretical texts and historical examples to generate ways of thinking about modern architecture not as a bygone era but as the inaugural frame for our own situation. Our question is not &ldquo;How does modern architecture reflect the given conditions of modernity?&rdquo; but rather, &ldquo;How can architecture (as subject, as object, as technique) produce, impose, or resist those very conditions?&rsquo;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the lectures, all students are required to attend a weekly one-hour discussion section.

It forms the core of natural-world reverence, maybe worship, the religion of the green future.

It is a genre, a haphazard collection, a force as amorphous as blowing leaves, a western-European device born about 1900 and now global, but always quasi-imperialist, always of the north. It scares public-school teachers who loathe Hogwarts, the Old Religion, the never-ending ancient tradition so deeply rooted in the European cultural past that it shapes contemporary propriety. Holly and other evergreens bedeck churches at Christmas, but not mistletoe, the evergreen that killed the Norse sun god, Balder, the sky-tree Druids brought west from the Danube and grafted onto oaks, the Yule sovereign that permits kisses forbidden at all other seasons, part of the merry (not happy) in Christmas. Quality fantasy teaches that every tree species once had individual character (willows walk, sometimes assault: the Whomping Willow behaves naturally) and that the most powerful (mistletoe included) once named the letters of the alphabet, that the year had thirteen lunar months marking the earth-mother menstrual cycle, that the seasons proved weird to those in the know, witches especially. Out of the great northern arc from Finland to Ireland (stabbed by the westward-moving Celts and the Albion wraiths) originates quality contemporary fantasy, much of it written by British writers schooled in Latin from childhood.&nbsp; It comprises a grimoire of irresistible power. As climate change melts Arctic ice and opens new sea lanes, as Canada hurriedly builds a large navy, the north becomes more important politically, economically, and militarily - but its emerging conceptual importance orders this course this term. Cold, discomfort, swimming in the winter ocean, trusting to quality attire, knives, and open boats, seeing sideways in the winter dark, finding what one must find in the arboreal forests, all fuses into the meaning of north.

The House of White by Shinohara achieves an almost oceanic spaciousness through abstraction and precision. The course will be structured as a series of discursive narratives and debates, such as tradition, transparency, lightness, and technology, which defined architectural practice and criticism in Japan after 1945. Major figures, notably It\u014d Toyoo, successfully overcame these differences and established new paradigms.

Repair and renewal are therefore fundamental components of contemporary practice increasingly requiring facility in techniques of conservation planning and execution, rehabilitation and adaptive reuse.</p><p>Designed to ground the participant in the methodologies of conservation and renewal and to introduce the tools necessary to successfully approach working with existing buildings in established precincts, the course will include lectures by the instructor and guest experts, and in-class discussions from readings. While interventions must include sound technical solutions, any modification from conservation to renovation and additions must address the full complement of values necessary to enable an economically viable, socio-culturally relevant rehabilitation. We will examine a range of conservation and intervention case studies at the building and urban scale for both traditional and modern structures and sites &ndash; including a mini-module on the impending renovations to Gund Hall.</p><p>We will look critically at how the international Charters and Standards employed in working with historic fabric impact our approach to modifications to any existing building or site from a technical, design and regulatory standpoint, and will particularly address the question as to how the apparatus of conservation is changing to best serve both underrepresented constituencies and the legacy of modernism and the recent past.</p><p>The course is a lecture course, with a class discussion component. Evaluation will be based upon participation in readings and themed discussion, submission of a short analytical mid-term paper, and a choice of final project: either 1., an assessment and intervention design exercise on an undeveloped modest property, or 2., an analytical case study of the rehabilitation and transformation of a significant property &ndash; either of the student&rsquo;s choosing.</p><p>The course is open to all interested GSD students.</p>"

By &ldquo;lens&rdquo; we can think immediately about optical instruments that bring the world into view, from the first microscopes that revealed legions of minute beasties and beauties, to scanning electron microscopes, which create their own phantasms of visual mastery. What makes this materiality of vision so inviting is that intrinsic to the craft, practice, and indeed the science of natural history are the techniques of observing, representing, writing, drawing, modeling, collecting, sorting, naming, and knowing that are consistent with our own work as architects and landscape architects. The natural history tradition&mdash;which at one point in its own history shifted from a descriptive to a historical art&mdash;long promoted the notion of the kingdoms of nature: mineral, vegetable, animal. Living amidst their ruins, we will attend to the ways in which the social, political, and especially economic (i.e. ecological) ideas and ideals that supported these kingdoms fell apart, producing far more curious and complicated affiliations and entanglements.

This seminar course will explore the intersections of architecture and property, with a particular attention to how they come together in law. Not only will we ask who wields properties&rsquo; power, and to what end? But also how is that power put into play, what tools (however banal) are necessary to enact it, and how can it be resisted or practiced differently?</p><p>The semester is structured in two parts. In the first four sessions, we will explore major themes in contemporary property theory, with special attention to how these themes relate (however loosely) to architectural form. In the second half of the semester, these themes will be expanded through specific topics that allow a deep dive into the relationship between law and architecture. Each week a legal case is paired with secondary texts that help contextualize that week&rsquo;s topic. We will spend class time unpacking the legal case together, with the aim of understanding how architectural knowledge, either implicitly or explicitly, is at play in the construction of its arguments. The legal cases here are chosen with specific attention to the ways in which they conjure up questions about the relationship between architectural form and social form. Some are landmark decisions (Lawrence v. Texas), some are very much not (Stambovsky v. Ackley).

In this plant exploration, a crucial role is also given to the common name of a plant that often assumes a cultural and ritual meaning instead of a purely botanical one. This type of nomenclature also builds connections between spiritual value and the designed landscape. This collection aims to have an impact in the design fields: in the past, plant palettes were chosen for visual beauty or screening, then more recently, plants also started to be selected for their ecological value.

Such lands hold contested narratives and histories, from places of deep meaning to that of quick extraction, from sites of enslaved labor to mining operations, from reservations to internment camps, from places of violence to those of resistance, among others. We will interrogate place theories in the context of land/place-based sources, methods, and tools (including archives, walking, drawing, thick sections, texts, maps, oral histories, poetry, song,...) for identifying, revealing, interpreting, and sharing narratives that may collide or upturn, and deny or erase one another. Drawing from a selection of places in the United States including the Harvard campus, the seminar will focus on how narratives of identity, race, gender, and indigenous sovereignty have shaped place; the approaches designers might employ when taking on the responsibility of design and making; and the approaches from which historians might draw in curating and curating histories of place.</p><p>We frame this seminar as a series of discussions, grounded in an inquiry into ways of knowing and critical place-based studies as a foundation for building alternative bodies of knowledge. Our readings will engage with studies of the social constructions of identity, race, and gender as embedded in and emanating from land and place, and in particular through the practice of designing landscape. We will build on the scholarship of Omi and Winant&rsquo;s work on racial formation and theories of intersectionality for while race is a &ldquo;master category&rdquo; &ldquo;it is not possible to understand the (il)logic of any form of social stratification, any practice of cultural marginalization, or any type of inequality or human variation, without appreciating the deep, complex, comingling, interpenetration of race, class, gender, and sexuality.&rdquo; (Michael Omi, and Howard Winant. Racial Formation in the United States. Routledge, 2015.: 106) Our work will also draw from George Lipsitz&rsquo;s essay on the racialization of space and spatialization of race to consider how counter narratives might reveal alternative histories. As we extend our discussion, we will explore the theories of intersectionality with careful readings of selected writings of Saidiya Hartman, Katherine McKittrick, Tiffany Lethabo King, Andrea Roberts, Anna Tamura, and a richness of other authors, thinkers, and scholars of land, landscape, and place, each of who has shared approaches to re-reading and revealing counter narratives of people and place.</p><p>Our purpose will be to critically consider how we might engage with history to question how we have come to frame and define practices of place-making including landscape architecture, and in turn, how might re-imagine potential futures.</p><p>While there exists a deep body of knowledge and scholarship, there is much more to do; there remains critical narratives yet to be shared in our collective learning. To build alternative narratives, we will center how communities have made place in their own ways, rather than focusing on the oppression and the violence of neglect. We will focus on resistance as evident for example in the practice of landscape and garden design and land property rights and food sovereignty. As a means to move forward we will investigate practices of preservation, labor, and environmental justice to identify how this work might amplify counter narratives of potential futures in landscape studies.</p><p>By revising our understanding of history and historiographies of landscape architecture as a constellation of practices that describe a profession and a discipline, we open the door to a richer and more complex future for designers, and even more importantly, for our communities.</p>"

This is particularly true in the evolving field of Urban Conservation, where conserving and enhancing use values in the broadest sense from the level of the building, street and landscape to the district and city, are critical determinants of future success.</p><p>Focus on creative thinking is therefore necessary to accommodate both the volume and often erratic quality of the resources under consideration, but more profoundly to acknowledge that science and scholarship address only some of the full range of values and issues that must be considered to ensure the success of any intervention. While this approach does not circumvent the normal processes of assessment and evaluation of physical resources &ndash; both buildings, and sites, it does recognize the essential need for a deeper understanding of the social and economic factors that help define place. Subsequently, we may then apply critical overlays to identify possibilities for syntheses that balance repair and conservation with appropriate future use, perception, and socio-economic value.</p><p>Case Studies in Urban Conservation will build upon the philosophical and practical underpinnings of the fall semester Building and Urban Conservation course (not a prerequisite) and will explore the range of scales from building and landscape to campus and neighborhood or district. The curriculum will be anchored by lectures that survey contemporary and historic theories of urban conservation followed by a series of Case Studies looking at interventions into a variety of traditional and modern places given by the instructor and an international roster of guest practitioners and scholars, who, will address current theoretical, political, and practical issues facing the renewal of the built environment.</p><p>Readings will be assigned weekly and serve as the basis for regular in-class student-led discussion, and there will be a short, written mid-term exercise.&nbsp; Class participation is an important pedagogical component as we will be exploring ideas, concepts and a range of possible outcomes to different kinds of interventions at different building and site scales. The final project will be an analytical case study of the student&rsquo;s choosing of an example of a completed or ongoing urban conservation project, or alternatively, to define a project for a potential site that could benefit from the application of conservation methodology to the revitalization of an urban complex, neighborhood, or district to better accommodate contemporary use while sustaining its essential character. &nbsp;</p><p>The course is open to all GSD students and is geared to anyone in any discipline who is interested in the role of conservation &ndash; as both a practical and theoretical tool &ndash; in helping to understand, sustain and enhance the existing built environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>We set the stage by means of a persistent dilemma shaping aesthetic practices as it was inaugurated by concepts from Kant and Hegel: Is architecture an autonomous form or is it determined by its historical, social, and technological contexts? The version of the dilemma we will treat here began in the West in the 1960s, when architects and scholars explicitly reframed the above question and continued their pondering at least until the 1990s. The concept of postmodernism, often a corollary of structuralist and poststructuralist thought, finds its definitive articulation in architecture. Postmodern architecture was born in the academy and was developed in journals that interacted with poststructuralism. In the course, we will follow that development with close readings of architectural projects and theoretical texts. Meanwhile, the larger currents of postmodern thought flowed through poststructuralist theories of subject formation, which we will also study.</p><p>The embrace of poststructuralist theory eventually precipitated the end of historicist postmodernism, though it is arguable that extensions of postmodern thought continue to frame recent architectural production. In the second half of the seminar, we will investigate the lineage of poststructuralism in architectural practice since 1990. This part of the course will be more speculative and will require intense involvement on the part of participants.</p><p>Prerequisites: BTC or equivalent study in architecture theory and history.</p>"

The course situates the picturesque within the empiricist tradition of Edmund Burke and Adam Smith before tracing its expression in the built environment, with the goal of reading European encounters with colonial landscapes back into histories of modern architecture and urban planning. We will pair writings on the eighteenth-century landscape garden (William Gilpin, Uvedale Price), nineteenth century vernacular revivalism and medievalism (John Ruskin, Camillo Sitte), and twentieth century Townscape (Nikolaus Pevsner, Reyner Banham) with examinations of the circulation of ideas, forms, artifacts, and architects across colonial space. We will also pay close attention to the embodied nature of the picturesque and its gendered and raced dimensions, as well as the potential of digital tools to redefine traditional picturesque methodologies. The final third of the course will examine the possibilities the picturesque offers for contemporary practice, reflecting on design approaches to climate change, urban informality, and urban regeneration and place-making.</p><p>Students will be evaluated on class discussion and short writing assignments, and will submit a final paper alongside a design project.</p><p>This is an advanced history elective open to students across GSD degree programs.

Readings address the art and architecture production of those excluded from these canons. We will also problematize notions of agency and authorship in cultural production.</p><p>Each week we will focus on a type of space central to the formation of modernity, which we discuss through close attention to objects and sites from different historical times and geographical locations. The first half of the semester focuses on notions of otherness from broad transnational processes to the space of the body. We discuss the colonization of the Americas as a process of violence, resource extraction and exchanges that led to the construction of multiple modernities. We trace networks of colonial trade and the spaces they engendered, including the plantation, the quilombo, and the underground railroad. We explore the kitchen as a site of both community and labor, and the closet as a metaphorical space for the construction of gender identity. On the second half of the semester, we turn to institutional spaces such as schools, prisons, and museums. We supplement canonical analysis of these spaces with discussions on the prison industrial complex, the university as a settler colonial institution, and architecture&rsquo;s own exhibitionary complex.</p><p>The use of a core spatial construct as the base of each weekly theme enables the course to range broadly across time and space while also offering students concrete, in-depth knowledge of specific objects and sites.

What responsibility do they have, and what roles should they play, in working with others to clarify what is to be negotiated, and how the negotiation process should proceed? More concretely, what does it take to be an effective negotiator? And beyond negotiation, when and how can planners facilitate multi-stakeholder consensus on planning decisions?</p><p>This module is designed to introduce questions for the planner as negotiator, and to build students&rsquo; skills in negotiation, facilitation, and consensus building. It draws on principles and insights from interest-based and social-psychological approaches to negotiation.

At a broad scale, the climate crisis is transforming the built and natural environment surrounding us&mdash;putting frontline communities at risk of warming, expanding oceans, inland flooding, and pollution, scorching our cities and open spaces, destroying the foundation of global biodiversity, threatening agricultural production, and entirely reconstituting what it means to design for places in the midst of profound and uncertain change. At the same time, shifting market forces, supply chain crises, technological advancements, diversifying client pools, and evolving societal attitudes toward open space are reshaping practice as we know it, rapidly expanding the reach and scope of design services while grappling to value them appropriately.<br />&nbsp;<br />The ground has shifted beneath us, and the way we have practiced landscape architecture for the last century is no longer applicable. Our context requires a new approach, affecting both the work of design and the structure of the business itself. For too long, self-regard and siloed competition across the design fields have prevented us from looking elsewhere for inspiration&mdash;but today, emerging professionals and leaders alike have much to learn from the business models, operational structures, and management structures of firms in creative industries, technology, manufacturing, and beyond.<br />&nbsp;<br />The central premise of this course: to prepare students for a changing market, we will honestly examine the current state at play in the design industry, analyzing a wide cross-section of firm typologies and scales, while also looking beyond the field for inspiration. We will investigate these ideas through detailed case studies, guest lectures, workshops, discussions, assignments, and student-led research.<br />&nbsp;<br />The course is divided into two sections (1) Contemporary Landscape Architecture Practice Today and (2) Looking Outside the Field. The first examines methods and structures for practicing landscape architecture today and the second looks outside the field. Students will use the ideas shared during the two modules to imagine alternative frameworks for practice. Throughout the semester, students will be asked to consider both the broader forces affecting design today and real, actionable ways to meet these challenges through practice, culminating in a final project that will be shared and presented to the class for discussion.<br />&nbsp;<br />In-class participation is essential for this seminar.

In so doing, the course expands critical awareness of the forces that have shaped contemporary architectural practice, and it invites speculation about alternative forms and formats of practice that are even now emerging.</p><p>The course will first review the framework of world traditions that have contributed to the formation of &ldquo;the architect&rdquo; as both symbol and individual personification, a mediator within the cultural imagination between social vision and technical know-how. Competing and complementary ideas of the architect emerged, historically, from both the top-down authority of owners and the bottom-up craft abilities of builders, and then merged in the middle with the architect as intermediary agent between the other parties&rsquo; respective ends and means.</p><p>The perspective of the course will then shift to the context of North America to consider the specific formation of the U.S architectural profession. European colonial assumptions were gradually supplanted by affordances of a nascent American democracy to yield, by the middle of the 19th century, a particular vocational manifestation of a rising professional ideology. The architecture profession that unfolded between the end of the Civil War and the aftermath of World War II institutionalized new models of corporate identity as well as mechanisms of social closure and market control &ndash; through professional organization and university education; through state regulation, examination, and licensure. As a result, the definition of the architect was significantly narrowed as compared to the foregoing, laissez faire model of unregulated titular claims.</p><p>Two extended case studies focus upon the material culture of American architectural practice &ndash; its tools, documents, methods, divisions of labor &ndash; as a means of unearthing the embedded ideological assumptions of the profession. Critical consideration of The Handbook of Architectural Practice (1920) illustrates how specific tools and assumptions of U.S. architectural practice evolved and functioned as mediators between and among clients, architects, and builders. Likewise, a social history of Ramsey &amp; Sleeper&rsquo;s Architectural Graphic Standards (1932) examines the profession from the bottom-up, from the standpoint of the architectural drafter, to provide insight into ongoing dynamics roiling the ranks of architectural labor. Together, these case studies demonstrate ways in which the standardization of the architecture profession both issued from and advanced processes of standards formation in American society at-large.</p><p>Finally, in consideration of the constant revolutionizing of architectural practice that the historical record shows, we will conclude the course by speculating about emergent trajectories of architectural practice in light of changing tools and technologies and shifting matters of concern.</p><p>The course will be conducted through dialog during each weekly session. A topical focus upon commonly assigned texts will be contextualized by framing lectures and then elaborated by student-led responses and discussions.</p>"

Ecology is the science that aims to understand how all these relationships work and how they change through space and time. Landscape design can incorporate many of those relationships to create spaces that go beyond human value-laden functions and design complex systems that are able to self-organize and respond to current global changes, with lasting impact for centuries.</p><p>Through lectures, discussions, readings, case studies, and design projects, the goal of this course is to understand the complexity of living systems to integrate it in landscape design. In particular, we will investigate the processes and functions that emerge from ecosystem structure to help you integrate these components in your future designs creating resilient and resistant landscapes. From small-scale projects where one or several processes or ecosystem components can be integrated at the core of urban areas or buildings, to large-scale projects aiming to design entire landscapes or manage large portions of land, you will learn how to use the power of life in design.</p><p>The centerpiece of this course will be the development of this ecological layer in the context of your Core Studio III project. We will reach this goal with the help of two key course components. Field trips to key ecosystems close to the Cambridge area (coastal areas and forests) that have being affected by human disturbance and protection. Six guest lecturers from outstanding firms and the academia will join us to share their views on how to integrate ecology in design and gain a deeper understanding of key ecological elements. We will explore the integration of all these elements in the practice of landscape architecture in a rapidly changing world with an uncertain future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>An Introduction to Woody Plants as a Design Medium (Matthew Girard):</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This portion of the course is for MLA AP students.</p><p>Recognizing that plants are one of the essential mediums of landscape architecture, this module seeks to introduce the student to the relationships between plants and people (horticulture) and the relationships between plants and the environment (ecology). The class focuses on the following topics and objectives:</p><p>- Concepts and practices necessary for using woody plants as a design medium.<br />- An introduction to the spatial, visual, functional, temporal, and sensorial qualities of woody plants in the landscape.<br />- An introduction to the horticultural requirements of woody plants particularly as it relates to the urban environment.<br />- Techniques and practices for using woody plants in the designed landscape.</p>"

For designers who shape the built environment, there is an urgent need to respond to the changing climate with greater understanding, sophistication, and imagination. To do so requires a community of learning committed to deeper analysis of the patterns of change and the potential roles designers may play in reducing carbon emissions and adapting to the many changes the future will bring. We must ask critical questions and interrogate existing systems of knowledge.&nbsp; What is climate change? How can designers approach it? What are the design strategies? How effective are they? Whom do they serve? And on what terms?</p><p>The effects and burdens of climatic change are unequal, contributing to increased social and economic disparity and often exacerbating historic patterns of inequity. The impacts are multiple and diverse as are the many cultures and communities that must respond and adapt. Therefore, a universal, one size fits all approach is not an adequate response. To develop design tools that respond to these conditions, we need to understand not only the science, but also the political, social, economic, and cultural contexts on the ground, where design projects and movements are rooted.</p><p>Through a series of lectures and case studies, this course will explore the range of paradigmatic design responses to the climate crisis. This foundation will be built through a series of talks by GSD faculty and external experts across a variety of fields. Lectures and panel discussions will cover both the science of and design response to the climate crisis including adaptation, mitigation, climate justice and activism. We will engage in discussion together and with these invited experts to advance our knowledge and interrogate existing practices. &nbsp;</p><p>Students will develop and analyze a case study, advancing methodologies for critical assessment and visual representation. The studies will consider social, cultural, and aesthetic dimensions as well as environmental function, economic deployment, and political engagement. These exemplary cases will be a means to understand and articulate the evolving role of landscape architecture and related disciplines in designing for an increasingly vulnerable planet. As such, the course will explore not only how landscape architects respond to the climate crisis, but what these actions say about the nature of design itself. The cases will be situated in different geographical and climatic contexts and the responses will be understood in relation to advances in science as well as the variations in political, environmental, economic, social, and historical context.</p><p>Climate by Design is a required course for MLA degree candidates and open to other GSD and Harvard students with an interest in the climate crisis and design.</p>"

We will explore the role of real-time, bidirectional communication between human and digital agents in a design context, and leverage the potentials of this interactive relationship to establish new creative domains.<br />&nbsp;<br />Digital interfaces provide computational frameworks for creative exploration in disciplines such as architecture, design and art. However, in many instances such as traditional computer-aided design (CAD) software, integrated development environments (IDE), numerically-controlled (CNC) fabrication machines, or certain kinds of robots and neural networks, the machine is subservient to the orders of its human counterpart. While this model might be a convenient human-machine relationship for production-oriented scenarios, in the case of design environments, a higher degree of machine agency could be desired, as it may generate new models of ideation, creative exploration and design through human-computer collaboration.<br />&nbsp;<br />Our investigation is inspired by the concept of Enactivism, a philosophy which argues that cognition arises from the interactions of an agent with its context. Rather than in an abstract or intangible way, knowledge and learning in agents arise from purposeful, situated and embodied interaction with their context. Translated to design environments, what would it mean to create with tools that have a certain degree of agency of their own? How would that inform and expand our creativity? What kind of opportunities may arise from designing as a conversation rather than an imposition? Can design be conceived as the human curation of the suggestions of an artificial intelligence? How can the power and precision of fabrication machines be amplified by the decision-making capacity of humans-on-the-loop? Are these new forms of collaborative art?<br />&nbsp;<br />We will address these questions, and many others, through the design of concurrent human-machine interactive platforms, with a particular focus on the computational aspects of the system.

Structured by the typologies of manufacturing processes - including subtractive, additive, molding, assembly processes, and beyond - this course will explore the materialization of design as both a technical and a creative endeavor. Special attention will be given to the interplay between digital information and physical artifacts, and the opportunities and shortcomings of those translations. Through lectures, hands-on workshops, and a series of making-centric assignments, students will engage with a range of methods and materials that underpin digital fabrication. In addition to a deep connection with the context of digital making, the course is designed to provide hands-on experience with the digital fabrication equipment&ndash;including CNC mills, 3D printers, and industrial robotic arms&ndash;located in the GSD Fabrication Lab and is suited for novices and experts alike.</p>"

For instance, most prevailing paradigms in CAD modeling are based on the explicit definition of geometrical entities in model space (location and size of 2D shapes, vertices of a mesh, control points of NURBS objects) and their manipulation through constructive modeling operators (extrude, revolve, sweep or boolean operations, to name a few). However useful, such paradigms are often very limited for advanced creation/manipulation of digital models, such as those with high degrees of formal complexity (failed boolean intersections, complex infill patterns in 3D prints) or simply incapable of representing certain kinds of realities (models with non-binary gradients between inside and outside).</p><p>In parallel, the field of computer graphics has developed a plethora of techniques designed to generate, visualize and process images displayed on a 2D screen. Many of these methods involve the implicit definition of the rules governing visualization pipelines, expressed as functional representations of the characteristic values in a field of discrete entities. Traditionally, this has translated into the problem of computing the RGB values of each pixel in a digital screen. However, modern applications of these techniques have been extended in multiple dimensions to, for example, generate procedural animated graphics, analyze and process video, perform computational fluid dynamics, voxel-based world generation for video games, or multi-material 3D printing.</p><p>In this course, you will learn techniques for the procedural generation of discrete multidimensional spaces, such as 2D images, video, voxelized fields or any extension thereof.

        "course_description": "<p>As a scarce and necessary resource, land triggers competition and conflict over its possession and use. For privately owned land, the market manages much of the competition through its familiar allocative price-setting framework. However, because one person&rsquo;s use of land affects individual and collective interests of others and market mechanisms alone do not always protect or promote such interests, laws enacted by legislative bodies, administered by government agencies, and reviewed by courts have arisen to fill the gap.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Encompassed in local ordinances, higher-level legislation, administrative rules, discretionary government decisions, constitutions, and judicial opinions, land use laws and environmental laws significantly shape the built and natural environment. For example, zoning&rsquo;s use and density restrictions affect whether neighborhoods are demographically diverse or homogeneous, its height and setback restrictions sculpt the skyline. Environmental laws govern the extent to which land uses pollute air, water, and land, whether habitat is available for endangered species, and whether wetlands are preserved. Recently enacted laws are beginning to address the impacts of climate change, determining whether and how individuals may build or rebuild in areas vulnerable to floods, severe storms, forest fires, heat waves, and droughts.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Through lectures, discussions, readings, and a written exercise, this course provides students with a working knowledge of land use laws and environmental laws, the institutions that create, implement, and review them, and the issues that swirl around them. The course distinguishes law&rsquo;s method from those employed by other disciplines and fields. The role of non-lawyers, including urban planners, designers, public policymakers, developers, and community activists in influencing, drafting, and implementing land use and environmental laws, is explored.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />No prior legal background is assumed. Students with a legal background have found the course instructive. For pedagogical reasons, laws employed in the United States will be the main references, but comparisons with laws in other countries will be regularly made. Reading assignments are drawn from primary sources (legislation, constitutions, judicial opinions) and secondary sources (law review and journal articles, book excerpts, professional reports). A written exercise asks students to critically examine one provision of a zoning law and draft its replacement. An oral final exam will test overall fluency with the course subject matter.</p>"

A major theme of the course is that consequences of previous policy and planning interventions have had lasting effects.&nbsp; These are reflected today in continued residential segregation by race and income, the persistence of barriers to affordable and healthy housing, and gaps in homeownership rates and housing wealth by race and ethnicity. The theme of structural racism as shaping access to housing over US history will be examined at some length.</p><p>The course first lays out a framework for understanding the roles housing plays in individuals&rsquo; lives, neighborhoods, and the metropolis. Class sessions examine the unique attributes and roles of housing, including the role of homes as constitutive of the private and domestic realms, housing as an icon and encoder of social status, and housing as a commodity. This section of the course also explores housing as a driver of urbanization and shaper of neighborhoods, as well as theories of neighborhood change.</p><p>The next four sessions of the course focus on government interventions into housing in the United States from the beginning of urbanization up to the 1960s. Classes cover early efforts to eradicate slums and improve housing for the poor; systematic efforts to enforce segregation by race in the early 20th century including the practice of redlining; federal involvement in homeownership and suburbanization, ; the policy motivations and design of early public housing and urban renewal programs; and local interventions to regulate the development of housing and access to it, particularly in suburbs.</p><p>The third section of the course focuses on a second wave of interventions arising in the 1960s in response to unanticipated consequences of earlier interventions, including public housing and urban renewal, as well as responses to demographic and economic shifts and the Civil Rights and citizen participation movements.

The class will argue for the necessity of studying theories of justice, inequality, and structural violence along with climate science, policy, and international diplomacy. In our search for climate justice, the class will trace various forms of climate activism within the history of environmental movements, explore non-Western forms of knowledge as key critiques and logics of action, and evaluate concrete suggestions for radical reform. We will discuss how climate justice as a framework of concern is both universal and specific, and we will critically engage ideas of justice at different scales, from the local to the global, with careful attention to context. We will ultimately ask what new kinds of practices, knowledges, and collaborations are necessary to build more just and responsible relationships between people and the nonhuman world, and with each other.</p>"

Cases draw from an international survey with emphasis on Europe, North America, and East Asia, although also including examples from the Americas, South and Southeast Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and Oceania. The course introduces approximately 240 cases along with frameworks for organizing and thinking with this corpus.<br />&nbsp;<br />We begin with two broad surveys of concepts germane to the discussion and design of contemporary housing, including 1) ideas of community and what constitutes a neighborhood across historical contexts and cultural milieu, and 2) territories, types, interiors, and other landscapes dealing with the constraints and dimensions of the external context and internal life. These are followed by cases, organized by key characteristics of the building or external context they engage. In each, contemporary examples provide the primary focus, while precedents within and adjacent to architecture are introduced to contextualize historical circumstances and trace the evolution of ideas. In Spring 2024, the categories include: 1) urban block shapers, 2) superblock configurations, 3) tall towers, 4) big buildings, 5) mat buildings, 6) housing and landscapes, 7) infrastructural engagements, 8) infill and puntal interventions, 9) housing special populations, and 10) temporary and incremental housing.<br />&nbsp;<br />Each class is organized around a i) lecture, ii) student presentation, and iii) discussion.

Part historical dive, part technical workshop, the class moves between investigations into the historical development of cities through image and instruction on the fundamental two and three-dimensional representational techniques involved in visualizing the vast array of inevitably convoluted and undetermined aspects of urbanity. The class will review how the city&#39;s evolution has been represented over time in urban design, landscape architecture, architecture, art, politics, and culture while developing new techniques and methods for representing latent urban conditions and uncertain futures.</p><p>Structured around participatory lectures, discussions, and creative exercises, the course necessitates students&#39; abilities to consume, interpret, and produce. The majority of the work for the course goes towards developing a series of exercises that visualize a chosen urban condition at a series of scales and correlated perspectives. These exercises break down the process of image conception and execution over several weeks. Each scale builds on top of the previous and forms a composite image of a particular city when assembled. The final assignment will be curating the work produced to form a visual atlas through a whole class exhibition.</p><p>Designers with a robust representational repertoire will be those best suited to communicate their ideas and impact change in the coming generation.

Students will create impactful visual content structured by meaning, beauty, and emotion. They will develop an eye for strong images and understand how individual details such as composition, tone, texture, and light strengthen the larger picture. A student who successfully engages with the course content will emerge with the conceptual and technical capacity to create compelling images that challenge the conventions of representation while also speaking to a broad audience. Simultaneously, by representing cities at various scales, students will come away with the ability to read various urban conditions and engage directly with contemporary pluralistic urbanism.</p><p>The course is for designers of all types.

Students must define their social responsibility and will directly confront social frameworks to explore avenues for reparative urban design.</p><p>Throughout the course, we will review historical design injustices and unveil the benefit of healing, trauma-informed, and community-driven alternatives. Our focus will center on two primary vulnerable populations: system-impacted communities and the unhoused. Marginalized and criminalized by society, these communities have been further failed by designers who concretize these value judgements spatially. To challenge implicit bias that compounds across the built environment, students will utilize numerous qualitative and quantitative research methods, alongside design-thinking to produce empathetic, data-driven solutions.<br />&nbsp;<br />We will learn and deploy various community engagement practices, such as interviews, surveys, focus groups, intercepts, and online engagement tools. In light of the course&rsquo;s sensitive topics, there will be special attention to cultural competency and best practices specific to vulnerable populations. Students will be evaluated on projects that incorporate design, policy, and financing that advocate for these communities, for justice, and that aim to repair past harms and improve outcomes well into the future.<br />&nbsp;<br />Interdisciplinarity is strongly encouraged.

While reducing emissions, or mitigation, remains as important as ever, adaptation, or finding ways for people and cities to live with climate impacts, is now imperative. This seminar on urban adaptation is comprised of two complementary parts: 1. It will provide students a foundation in the field through readings and discussion of major topics and 2. It will provide students the opportunity to engage with an urgent emerging problem in adaptation and deliver planning guidance to a real-world client. As climate impacts become more pervasive, climate anxiety, or well-founded unease about the future has also become rampant. As a point of departure, the course will begin with works from the arts and humanities on hope and envisioning positive future alternatives. This will provide a grounding to delve into topics including equity and justice, regional collaboration, migration, limits to adaptation, the adaptation/mitigation nexus, and transformational adaptation. Students will put these concepts into practice through a project for the Climigration Network exploring, analyzing, and proposing models for shared governance between learned and lived experts and for directing resources to frontline communities. Shared governance is a growing approach to practice among institutions and organizations committed to pursuing transformational adaptation. Through the two complementary parts of the course, students will have an opportunity to be at the cutting-edge of practice while engaging thoughtfully with the full complexity of underlying adaptation challenges.</p>"

Why do some cities grow faster than others? Can cities ever get too dense or large? We will draw from typical urban economic models and frameworks but will also discuss and test their limits when applying them to complex urban systems. For example, how well do these models address issues of segregation and informality in cities? The course will draw from research and scholarship in the field of urban economics, as well as actual cases, policy applications and guest lecturers employing these concepts in the field.</p><p>The course also explores urban economics and market analysis as they intersect with real estate practice.&nbsp; Students learn, in a hands-on way, how to employ urban economics concepts and frameworks, including location theory, the interaction between local and global spatial dynamics, demographic trends, and regional economic forecasting, for data-driven market analyses useful for real estate and urban development practice more broadly. Students who take this class will be able to use economic frameworks and methods to design, evaluate and implement planning and policy interventions as well as understand the role of real estate markets in a range of urban settings.

A significant consequence of this crisis is migration, as individuals and communities are forced to relocate. Over the next 30 years, extreme climate zones and uninhabitable areas are projected to expand from 1% to 20% of Earth&#39;s land, leading to the displacement of hundreds of millions of people.<br />In this context, vulnerable regions and communities, historically the least responsible for this crisis, will be disproportionately affected.<br />&nbsp;<br />According to United Nations agencies&#39; data, while conflict remains the primary driver of displacement, there is a noticeable increase in climate- and disaster-related displacement. In 2022, disaster-related internal displacement accounted for more than half of all new displacements. Climate change, which is contributing to more frequent and severe extreme weather events, is increasingly recognized as one of the causes driving both instability and internal displacement. Between 31 million and 72 million people across sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America are expected to be displaced by 2050 due to water stress, rising sea levels, and crop failure. Scarcity and degradation of natural resources, limited access to sustainable livelihoods and basic services, are already creating tensions between host communities and internally displaced persons in numerous contexts.<br />&nbsp;<br />To address this pressing issue, the class will be conducted in conversation and coordination with the United Nations Secretary-General Peacebuilding Fund, which has extensive experience addressing challenges at the nexus of climate change, migration, peace, security, and development. Building upon their insights and in dialogue with UN Country Teams, local NGOs, and community representatives, we will examine climate migration through selected case studies within climate hotspots in the Sahel, Haiti, and the Pacific Islands while focusing on 1) cross-border migration, 2) rural-to-urban migration, 3) migration within island settings. We will explore holistic views of displacement and risk overlaps, including where conflict and climate change effects intersect.<br />&nbsp;<br />This project-based seminar aims to introduce a spatial design dimension to the nexus of climate migration, peace, security, and development. The goal is to develop informed strategies and innovative approaches that address the complex challenges of climate-induced migration in these vulnerable regions through design. The sessions will include meetings with experts to explore various topics, such as climate impacts in the selected areas, intersections with challenges like war, colonialism, and resource extraction, migration policies, climate-induced conflicts, water issues, blue lines, wetlands, sedentary and pastoralist habitation, complexity of climate models and theory, adaptation pathways, planning under deep uncertainty, and how spatial design can contribute to envisioning alternative futures.<br />&nbsp;<br />By leveraging design thinking and spatial analysis, students will be tasked to develop initial recommendations for building local and regional resilience in the short, mid, and long term within selected climate hotspots. These recommendations aim to pragmatically enhance the livelihoods of forcibly displaced persons and host communities at local and regional levels, while fostering more visionary imaginaries of a changing planet.</p>"

In the studios, the hands-on experience of design is a synthetic act, bringing together theory, technique, and aesthetic sensibility in the making of a landscape. In this studio, you will apply the skills and knowledge acquired through other first-year courses&mdash;Histories of Landscape Architecture, Landscape Representation, and Ecologies, Techniques, Technologies&mdash;to the conceptualization and design of landscapes. Upon successfully completing this studio you will have laid the foundation on which the rest of your study at the GSD will stand.</p><p>The central topic of this semester&rsquo;s studio is landscapes in the public realm: how is the public defined? Who defines it? What is a public landscape? How do we recognize it? How is it different from private ones? What and who do they represent, and how are they funded?</p><p>These questions will be explored through three themes that build upon one another&mdash; material culture, spaces for free assembly, and spaces for equity and health. As a discipline that deals with the transformation and the production of space, landscape architecture is in essence a materialist practice, whose outcome is made out of real, physical things. More specifically to landscape architecture, design entails the transformation of living systems, and require deep knowledge about materials, how they live, reproduce, die, their interactions with time and weather, and their origins and evolution.</p><p>While you learn to work with living materials, we will put emphasis on how the spatial configurations produced by landscape architecture can have significant consequences that transcend the purely physical: the landscapes we design enable and inhibit different forms of relationships between different entities. In urban contexts, people and their rights as citizens&mdash;and as human beings&ndash; constitute the central subject and object of those interactions. Within urban landscapes, it is the public space, more specifically, what constitutes the fundamental domain in the provision and protection of democracy, for it is in the public space where the most profound manifestations of social conflict, individual self-expression, and cultural exchange take place.</p><p>Thus, this studio explores two types of public space commonly found in the American city, the public square&mdash;City Hall Plaza in Boston&mdash;and the riverfront park&ndash;the right bank of the Charles River in Allston&mdash;and the physical and political implications in their transformation. Through these two different sites, we will investigate public space as representation of our shared conditions of existence, as expression of difference, values, individuality, universality, knowledge, and power, and we will study how the changes we introduce in the received configuration of the public imply, inevitably, the affirmation, the manipulation, and the suppression of some of those conditions.</p><p>While the landscapes we design are nested within larger landscapes and urban systems that are determined by broad and intricate networks of social and economic processes, in this studio we will focus on how the specific forms of discreet sites might constitute in themselves powerful tools in the transformation of those larger processes. Thus, although this studio starts with a rather small site (a site-less enclosed space) and ends with a presumably large one (a portion of the Charles River in Allston), we will not be bound by the simplistic idea that a larger site is necessarily more &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; as a design process, or that each is typologically bound to a predetermined historical format. Rather, we will focus on all the scales embedded in any landscape, finding the minute in the large, and the expansive in the small.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

These issues are extensively shifting the ways we live, and, at the very least, are the uninvited corollary through which we might imagine new expressions of the cemetery.</p><p>As sites of remembrance, cemeteries may be considered as &lsquo;places where memory crystalises and secretes itself as part of an ongoing construction of history&rsquo; (Pierre Nora 1989), whilst simultaneously acting as &lsquo;settings in which memory is a real part of everyday experience&rsquo; (Michael Rothberg 2010). They are spaces that are socially produced and made productive in social practice (Lefebvre 1974), whilst also being highly logistical practical settings created in the absent presence of the body (Ken Warpole).</p><p>Just as death is a necessary part of life, cemeteries are sites of contrast, yet it is perhaps through the very preservation of this tension of contradiction that they exist as some of the most enduring landscapes across cultures around the world.</p><p>Often perceived as a space &lsquo;apart&rsquo; from the city as a consequence of their physical traits and phenomenal characteristics, cemeteries none the less play significant roles within the life of the metropolis as biodiversity hotspots offering ecosystem services in the form of thermal regulation, stormwater management, and carbon absorption. They provide significant social functions such as spaces for people to seek sanctuary, reflection and play, and healthy spaces for individuals to contemplate in the context of a natural landscape.</p><p>Cemeteries, capable and perhaps charged to carry multiple meanings, are paradoxical spaces described by Foucault (1967) as &lsquo;heterotopias&rsquo;, a no place that, nonetheless, is. The studio will be exploring what the urban and social significance of the cemetery of the future could be, and ask what are the forms and cultural expressions the urban cemetery might project? How might the articulation of the material and physical space reinterpret the temporal experience of the cemetery, and how might the increasingly rich cultural diversity of a progressive society be celebrated through ritual and mediated through disparate processes of burial and internment? How might the cemetery critique and address the extensive environmental and social issues that are before us by proposing alternative organisational patterns and expression, a place that celebrates diverse beliefs and rituals, and a space as an important contribution to the city&rsquo;s natural systems?</p>"

The COVID pandemic has highlighted the continuing challenge of infectious diseases even as non-communicable diseases and injuries remain major causes of death amenable to prevention through changes to the built environment. Finally, towns and cities exist to help people gain access to nearby resources such as jobs, services, and cultural opportunities. Changes in technologies have altered whether one needs to be mobile to have accessibility; whether these changes will further equity is an open question.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, the economic logic of &ldquo;fossil capital,&rdquo; as argued by Andreas Malm, coupled industrial power generated from fossil fuels with wage labor. The primary orientation of this coupling was economic growth. Fossil capital has led to rising temperatures, melting ice, and decreased biodiversity&mdash;and the uneven distribution of effects on human populations. In New England, the techno-ecological landscapes that once supported everyday life&mdash;e.g. productive fisheries, forests, and fields&mdash; have been transformed by the market orientation of fossil capital. Relocated overseas, fragmented by urbanization, or restructured by changing economies, the physical remnants of socially productive landscapes have been romanticized, miniaturized, and historicized.&nbsp;</p><p>During the early 20th century, through the New Deal, the profession of landscape architecture undertook a broad range of public projects. During the 1930s, landscape architects planned, designed, and executed work across federal agencies as diverse as the War Department, Tennessee Valley Authority, Federal Housing Administration, and the Department of the Interior, creating thousands of jobs for out-of-work Americans. A broader examination of the history of landscape and the New Deal reveals that among the celebrated public initiatives were also many projects of environmental absurdity, constructed through grueling manual labor, often by racially segregated work crews.&nbsp;</p><p>Amidst the 2020 economic crisis and calls for a Green New Deal, the discipline of landscape architecture has the potential to again create jobs&mdash;&ldquo;green jobs&rdquo;&mdash;in service of a decarbonized economy. But without compelling visions for the future, the discipline will be limited to projects of climate change resilience that stabilize contemporary ways of life. This is an understandable sentiment in turbulent times, but it also represents the most pernicious form of &ldquo;sustainability.&rdquo; A new paradigm for working landscapes requires new associations beyond recreation and ecological restoration. The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed outdoors many activities that were previously limited to interior spaces. However, due to the urgency of this health crisis, most of these facilities are purely functionalist and designed for short- to medium- term deployment. This studio will explore the design of landscapes that can be new environments for health care, education, housing, and research that are disentangled from singular market orientation and hybridized with regional needs for food, fibers, clean water, and waste management.&nbsp;</p><p>Design approaches will be grounded in the material media of the discipline&mdash;soils, vegetation, water dynamics&mdash;and their controlling infrastructures, physical and policy-based. The studio will explore: how productive sectors will migrate due to climate risk; what happens to the land left behind; and how these landscapes can support dignified spaces for work and self-determination. These design propositions may lead to new forms, scales, and cadences for work and habitation that may seem improbable under current systems of funding, fuels, and power.&nbsp;In the 21st century, the socially productive landscape reconsidered does not merely provide the stuff of everyday life closer to home.&nbsp;It demands a paradigm shift from landscapes that are discrete and transactional to those that foster a commonwealth of human and natural labor.</p>"

As a Landscape Architect your role in this urban climatic transition is fundamental. Core IV provides you with the tools and skills to translate the important values and actions embedded in this process, into individual design proposals that are specific and concrete for the City of Boston.</p><p>In the Spring of 2024 Core IV joins current efforts from the federal, municipal, and civil society to accomplish this needed task. Among others: President Biden&acute;s administration realignment with the Paris Agreement followed by his American Jobs Plan[1] and the Roadmap for Nature-Based Solutions[2] at the COP 27; the commitment to swift from fossil fuels at COP 28; Mayor Michelle Wu&rsquo;s Boston Green New Deal &amp; Just Recovery [3] synthesizing many of the Boston Climate Action [4] initiatives toward climate resilience and decarbonization; or EPA5 and the Mystic River Watershed Association to reduce pollution. The semester opens with an immersive pre-term symposium to learn first-hand from state, city officials, and NGOs on their multiple Boston plans, initiatives, and policies while experts share important precedents and critically assess the encounters. As an academic exercise, we will have the freedom to move beyond the &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; of present possibilities, to more desirable outcomes toward climatic resilience in the Near Future. While enhancing your imagination in the creative process of design, this might be precisely where our collaboration becomes more nurturing and catalyzing.</p><p>After the opening, the semester is structured around three ACTIONS: 01. analyzing; 02. spatializing; 03. projecting. Each ACTION combines expert lectures, readings, skill building workshops, and exercises that built sequentially and iteratively upon each other during the semester. In closing, students assembled their work for a Near Future Charlestown Presentation to continue the engaging conversation that was started at the opening symposium.</p>"

Regarding learning objectives, the studio introduces critical concepts, strategies and technical skills associated with thinking about Urban Design and allows speculation on a designer&rsquo;s spectrum of roles in shaping urban environments. More generally the studio aims to develop necessary literacies for architects and landscape architects to engage in the bridging practice of Urban Design and to understand questions related to urban environments and to produce compelling formal responses. Here a fundamental difference between Urban Design and Architecture and Planning is its concern for the &lsquo;thingness&rsquo; in a Heideggerian sense, of urban settlement, which transcends the single building complex and involves competing claims and other unreconciled constraints needing to be resolved through design. Typically, cities are often parts of larger networks of communities and ecologies with both overlapping and complementary roles. Urban growth and change now range over a wider landscape, offering both opportunities, constraints and outcomes located in peri-urban, peripheral, and central locations. Within the scope and content of the studio, consisting of two Urban Design problems, each subdivided into exercises, evaluative reviews and crits will be accomplished by a series of fourteen presentations across topics within the two problems. Structural racism and effects of the Anthropocene Era, along with concomitant institutional issues and biases will be engaged with each specific exercise but also more generally through adherence to social actions, environmental awareness, and a cosmopolitan outlook. More specifically, in the first problem and exercises dealing with South Boston, housing affordability and other forms of discrimination will be challenged and discussed, along with the matter of Climate Change and sea-level rise. Similarly, in peripheral developments like Westwood in the second problem, the matter of access as well as environmental suitability will be topics of consideration. Throughout a sequence of topical presentations will be provided in an asynchronous format on these and related topics, including brownfield site amelioration, sea-level rise, landscape ecology, storm-water management, urban justice, and various forms of spatial development. The other first-term required course for incoming Urban Designers, titled GSD 4496 Urban Desing Contexts and Operations, will also bear on many of these and related topics.</p>"

Why?<br />&nbsp;<br />We are living in an unpredictable and volatile era. A seemingly unending series of natural disasters and anachronistic wars affect our daily lives. The places we inhabit may be unstable or mobile&mdash;a trend that will accelerate in the future&mdash;and we are expected to quickly adapt to a changing environment.<br />&nbsp;<br />In this situation, we must question the traditional status of architecture as a stable occupant of real estate. Should we instead imagine ephemeral, temporary, or transient architectural artifacts? How could forms and techniques of building be adjusted flexibly and spontaneously to adapt to new situations? How do these tectonic strategies respond to the specificities of place? And can these architectural ideas be used to address pressing contemporary problems including housing instability, economic inequality, and climate change?<br />&nbsp;<br />This studio will address these questions through a hands-on project with a clear outcome: a Sleeping Space. Sleeping is an essential part of our daily lives. A safe and comfortable place to sleep is indispensable for everyone, especially people affected by disaster and instability. When we rest, we find solace from worldly troubles, and we are free to explore a less constrained imaginative realm. In this studio, we will use sleep as a starting point for tectonic experiments that result in a space or assembly that engages the body. Often, sleeping spaces are flat, quiet, covered, and separated from other functions. The outcome of this project will be based on goals created by the student. It could be a shelter, partition, or structure which can accommodate a person for a restful night.</p><p>Students will design and fabricate the space and assembly at full-scale to put into practice their own concepts. As the studio designs and builds, we will examine and experiment with materials considering the constraints of time, ease of assembly, and cost. Typical building materials will be re-examined in addition to waste materials and other atypical materials.<br />&nbsp;<br />Throughout the studio, we will discuss our methods of working, and how adaptable spaces and details can and should be used. At the same time, we will also work quickly and intuitively to reach a tangible conclusion. We will start with the conviction that something must be made, hence the theme of the studio: do-it-anyway.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>The studio will deal with the strategies for the transformation of a coveted but obsolete architectural type, the urban villa in the park, keeping its attractive features but adapting it to contemporary social, economic, and ecological conditions. We will analyze the ambitions that the traditional urban villa type embodies and dismember it into the features that fulfill these ambitions. Based on a critical assessment, we will produce a new set of ambitions and cast it into a program. We will investigate the transformations that have already been experimented with in the 20th and 21st centuries, especially in Rome, Milan, Zurich, and Berlin. Finally, every student will produce his or her own design proposal, not as an accomplished project, but as deliberately unfinished work focusing on selective main issues.<br />&nbsp;<br />The studio will be structured in six steps.</p><p>First step: anatomy of the urban villa in the park. Its main qualities: relation to park and nature, privacy, spaciousness, neutrality and flexibility, and representation. Average dimensions: 500 sqm, 2 floors plus roof floor. Historical examples of urban villas in their specific urban context that should evolve without being disrupted.<br />&nbsp;<br />Second step: pragmatic dissection of the urban villa, with the aim of developing a functional program for a contemporary specimen. Use: residential; exceptions are possible but must be justified with good arguments. Critical assessment of the function of the urban villa. What is contemporary in this way of living? Social aspects. Climatic aspects. Ecological aspects. Grouping and scale. Confrontation of old/new requirements. What should be kept? Spacious rooms, representation, and relationship with the park. What should change? Overall dimension, use of the rooms, representation, economy, ecology.<br />&nbsp;<br />Third step: conceptual dissection of the urban villa. A personal description of experiences and emotions in an ideal urban villa, structured under, among other things, entering the house, cooking, eating, and socializing, view, and physical relationship with nature. The narrative should focus on what are - subjectively, individually - considered the main emotional dimensions.</p><p>Fourth step: decision for a specific transformation of an obsolete type into a contemporary one, ranging from shrinking to the mutation into a multi-apartment complex. Other options are possible as long as the intense relationship with the park is maintained. The choice must be made on the grounds of the brief developed in the second and third steps.</p><p>Fifth step: research of references complying with aspects of the pragmatical program and the narratives, 20th and 21st century: Plans, elevations, photographs. Interpretation and justification. How do the references comply with the new brief, the experiences and emotions it requires? How do they not? How can they be used as conceptual construction material for a new project?</p><p>Sixth step: a new proposal for a contemporary urban villa as a consistent result of the first five steps, focusing on the conceptual issues and architectural features considered to be crucial. Collage representation techniques are encouraged. The projects are not expected to be complete, accomplished designs: rather, results of a methodic process of research and choices, fragmentary proposals with in-depth investigations of specific aspects.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>The social and political tumult of the 1960s prompted a resurgence of utopian architecture. Rising fuel prices, a growing dependence on technology and, in particular, the television, the international space race, and the Cold War unleased a variety of direct and indirect challenges to mainstream architecture with grand visions for alternative ways of living in a future with diminished resources, including Superstudio, Archigram, Haus Rucker Co., Global Tools, and others.&nbsp; And, over time, a variety of maverick figures such as Yona Friedman, Paolo Soleri and Simone Swan championed their own, at times even questionable, solutions to societal ills&mdash;from mobile architecture, to extreme density, and the economic and environmental benefits of building with adobe. The social and environmental problems of the 1960s have largely been exacerbated in the intervening five decades or more. Today, the threat of climate change is no longer a fringe issue, and the affordable housing crisis is worldwide. Can or, even, should recent scientific and technological advancements bring the visions of the 1960s avant-garde to life? Are more recent supposedly utopian projects like NEOM&rsquo;s The Line&rdquo; in Saudi Arabia or &ldquo;Telosa,&rdquo; an American billionaire&rsquo;s answer to creating a more equitable and sustainable city, realistic or even desirable solutions to the climate and housing crises?</p><p>This studio takes the extreme climate of Texas and in particular the desert of Presidio County where Simone Swan developed her rammed-earth prototypes as its site. From 1980 to 2020, the state experienced 273 weather and climate-related events resulting in substantial losses of life and property. At the same time, the prospect of remote work has enabled towns in Texas to offer cash incentives, attracting residents seeking affordable housing. By the 2040s, Texas is projected to surpass California in population due to economic diversification, a lower cost of living, and ample land for expansion. The state leads not only in oil and gas but also in renewable energy sources like wind and solar power.</p><p>The core question of the studio will be: How large scale can bio-based construction go? With what type of structures? With which materials? At what density? In which typologies? For what kind of program? Students will be asked to think critically about their own vision of a desert utopia and experimental megastructures (with all their inherent contradictions) and to explore the adaptability and scalability of emerging bio-based materials as the basis for their vision. Recognizing that a module studio is a focused architectural investigation rather than a full project design, the studio will operate as a kind of seminar with weekly guest lecturers on such topics as land art and material innovations. Using a range of representational and narratives strategies such as models and collages like those of the 1960s avant-garde as well as written statements and/or hypothetical guidebooks or catalogues that articulate each student&rsquo;s vision of utopia, the studio also explores of how architecture and storytelling co-exist in the creative process.</p>"

This response is indeed very architectural, but it is easily grabbed out of our hands by the fields of real estate, public policy, and finance.</p><p>A systemic approach would make us understand these people may not only be homeless because they lack a place to stay during cold nights. They may even have one but do not return to it because something (or someone) prevents them from doing so. This approach to the problem seems out of reach for architects, closer to the field of social workers.

Contemporary housing and multi-use developments are either architectural archipelagos or islands, each composed of differently shaped, styled and scaled buildings.</p><p>This profusion of difference is not the manifestation of a radical project of architectural autonomy as, for example, theorized by Manfredo Tafuri in his analysis of Piranesi&rsquo;s Campo Marzio. The renowned ichnographic project illustrates an urban district that is at once unified by a single language derived from Roman ruins and composed as a conflict of extremes between discrete, exceedingly monumental complexes and buildings.</p><p>Tafuri&rsquo;s hypothesis is a prescient, allegorical narrative of the historical process of disenchantment that ensued from the multiplication of sacred icons repurposed again and again for secular functions, from the house to the bank and ultimately to the gas station. The city evoked by Camp Marzio is composed only of a monstrous or sublime collection of colossal symbols of power vying for supremacy and ultimately canceling one another out.</p><p>Aldo Rossi, a contemporary of Tafuri&rsquo;s, characterized the city as transhistorical and analogical. His non-narrative drawings, akin to still lifes, depict everyday objects alongside numerous types of building fragments, ruinous or unfinished. If analogy promises to synthesize disparate, unrelated and incommensurately scaled objects, architecture and urban morphology are destined to be manifest only in fragments. Any dream of narrativity or coherence is consciously irretrievable.</p><p>The projects of the studio will originate in one or a hybrid of these two theorizations of wholes and fragments with the aim to transformatively distill or resist the archipelagic propensity of architecture. Students will either design large buildings that define a synecdoche &ndash; i.e., a &ldquo;city within a building&rdquo; &ndash; or design prototypical housing units and sets/systems thereof that aggregate to produce a legible, discrete fragment of urban morphology derived from singular or hybrid precedents.</p><p>The studio will invest considerable time exploring the anticipated experience of units and their arrangements with emphasis on contemporary modes of living as well as the multivalent interrelationships of the units with the building, street, block, and urban morphology.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Though the primary intention of the studio project is theoretical, it will be embodied by economically viable and sustainable proposals for a 110 acre site in Alameda, CA, the best remaining development opportunity along the bay&rsquo;s eastern waterfront.</p><p>Students working in pairs will develop urban designs for between 2.8 and 5.6 million ft2 of multi-use.

This new monastic prototype is based in the writings and teachings of inter-spiritual modern-day monks, Brother Thomas Merton and Brother Wayne Teasdale.</p><p>Our monastic prototypes will be sited in Colonia Atlampa, a re-emerging neighborhood within a former industrial zone northwest of the historic center of Mexico City.&nbsp; The monastery will contribute to the comprehensive regeneration of the Atlampa neighborhood, with human, social, economic, and cultural development.&nbsp; We will travel to Mexico City for a week, visiting historical, cultural, architectural, and religious sites, including monasteries.&nbsp; A master planning workshop for our site will be held in the offices of renowned Mexican architect Javier Sanchez, located in a renovated ice factory adjacent to our site.</p><p>Fundamentally, this studio aims to broaden our understanding of architectural space and typologies.&nbsp; Through an examination of the fundamental values of architecture in space, light, and material, conceived as the setting for experiences, we will resist the limiting prejudices of a pictorial architecture manifested through overt transparency, shallowness, and structural legibility &hellip;the thin, fast and explicit.&nbsp; The excessive transparency of modern architecture is so often saturated with light and overexposed. What is often far more inspiring are spaces where there is more darkness than light, more mystery than clarity - spaces that are thick, slow, and implicit. These tonal spaces unite the traditional and the modern through a preference for an emotive and sensual interiority where a relative absence of light invites us to linger, to experience the eternal, the atmospheric, the ambient.</p><p>Our ambition is to put forward a logic that opens the raw repressed power of architecture and the environment through a re-thinking and re-making of where we already are.&nbsp; This translogic will function as the basis for your work, developed as a comprehensive, integrated system of inter-scalar relationships &ndash; sensual and sensible - with authenticity and integrity that do not rely on store-bought theories and conventional expectations.&nbsp; Ultimately, we are motivated by the search for an architecture of use and beauty, deeply rooted to its place, sensitively responsive to its environment, constructed within a material culture with an emotive atmosphere and poetic qualities that affect us deeply&hellip;a SpiritForm Revival!</p>"

It is about reflecting on the nature of building, and the various ways in which the conceptual breakthroughs performed by unsuspecting actors of the design and manufacturing world enrich our disciplinary understanding of architecture and urbanity.</p><p>The studio concludes a line of enquiry carried out in 2018-19 and 2022 with a renewed focus on the unique, all-American cultural phenomenon known as a the Modern Home &ndash;or Kit House. This quintessentially American experiment lasted from 1908 to the Great Depression (the last batch shipped around 1940).</p><p>The mail-order only Kit House was disseminated through Modern Homes Catalogues. Largely outdated by today&rsquo;s social norms, this marketing literature did capture a moment of boundless American optimism, a can-do attitude, and a refreshing faith in everyone&rsquo;s ability to build their own home. With its agnostic approach to architectural style and embrace of new technology, the Kit House set out some ground rules OSM still abides by today.</p><p>BRIEF:<br />Starting with a renewed appreciation of the economic, social and cultural ambitions of OSM Participants are invited to propose a contemporary concept of the Kit House. The brief is completely open, but we will pay special attention to the following design issues: Identity and Culture. Modularity. Assembly. Packaging. Shipping, Documentation and Nomenclature (Building by Numbers).</p><p>SITE:<br />OSM being first and foremost a matter of cultural geography, site is not a priority as such. In keeping with the American character of the concept and its broadly rural resonance, the studio will concentrate on a rural corridor off Everett Road in the town of Norfolk MA, where land is zoned for single-family dwellings.

        "course_description": "<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>The contemporary is a moving ratio of modernity, moving through the recent past and near future in a nonlinear space that gauges modernity as an ethos already becoming historical.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Paul Rabinow, Marking Time</p><p>In a now well-known story, the decades since 1970 have seen a quiet &ldquo;economization&rdquo; of public space. Though diverse in its locational details and regional variables, in many cities the overall effect has been to render the concept of public space&mdash;historically an essential ingredient of democratic life&mdash;if not anachronistic, at least endangered. In a cruel irony, the &ldquo;neo-liberalization&rdquo; of urban space unfolds as a mostly unseen erasure of the spatial foundations of liberalism&rsquo;s basic elements&mdash;enumerated by Wendy Brown as &ldquo;vocabularies, principles of justice, political cultures, habits of citizenship, practices of rule, and above all, democratic imaginaries.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Today this condition raises basic questions: <em>how can publics still be assembled? </em>Where, if not in the old, familiar places&mdash;the city square, the free press, the candidate&rsquo;s debate&mdash;can differences be publicly exercised? &nbsp;</p><p>This studio argues that one possible site for contemporary political assembly is aesthetic life. This does not imply that the <em>content </em>of aesthetic work must become explicitly political, but rather that &ldquo;art&rdquo; (very broadly conceived) and the institutions where it is housed, can form spaces, arenas, and backgrounds for publics. These formations do not <em>de facto</em> result simply from the display of art, but depend upon commitments from directors, curators, etc., They also depend upon specific spatial and material conditions that can be called <em>the</em> <em>architecture of art</em>. In our work this semester, this phrase indicates more than (and is at times even critical of) &ldquo;museum design.&rdquo; It instead requires asking how an aesthetic institution can be made into a site for the reproduction of publics, which, by their very nature, are temporary and require constant revivification.</p><p>These theoretical concerns will be explored across two nearly adjacent sites in downtown Los Angeles. The first is the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA. Originally called &ldquo;the Temporary Contemporary,&rdquo; MOCA Geffen is housed in an existing building on the border between in LA&rsquo;s Little Tokyo and Arts districts. We will work with MOCA&rsquo;s curatorial staff to imagine possibilities for &ldquo;The WAREHOUSE&rdquo;&mdash;the only zone of the original building untouched by Frank Gehry&rsquo;s 1982-83 adaptation of the building for use as galleries. Today, the WAREHOUSE serves as an empty space for staging events and public programs, but it has never benefitted from any cohesive architectural agenda.</p><p>A second site, less than a block away, will rework a lost opportunity: the recently completed Little Tokyo/Arts District Metro Station. Despite city incentives to densify housing at and near metro stations, however, only a single-story pavilion was constructed as an entry point to the underground station. We will reimagine this as the site of a new multistorey structure for housing MOCA&rsquo;s new artists residency program, including live/work studios, administrative offices, and other functions.</p><p>Taken together, the two projects&mdash;one, an adaptive reuse design for MOCA&rsquo;s public programming; the other a new home for the making of contemporary art&mdash;aim towards a single thesis: that formal, material, and programmatic speculation can result in the architectural production of an aesthetic site for public politics.

        "course_description": "<p>Urban Glitch is a studio designed to research the pressing issue of systems-linked architecture in relation to the complex and intertwined ecological and social imperatives of our time. We will embrace architecture as anti-autonomous, as an agent of urban change that is necessarily collaborative, connected, and contingent; as a mode of engaged cultural production that requires fresh operational positions to facilitate this agency.</p><p>As a way into a more radical approach to the often-codified middle scale of urban form, the studio will collectively imagine an alternative present -- an urban glitch -- in which our architectural imagination is contingent upon altered and re-imagined outcomes to an event or decision in recent history that shapes the current status quo mode of operation and consumption within the built environment. The goal of this counterfactual approach to design production is to explore the spaces where current and future decisions are not fixed, where a combination of design imagination and radical pragmatism can impact the deep DNA and embedded path dependencies that shape our built world, and that generate or dissolve design&#39;s capacity to make change.</p><p>In practical terms, the studio will address the intersection of transportation infrastructure and architecture. The program is a mixed-use transit hub in Boston that accommodates public and private mobility within a paradigm of infrastructural decarbonization. We will travel to Amsterdam to learn from a system of urban infrastructure that yields dynamic forms of personal and shared mobility and a diverse range of buildings to store, charge, and host it. We will collaborate with artists, policymakers, and engineers, among others, to consider the following questions within the context of the design process:</p><p>What is the role of the middle scale of architecture in re-programming patterns of urban mobility for an era of decarbonization? Who owns, rents, and maintains our urban infrastructure, and what happens to urban form if variables of use and ownership change? What urban mechanics are contingent or changeable, and what conditions are inevitable factors in the shaping of 21st-century architectural form? What are the opportunities presented by an architecture of dependence in which form must act in concert with the larger conditions and constructs that drive urban change? What is the disposition and agency of a public architecture in an era of private capital? How and when does architecture have the power to act up and down the scales of the built environment?</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>Spolia, derived from the Latin word for &quot;spoils&quot; or &quot;booty,&quot; involves repurposing art and architectural elements from previous constructions or demolished structures. The practice dates back to the Constantine era, exemplified by the renowned Arch of Constantine (315 AD). In this historical context, Spolia served an ideological purpose, as &quot;spoils&quot; were transported over long distances to be incorporated into new monuments, imbuing them with symbolic meaning. The Arch of Constantine, for instance, utilized diverse construction parts from various origins to create a monument of imperial propaganda.</p><p>In contemporary times, Spolia finds application in both pragmatic and ideological realms. On a practical level, it entails recycling architectural elements or materials to create sustainable new buildings. This approach reduces carbon footprints, as materials are sourced closer to the desired building location, in contrast to the extensive transportation involved in Roman times. Ideologically, Spolia offers an alternative approach to construction, embracing our history, learning, and acknowledging past mistakes.</p><p>Anticipating the future, the architecture and construction sectors bear the responsibility of finding solutions to mitigate the environmental impact of building. Our focus this semester revolves around drawing inspiration from the ancient practice of Spolia and seamlessly integrating it into contemporary architecture. Engaging in this transformative process provides an opportunity to reassess various aspects of our lives, from societal structures to our perspectives on living and interpersonal relationships.</p><p>In this studio, we undertake the assembly of 800 stones repurposed from the remnants of a Portuguese quarry. Within the realm of architecture and design, stone emerges as a silent storyteller, a material that goes beyond its apparent stillness to embody a unique form of vitality. Rather than a static substance, stone reveals itself as a living material&mdash;a narrative that breathes history, carries the weight of time, and resonates with the echoes of the past. With a profound understanding of this living material, our goal is to craft a space for &quot;long living.&quot; These stones, weathered by time, bear the marks of their experiences, much like the wrinkles etched on the faces of those who have traversed the passages of life. Metaphorically aligning stone with age, our focus is on creating an open environment dedicated to the well-being of the elderly. We actively challenge preconceptions surrounding age, aging, decay, and wrinkles, delving into the parallels between human and material nature.</p><p>By reshaping perceptions of old age as a valuable societal resource, we simultaneously reassess material resources and spatial programming. Our emphasis lies on spatial ergonomics, materiality, and multifunctionality, as we explore the dynamic interplay between the enduring nature of stone and the multifaceted aspects of the human experience</p><p>The chosen site is in Melides, Portugal, and our study trip will unveil the unique characteristics of the location.</p><p>Key Learnings:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Designing with a focus on material resources, particularly understanding stone as a material.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Executing design through research, treating the project as an archaeology of the future.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Programmatic research and questioning to inform the design process.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Cultivating critical thinking toward social constructs.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Incorporating ecosystem thinking into the design approach.</p>"

Can it seek and imagine an alternative strategy, an architecture, that is more attuned to the nuances of relations between the social and the natural worlds and between scales and typologies of construction?</strong></p><p>The proliferation of large urban developments in Tokyo is symptomatic of the increasing privatization of the public domain. Roppongi Hills, Tokyo Midtown, Toranomon Hills, COREDO Muromachi, and Azabudai Hills are among the completed megaprojects by a handful of big developers that are rapidly and dramatically changing the urban landscape and public life of the city.</p><p>The consumerist culture embedded in these technically accomplished and often lavishly made developments can be alluring. But these privately owned public spaces can also be exclusionary and challenging for the public to occupy and use with the same degree of freedom as they would a city street. Despite their thermal comfort and irresistible charm, these megaprojects seem blatantly to defy Henri Lefebvre&rsquo;s argument for &ldquo;the right to the city&rdquo; and its implied erasure of social and spatial inequity.</p><p>This option studio will explore an alternative strategy based on the simultaneous choreography of a multitude of architectural ideas and interventions&mdash;of different scales and typologies, hybrids&mdash;that represent the needs and desires of Tokyoites to live together. Our intention is to shift the emphasis in contemporary development from the economies of scale to the economies of scope, an approach characterized by variety rather than volume.</p><p>The location for the projects will be a series of urban sites close to Ueno and the public park that was established in the nineteenth century. The park contains several museums and cultural institutions, including the city&rsquo;s zoo and the National Museum of Western Art, the only building by Le Corbusier in Japan. The area also encompasses two of Tokyo&rsquo;s foremost academic institutions, the University of Tokyo and Tokyo University of the Arts.</p><p>The area of investigation by the studio will be the urban spine connecting these institutions to the nearby neighborhood of Yanesen. The framing of the programs will take into consideration a diversity of topics, including culture and the everyday, the changes in the demography of Tokyo, the needs of young and old, the future consequences of degrowth, as well as alternative conceptions of the relation between architecture and nature.</p><p>If Ueno Park represents the nineteenth-century vision of culture/nature, how can the phenomenon be reconceptualized today? How can architecture&rsquo;s situatedness within a broader environmental agenda help structure our contemporary projects? To achieve this task, each student will choose their own site/s and program/s with the aim of designing an architectural intervention or ensemble that will reconsider and question the role of scale and typology as a means of enhancing the quality of life of the district.</p><p>The studio will meet regularly on Tuesdays and Thursdays and will travel to Tokyo in February. During this period, we will meet with several architects and academics, and participate in tours and talks with scholars including Kumiko Kiuchi and Shunya Yoshimi, one of Japan&rsquo;s foremost scholars on Tokyo. Tom Heneghan, Mits Kanada, Yusuke Obuchi and Kayoko Ota will guide us through parts of our area. As in previous years, Professor Mits Kanada, a structural engineer who has worked with Toyo Ito and other contemporary architects, will act as the technical advisor to the studio.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

From Boston to Hong Kong, this shift among port cities often involves a transition away from previous activities of shipping, commerce, and trade, and toward new civic and domestic models of public space and housing. Yet, the evolution of the water&rsquo;s edge is seldom a tidy process, offering a unique opportunity for critique, intervention and design imagination.</p><p>Traveling to Copenhagen over spring break, the studio seeks to reconcile the specific forces at work in Denmark, at the confluence of a water-shaped civic landscape, a porous matrix of aggregated dwelling, and the Nordic concept of &lsquo;Hygge,&rsquo; loosely defined as domestic coziness or togetherness.&nbsp; What is a contemporary interpretation of hygge and how can this culturally specific concept recast traditional modes of housing and provide alternatives to market-driven criteria?&nbsp; How is hygge rooted in climate and material culture, and how might we create a personal response to the evolving legacy of Danish modernism? Can emerging low-carbon material and construction technologies contribute to an architectural expression while addressing needs for water management and resiliency?</p><p>Copenhagen exemplifies a proactive approach to climate resiliency, and investment in its vulnerable waterfront, resulting in an on-going master planning effort, won in competition by the Danish firm Cobe in 2008. Aimed at integrating existing and new infrastructure, transforming Nordhavn&rsquo;s water-front edges, and satisfying Copenhagen&rsquo;s need for housing, the Cobe plan and other realized architecture and landscape projects, will serve as a foundation for our study to explore and advance site-specific housing proposals. &nbsp;</p><p>Dense urban housing typically manifests in repetitive patterns of unit aggregation, mirrored and stacked pragmatically, relying on double-loaded corridors for efficiency, and often stuffed into arbitrary envelopes, absent of a socially binding civic promenade, geometric variation or domestic ambiance. As a counterpoint to the repetitive stack and its proclivity for alienation, we will conceptualize housing and urban landscape as a contiguous, fully connected pedestrian terrain that wends its way horizontally and vertically, seeking light and air, re-imagining the ground plane, and offering unique opportunities for architectural expression&mdash;in other words, we will integrate hydrology, housing, and hygge. Implicit in this act is a resistance to an overly privatized landscape and an active study of grade and circulation as collective tissue. Housing is thereby imagined as a porous container set amidst a terraformed landscape and skin, a shaped vessel that owes as much to its interior contour as to its exterior figuration. This approach questions the distinctions between private and public realms as typically defined by building skin, aspiring to reconcile a programmatically rich interior with an architecture of sculptural, civic and ecological presence.</p>"

Just as our room is now, so it will be in the world to come; where our baby sleeps now, there too it will sleep in the other world. And the clothes we wear in this world, those too we will wear there. Everything will be as it is now, just a little different.&quot;</p><p>Architecture may have been a little lazy. First, its long-held infatuation with newness &ndash; new forms, new media, new materials, new images, and new urgencies, creates a convex gaze of the field that often small and superficial (new) elements are magnified and obscure the complacency underneath. Then it has also perfected the art of copy-pasting through best practices, standardization, and as-of-right developments. Repeated enough times, the mundane becomes best-of-class. Finally, we seem to have forgotten the wonderous world of kintsugi, spolia, and metamorphosis, where that which has passed and which is to come engage in an alchemic dance of co-creation. The old scribes memories and histories for the new, for it to gain meaning and purpose, and thrust the mere possible into contingent.</p><p>The Coming Community studio turns its cheek away from tabula rasa and earnestly examines the fossils of architecture, including those that are no longer replicated. It refrains from the acritical production of complacent architectural objects varnished in a thin layer of newness and instead takes &ldquo;disdained&#39;&#39; architectural elements &ndash; their outdated forms, overlooked (mis)uses, obsolete programs, (dis)functional parts, expiring materials, antiquated systems, and forgotten desires, and embed within, bond together, trace over and transform them anew. We explore the threshold where the past transgresses into the coming through the love affair between the old and the new. As the world becomes increasingly atomized and siloed, capitals increasingly consolidated, and unbridled material and energy extraction increasingly unsustainable, such critical discovery and nuanced interpretation of and more empathic attitude towards the past might bring worthy profit.</p><p>The site for The Coming Community studio at GSD 24&rsquo; is the Guggenheim Museum, one of Frank Lloyd Wright&rsquo;s latest works, completed in 1959. In 1990, the Guggenheim Museum was the youngest building to gain city landmark status. It is now designated as a National Historic Landmark and appears on the World Heritage List. Implicated by its own success, the architecture of the Guggenheim Museum has crystallized into a hermetic object, with the years passing, becoming fossilized in the past. What would it take for the Guggenheim Museum to not only be preserved but also to be alive? How can the whispers in its everyday hum be amplified and say something relevant today? Can we imagine a Coming Community for the iconic building that promises a future that is &ldquo;just a little different&rdquo;?</p><p>The design process takes the dual track of research and experimentation. Final designs will be represented through one model, drawings, and two printed archives catalogs. They will be exhibited and circulated at the museum in a form still to be determined.</p>"

The studio will speculate on the potential to turn construction from a major CO2 contributor to a sequestration industry -- a strategic device -- that demonstrates the ingenuity of an architectural response. Our model of inquiry will focus on stone as an ancient actor on the stage shared by architecture and engineering with the goal of lowering the carbon footprint of new midrise buildings. Aided by recent technological development, this ancient material is in search of a new language.

This exercise will allow us to make informed choices that assemble a carbon-negative result while prompting a theoretical position that internalizes the technical as part of the intellectual apparatus for the project students will design.</p><p>Our base ingredients of stone and timber both need next to no processing and are validated by the climate crisis.

This revelation arrives amid a broader national discourse on reconciliation and remediation of our country&rsquo;s oppressive history. The Reconstructions Options Studio engages with this report and additional literature to critically analyze and respond to the spatial, programmatic, and political implications emerging from such histories, both locally and globally. We understand architecture not as an isolated remedy but as an integral part of a broader array of strategies and future visions aimed at addressing the legacies of violence entrenched in our built environment.</p><p>The course challenges students to transition from passive observers to active participants by recognizing, evaluating, and responding to the complex racialized political systems that inform both our tangible and conceptual spaces. This process involves reimagining the potential of architecture in crafting new typologies of freedom through the dismantling of oppressive systems.</p><p>Reflecting on the post-Civil War era, the Reconstruction period was a time of revolutionary potential, marked by efforts such as colonization plans for the South, the redistribution of abandoned lands, and the extension of rights and services, including voting rights, healthcare, and education, to formerly enslaved individuals. Despite these progressive initiatives, subsequent political and social maneuvers ultimately undercut the transformative potential of Reconstruction. Through political disenfranchisement, spatial restriction, and the manipulation of historical narratives, the era&#39;s reparative actions were significantly undermined.</p><p>The perpetuation of oppressive ideologies often depends on the construction of a monolithic narrative, the commemoration of those narratives within our physical infrastructures, and the consequent obliteration of alternative historical narratives. As Paula Gunn Allen succinctly put it, &quot;The root of all oppression is the loss of memory,&quot; suggesting that the foundation of liberation is, conversely, the unyielding preservation and recognition of memory&mdash;in culture, tradition, land, and place.</p><p>In opposition to power systems that necessitate the erasure of memory from marginalized groups for the sake of assimilation, Design Justice posits that the narratives we craft about places matter. Architecture, as a language, equips us with the means to narrate complex stories&mdash;because stories are powerful. They embed themselves in our locales, from neighborhoods to blocks to buildings, transforming memory into a monument. Thus, the place becomes significant. The cultural narratives that we allow to prevail in the built environment give birth to places of culture&mdash;because culture matters profoundly.</p><p>In this studio, we endeavor to confront and ideate upon the physical manifestations of spatial reparation that are necessary as frameworks for liberation.

Traditionally, the program has served as a platform for young creative boutique offices, privileging artistic merit over experience.</p><p>The studio will ask three new fundamental questions the program has yet to address, proposing projects departing from new techniques and ways to survey the beautiful Norwegian landscape.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Vision and technology<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - New scales<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - The road as culture</p><p>We will explore how technology shapes a designer&#39;s relation to beautiful scenery. In Norway, sophisticated high-resolution surveys and databases of the landscape are publicly available. Architects and landscape architects still need to capitalize on this rich material. We will explore techniques to translate these sophisticated surveys into concrete spatial decisions. This methodology is equally helpful for architects and landscape architects and opens the poetic evaluation of these sophisticated documents beyond their technical implications.</p><p>The second question is about scale and media. As there is increasing pressure to produce new projects that go beyond beautiful objects amidst beautiful scenery, landscape architects are gaining relevance for the program; at the same time, architects are pushed to expand the limits of the poetic object in connection to environmental concerns.</p><p>New sites for the scenic routes include mining sites amidst astonishing landscapes, creating the need to design projects in between architecture and landscape architecture that can simultaneously address nature&#39;s exploitation and the extreme beauty of their situations.</p><p>Projects proposed in the studio will also contribute to the evolving nature of road and car culture in some of Northern Europe&#39;s most delicate landscapes, a rapidly changing subject posing new design questions.</p>"

Its owner, the Port Authority, has the intention of developing the site. However, for the past 75 years the site has also been the home of an informal settlement, the largest in the city. The site gathers and magnifies all the contemporary challenges of Bangkok: flooding, exclusion, uncontrolled market forces, and significant impacts of climate change. At the same time, there is much inspiration to be gained from its past and present. We are inspired by the history of the encounter between water and city in Bangkok, and by the vibrant spaces of exchange and social adaptation in a watery terrain. We are also interested in the way extreme density induces the creative adaptation of places, making us realize our own rigid ways of assigning programs to spaces, and of making unnecessary boundaries that curtail possibilities for the enrichment of social life.</p><p>The studio will build upon the work of students developed during the 2022 Spring semester led by Anita Berrizbeitia and Alejandro Echeverri. This work provides foundational information about Bangkok and the Khlong Toei site. Four proposals will be examined in detail, critiqued, and advanced as design exercises. Pedagogically, this is a unique opportunity to develop interpretative and design developments skills that evolve a concept into advanced stages of design.</p><p>Working individually and in teams, students will focus on a deeper exploration of the canal system as a socio-ecological network, on the equitable distribution of shade and ventilation-producing canopy, on the integration of socio-economic communities within the urban block, on the different scales and modalities of sharing climate vulnerabilities, on alternative forms of public space, and on the equal distribution of life-enhancing resources and services, a landscape of equity and prosperity for all. This is a sponsored studio, its results will serve to catalyze conversations.</p><p>The studio will travel to Bangkok for one week. The studio will be led by Anita Berrizbeitia and Ignacio Bunster-Ossa, with regular participation of Kotchakorn Voraakhomm, and faculty from the GSD and Bangkok.</p>"

Luxury resorts, villas, golf courses, and settlements for an international elite with the un-proportional need for water for lifestyle, lush gardens, and pools lowered the groundwater level for dozens of meters in a short time, dried out the traditional Khettaras. Most of the Palm trees died, and the local communities were impoverished.</p><p>Since 2001, UNESCO and official institutions from Morocco have faced the problem and taken initiatives to retrieve the Palmeraie of Marrakech. But climatic change with years of never-seen drought and never-measured peeks of temperature turn even the most intensively irrigated golf greens into shabby patchwork quilts, and the way of urbanizing and living in the Palmeraie gets into its final phase of obsolescence. Even though the earthquake of September 2023 damaged Marrakech and its surroundings less destructively compared to the mountain villages in the High Atlas, the consequences for the poorer population in the &#39;douars&#39; of the Palmeraie are furthermore threatening.</p><p>Just in October 2023, FIFA designated the World Soccer Championship 2030 to Morocco/Portugal/Spain. Marrakech, and particularly the Palmeraie, will be one of the main competition sites.</p><p>The option studio Under the Palm Trees will engage these topics under the ambiguous notation of the beauty and imagination of an oasis and the reality of death, drought, and destruction:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Understanding and mapping the evolution of the Plamerie of Marrakech as an artificial oasis created in a traditional Muslim-Berber way of settlement in arid areas and the architectonical and general culture of this specific territorial approach;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Elaboration of new design-based strategies for water management and local solutions for villages, agriculture, resorts, and other kinds of settlements valorizing the specific cultural dimension;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Revaluation of &bdquo;earth building&ldquo; and traditional adobe construction techniques of the Muslim-Berber culture under the view of a post-seismic defamation;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Integration of new sources of decentralized energy production, smart grids, and alternative mobility in a renewed and reconstructed landscape with historical value;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Spatial and territorial negotiation of extreme social differences for synergetic design solutions;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Proposals for temporary interventions for the FIFA World Soccer Championship 2023, ensuring synergetic effects for the territory.</p><p>Every student should develop a general position on at least one of the topics and develop large-scale or local design solutions for the communities. The critical reading of the Palmeraie, its threats, and the elaborated design solutions will be site-specific but also generally valid for similar situations in the Global South &hellip; and not only!

        "course_description": "<p>The studio is about housing and recasting ideas of the good life amidst contemporary challenges. It centers on the currently unfolding housing legislation in New Zealand that stipulates a blanket increase of residential densities in the major cities to meet acute shortages. Colloquially known as the 3x3 rule, the zoning limit is raised to allow three apartments or townhouses on all residential land, marking a significant break from the long adherence to single-family houses on quarter-acre lots. Beneath the debate about economic and technical constraints, the core problem concerns dearly held ideas of the good life intimately associated with tropes of the single-family house, from backyard BBQs to DIY in the garage. While the situation is distinctly Kiwi, the challenge of transforming existing low-density neighborhoods to meet pressing environmental and demographic challenges has urgent international resonances.<br />&nbsp;<br />Historically, New Zealand has often found itself a natural laboratory for new policies, products, and ways of living - from women&#39;s suffrage to the minimum wage and the eight-hour workday. The current circumstances present a rare and significant natural experiment to study key issues in contemporary housing and urban district-making. First is the idea of affording housing as a right and the question of how a distinct and high quality of life closely associated with low-density suburbs might be articulated and adapted to more resilient and sustainable patterns of settlement. Second is the urban architecture problem of moving from low to mid-density housing, which exacerbates challenges of safety, privacy, and long-term adaptability that require careful resolution, particularly in the seismic, multi-cultural, and climate-sensitive Oceanic context. Third is the circumstantial opportunity for leapfrog development to establish alternative modes of housing production and ownership, such as advanced timber construction in the logistically remote yet forest-rich country.<br />&nbsp;<br />The studio is critically situated to learn from and contribute to an evolving and fast-moving situation. As output, students will produce and publish a public-facing think-piece illustrated by the design scheme, examining and recasting a familiar trope of the good life to catalyze an informed public debate on housing in a moment of transition. The studio is organized around three lines of inquiry. First is a longitudinal survey of ideas of the good life, tracing the debate back to its historical and philosophical basis of how such things can be defined and measured, and forward to cross-cultural variations and comparisons, including the emergence of Japanese and Scandinavian design as shareable ideas in the late 20th century. Second is a deep dive into the Kiwi milieu as the basis for articulating a local yet shareable idea of the good life compatible with contemporary challenges. Third is the design and communication of housing both as a building and an idea, learning from the arrival and unfolding of modernizing influences in the Austronesian milieu to amplify this work&#39;s reception and impact on housing outcomes in the near future.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>The studio explores the role of design in emerging forms of public-sector housing development in the United States. Our testing ground is a former industrial site in Central Falls, Rhode Island currently being acquired by the municipality. Given the need to consider a range of physical scales and temporal dimensions in this endeavor, the studio explicitly seeks to include students from across the school&#39;s programs.</p><p>Direct public-sector development of housing has been a political no-go in the United States since the mid-1970s. After the purported failure of federal public housing, the private sector was considered better equipped to build and operate housing for low- and moderate-income households. The fact that such housing is made profitable only with massive public investment through tax breaks and rental subsidies, or that this housing remains affordable for a limited time only, is often left unsaid.</p><p>Today, the persistent lack of affordable housing has turned this argument on its head. Why subsidize the private sector if the public sector could more cost effectively finance, build, and operate homes and keep these affordable in the long term? Several jurisdictions have begun to set up new entities toward this end. They include Montgomery County, MD; Seattle, WA; and Atlanta, GA. California, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island are considering similar measures at the state level. Rather than building public housing that serves only the poor, however, these new models create social housing for a broader demographic.</p><p>What often falls short in these legislative efforts is a consideration of the role of physical design. When speed, quantity, and affordability are the goal, design quality&mdash;however understood&mdash;quickly takes a back seat. Most bills thus make only vague, if any, references to siting, housing type and size, flexible programs, energy efficiency standards, or other aspects crucial for the long-term viability of the public investment.</p><p>How, then, can architects, landscape architects, urban designers, and planners articulate, in intelligible and politically actionable terms, how design decisions contribute to public-sector housing development and vice versa? We will explore his challenge through a proposal for the Central Falls site. In addition, we will focus on the various ways in which housing design is codified and made replicable, including through design guidelines, funding formulas, performance criteria, and procurement processes, to name a few. Designing these conditions is an essential part of the exploration.</p><p>Throughout the semester, readings on the relationship of design ideas and public-sector housing will expand our understanding of the historical dimension of contemporary challenges. On a field trip to Atlanta we will engage with the past, present, and future of the public developer in a fast-changing city. In the 1930s, Atlanta was home to some of the first federal public housing developments; by the 1990s, these projects were demolished and rebuilt as mixed-income housing in public-private partnerships; in 2023, the creation of the Atlanta Urban Development Corporation moves control of development back to a public entity.</p>"

As part of a sustainable transition of our societies, it is necessary to consider how we can make better use these vast material resources. Research point to the environmental potentials of reusing the already built environment through practices of adaptive reuse, rather than building new. The importance and potential of doing so is also mentioned in the latest IPCC report, particularly pertaining to the cities in the developed world.

Over time, a series of contextual pressures generated conventions of imaging the three-dimensional world within a two-dimensional boundary.</p><p>Representation is not a conclusive index of an architecture already designed and completed, in the past tense. Rather, representation is integral to the design process and the production of architecture - it is present and future tense: an active participant in seeing and making. It occurs in multiple instances and forms over the evolution of a project. Though not deterministic of the architecture, representation techniques selected to visualize ideas influence the evolution and outcome of the work.</p><p>This course examines the origins of conventional representational techniques as well as contemporary interpretations, rituals, and even thoughtful misuse. We will explore through close reading the realm of orthographic and oblique projection in its history as well as recent practice, followed by a set of thematic contemporary influences. Among these are topics such as the influence of image and material within texture maps and projection, a fascination with flatness, and the methodologies for which they might be generative for design.

Yet all these geometries are present in any work of architecture. This course is an exploration into resolving interactions between geometries and seeking discoveries in their convergence and divergence.</p><p>The work in this course takes place in three modes: generation, interaction, assembly.&nbsp; Over the exercises, students study the geometry of surfaces paired with the geometry of an interacting architectural force (circulation and accessibility or sunlight) and the geometry of thickness, frame and joint. These three explorations in dialog lead to architectural fragments that perform a balancing act. Each interacting geometry creates a pre-condition for program.&nbsp; Circulation and accessibility require flat floors, sunlight needs controlled apertures, thickness requires material dimensions. These requirements are those which abstract geometry, traditionally, has trouble accepting and are also lasting sources of invention in a discipline that must cross from imagination to reality.</p><p>The class proceeds from and reflects on practice through case study examples. In any real building project, the richness of the interplay between goals and constraints arising from the extraordinary specificity of site, client, material economy and interdisciplinary discussion makes the accurate resolution of intersections in space a practical necessity and brings geometry out of abstraction. Geometry also provides a means of adjusting flexibly as design progresses towards construction and new requirements reveal themselves. The exercises in this class create a microcosm of these interactions with the goal of developing tools for precision, adaptability, permutation and resolution of tension.</p>"
