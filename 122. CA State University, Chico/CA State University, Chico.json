The emergence of commercial tourism made social and cultural contact into a form of recreation and a booming business. Indeed, contact among diverse cultures has always been an engine of historical change. Students in this course explore dimensions of the tourism industry, motivations for travel, and how tourism transforms landscapes, heritage, and social relations around the world. Sometimes these transformations are for the better, but all too often the quest for the extraordinary destroys the very thing tourists seek. Learn why and how in case studies spanning from Jamaica to Singapore. 3 hours  lecture."
