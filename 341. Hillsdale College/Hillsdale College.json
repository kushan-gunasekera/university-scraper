The nature of war is a \"violent clash of interests between or among organized groups,\" and just as our nature drives us to collaborate in peace, our fallen nature drives us to kill in war. Using the Marine Corps' highly influential doctrinal text on war and warfighting (Marine Corps Doctrinal Publication 1: Warfighting) as a guiding text, this course will explore the nature and conduct of war in each of its levels: tactical, operational, and strategic. It seeks to understand war as a part of the human condition and the broad impact it has had throughout history including as recorded in the arts. It explores the evolution of maneuver warfare in the modern era, its chief architects, and examples of it in action. This course will expose participants in a small degree to some of the environmental and psychological aspects of warfighting through puzzles, physical scenarios, and tactical decision games.

Peel away our modern penchant for scientific theory, practical skills, and psychological assessments, and we find that teaching and learning leadership is essentially a problem of human moral development-of becoming morally mature and possessing the virtues of character requisite to the responsibilities and challenges of leadership. This three-credit one-semester course takes an eclectic approach drawing on the experience and wisdom of the best classical and modern \"thinkers and doers\" of leadership. The emphasis is formative: to broaden and deepen students' understanding of the practical and moral complexities of leadership and to help students begin to cultivate in a serious way the virtues of character and moral maturity that will make them worthy of leadership. The format is more like a developmental seminar than a traditional academic class: materials, class discussion, assignments and evaluation are all designed for students to make a close, critical, and personal study of leadership culminating in a personal leadership philosophy. The class is required for the Military Leadership minor but is open to all students with an interest in leadership, virtues, and character development. The class is also cross-listed with BUS 418: Readings in Leadership, Power, and Responsibility and may be counted toward the Military Leadership minor or as a Business elective."

The contributions of seminal thinkers and innovators such as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Locke, Hume, Kant, Mill, and Nietzsche are studied. Major works by these and other important philosophers are read, analyzed, and discussed with the aim of understanding what they argued for and against in regard to metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical issues. The course investigates to what extent they influenced their own and subsequent societies, how these philosophical systems create varying views of the world and human life, and how they address the perennial questions humans universally ask, existential questions such as, \"Is there purpose and meaning in life?\"; epistemological questions such as, \"What are the limits of human knowledge?\"; metaphysical questions such as, \"What is the ultimate nature of the reality in which we live?\", \"Is there life after death?\", \"Are humans identical to their brains?\"; and ethical questions such as, \"What is the fundamental criterion of right and wrong human action?\" In short, the course examines the main Western philosophical thinkers and traditions in an effort to understand what they have taught, why they have so taught, and how they have helped form and shape Western civilization."

Modern quantum mechanics deal with particles described as wave packets having a range of positions and momenta. This explains both the particle and wave effects observed. These wave packets are solutions of the Schrodinger wave equation and involve both space and time. The formal theory involves finding wave function solutions for harmonic oscillators, the hydrogen atom, and other systems. Physical properties of these systems are extracted from these wave functions using mathematical operators. This course is essential for those planning graduate study in physics or related areas. Required in the field of concentration."
