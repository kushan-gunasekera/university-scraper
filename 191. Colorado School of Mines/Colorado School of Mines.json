The course will involve weekly online meetings where ideas are exchanged and progress discussed within the context of design and analysis principles learned in the prerequisite courses. Students will be partnered with a faculty member affiliated with the Space Resources Program. The student will prepare a final report and presentation to present to industry collaborators, space resources faculty, and other students in the course.  The final report and/or presentation as appropriate will be converted to a journal publication, conference publication and/or research proposal and resources from the program will support student costs for publishing and/or presenting the work. This is a 16-week online course. Prerequisite: SPRS501, SPRS502, SPRS591."

To develop these relationships, and to prepare students for future roles, the Payne Institute partnered with students to develop a public policy community that uses all the School of Mines? resources to be both physical and social engineers of the world around them. One of the most prominent ways we do this is through the Payne Scholars program. This one-credit course helps students perform research, collaborate across campus, and engage with a broad network of international experts on global policy challenges. Students are taught how to write academic papers on the important issues we are facing today, and once the students finish the course, the papers they write can be published as Payne Commentaries on our website. We often sponsor students for internships, or offer student worker positions to continue their work. This often means that they get to be co-authors on peer-reviewed academic papers or help us build world-shaping policy."

Two weeks are dedicated to a student-facilitator shared experiment focusing on lock-in detection where students will learn the structure of note taking and grading. Students will then use what they learned in the lectures and tutorials to perform three experiments they help design. Although experimental results are expected and required, the course will emphasize scientific note taking and thought process over results. The experiments are intentionally open ended so students will have to think critically about their experimental methods, take detailed notes, and use trial-and-error. Thought process will be operationally defined through tinkering, resilience, teamwork, and communication."

When they take advantage of a technological innovation or respond to a crisis, leaders rely on critical skills to communicate their vision and coordinate tasks performed by others. This course is about developing your unique leadership skills and style whether you lead a small engineering team or, eventually, a large global corporation. We review key theories of leadership and examine the lessons learned from those who applied them. We synthesize and translate these lessons into specific behaviors that enhance your ability to lead. We discuss how generational shifts, economic and political factors impact the workplace in ways that call for effective, quality leadership. Ultimately, you have to understand how to lead and motivate individuals who don't look or think like you. This may involve motivating followers and involving them in making decisions. Following a learning-by-doing approach, we complement class discussions and case studies with a hands-on simulation of a leadership team facing a series of crises."

(2) How does the appearance and behavior of a robot change how humans perceive, trust, and interact with that robot? And (3) How can we design and program robots that are natural, trustworthy, and effective? Accordingly, In this course, students will learn (1) how to design interactive robots, (2) the algorithmic foundations of interactive robots; and (3) how to evaluate interactive robots. To achieve these learning objectives, students will read and present key papers from the HRI literature, and complete a final project in which they will design, pilot, and evaluate novel HRI experiments in small groups, with in-class time expected to be split between lecture by the instructor, presentations by students, and either collaborative active learning activities or discussions with researchers in the field.

How have the cultural and historical contexts in which environmental discourses have been produced affected the production and reception of those narratives and the people who perpetuate them?

A major goal of this course is to help students challenge some prevalent ideologies in Western ethics such as autonomous individualism (e.g., individuals are understood as merely rights-bearing persons). It also helps students cultivate a cultural sensitivity toward scientific and technological practice in a global context. Our exploration in this class will help students develop their ?self-knowledge? that has been extensively missing in current engineering education system. Students are encouraged to think reflectively and critically about why they are engineers, for those benefit they want to work, and the kind of world they want to design and live in by using the powerful technologies they create.

Is the universe a mindless machine? What does quantum mechanics teach us about this? What is the connection between mind and matter? (Does mind matter? Does matter mind?) Why can humans be devils or saints? What are the roles of rational thinking and intuition? This eclectic class is a true exploration in the sense that most questions above cannot be tackled as a science or engineering problem; instead, we will dive in deep together.

The Colorado River makes for an excellent point of departure because it is one of the most dammed, diverted, legislated, litigated, and loved rivers in the world and because we literally use it up; the river has seldom reached the sea since the 1960s.  Indeed, the challenges that face the Colorado River's 40 million stakeholders today have less to do with applying law and engineering to developing water resources, and much more to do with figuring out how to share an over-appropriated resource while mitigating the social and ecological consequences of past choices.  Our primary goal in the course will be to learn concepts of adaptive governance that provide a constructive and framework for analyzing and addressing such challenges.  3 hours lecture; 3 semester hours."
