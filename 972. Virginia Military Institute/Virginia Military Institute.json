Proponents of \u201cauthoritarian environmentalism\u201d contend that the leaders of a political system, insulated from popular will, possess the ability to make unilateral decisions that are needed to combat long-term issues, such as air and water pollution, and implement reforms. As we progress through this course, however, we will find that there are numerous scholars who call this argument into question. We proceed by taking stock of the environmental problems that China faces, before learning about the legal and political frameworks through which policy is made and enforced. Next, we observe how the central and local governments in China confront environmental issues to varying degrees of success. We also consider the different challenges urban and rural residents face, and the impetus for \u201cgreen\u201d movements that have emerged over the last decade. Finally, we learn of the external forces that have influenced the path China has taken, before concluding with extensive discussions of student research. All told, China\u2019s leaders may have an understanding of what environmental threats they face, but they are frequently stymied in how they approach addressing these problems; a failure to curb the dangers of environmental degradation can not only put citizen lives in jeopardy but also undermine the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s legitimacy as the ruling power and moral force at the helm of the Chinese state."

Such cooperation is important in the pursuit of global peace and development, as well as emerging issues like climate change that necessitate cooperation. This will be a seminar-style course, mixing lecture with discussion of assigned reading. You will engage with complex academic ideas while also learning the fundamentals of international organization such as how specific entities like the UN and World Bank function, and how the international community addresses problems like war, poverty, and human rights violations. The course is broken into three sections. First, we will consider different forms of international order, focusing in particular on the effectiveness of the post-WWII liberal international order. Second, we will look at how actors cooperate amid anarchy and the role that international institutions play in this. Third, we will cover specific issue areas that require international cooperation and assess how well the international community has addressed them."

After an introduction that includes a definition of terrorism and an exploration of its geneses, the course focuses on the rational and psychological aspects of the individual terrorist, terror types, strategies, and tactics, and the difficult task of counterterrorism. The final part of the course illustrates and highlights each of these aspects by examining cases culled from recent history, including the Zionist-British conflict over Palestine in the 1940s, the Algerian drive for independence in the 1950s, and the ongoing standoff between the USA and Islamic fundamentalist terrorists.

We will consider these foundational topics in depth, then examine their intersection with critical emerging issues including the politics of migration, multinational corporations, and informal markets.

As an extension of these peaceful or conflictual patterns of political interaction is the formation of formal intergovernmental organizations, such as the Arab League or the European Union. Careful attention will also be paid to those regional subsystems lacking a regional power, as is the case in the contemporary Middle East.
