Studying late antiquity, Rome's most turbulent and dynamic era, uncovers the story of such near misses and recoveries, revealing a civilization that survived for millennia through a paradoxical combination of conservatism and radical change. Even before late antiquity, Rome had changed dramatically from its origins as a city state, transforming into an imperial republic and, later, a monarchy. In late antiquity, that empire became Christian, and its monarchs became despots. Its citizens sought protection from saints as much as from soldiers, from bishops as often as from emperors. Yet for all these changes, the inhabitants of this world continued to claim, perhaps louder than ever, that they were still Romans."

Geographically, as sites of settlement, refuge, and trade, islands helped connect the ancient Mediterranean world. Illustrated presentations and class discussions explore how island societies develop and their place in the dissemination of culture in the ancient world. Study begins in prehistory with examinations of the archaeological remains on the islands of Malta, the Cyclades, Crete, and Cyprus and continues through the Roman period to include sites such as Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. Along the way, smaller island groups such as the Aeolic islands off Sicily and the Balearic Islands near Spain are explored. Artifacts and monuments including architecture, sculpture, pottery, coins, and paintings are studied in their historical and cultural context to understand the evolution of these insular societies. Study includes artifacts in the collections of the Bowdoin College Museum of Art."

This exposure has placed unprecedented pressures on countries to provide access while ensuring the protection of this important cultural heritage. Economic challenges, mass-tourism, and political strife challenge our effort to preserve the past. The heightened visibility of these remains coupled with their connections to ancient traditions has also attracted the ire of forces intent on obliterating the past. Examines the state of cultural heritage focusing on ancient sites in the Mediterranean and the Near East, including sites in Syria, Turkey, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Egypt, and Libya. Explores the factors that have placed archaeological sites in jeopardy and examines possible solutions to these challenges. Sessions in the Bowdoin College Museum of Art incorporate select examples of the ancient collection that are connected to areas of the ancient world at risk. In this setting, explores the role of museums as custodians of the past and how current events have informed the discussions around cultural patrimony."

In particular, students will learn about various dances (such as the Brazilian samba to the Cuban rumba, Jamaican Dancehall, and the Trinidadian wine) through readings, lectures, and actual in-studio dancing. Ultimately, the intention here is to understand dancing as both a meaning-making activity and a way of understanding the world. In turn, it is an important lens for critically thinking, talking, researching, and writing about politics of identity (especially regarding nationality, gender, race, and sexuality).

The Algerian War of Independence lasted nearly eight years (1954\u201362), cost between one million and one and a half million lives, saw atrocities like the use of torture by the French army and remained an obscure part of the national history of both Algeria and France. Algerian and French writers and filmmakers depict this war differently. Adopting a chronological and comparative approach to the representations of the conflict in Algeria and France, this seminar follows the various phases behind the construction of the collective memory of the Algerian War of Independence in each country. From state censorship, trauma, melancholic renderings of the past and nationalist appropriations of history, Algerian and French writers and filmmakers confront distinct problematics.

The works that survive from the classical period comprise less than 1% of all extant Latin literature and documents. In this course, we will explore the possibilities that lie within this enormous corpus of understudied Latin texts. We will focus on three primary areas: a) Late Antique Latin (roughly 200 -600), Medieval Latin (roughly 600-1300), and Renaissance and early modern Latin (roughly 1300- 1750).

This genre, in which the devoted lover laments his treatment at the hand of his fickle domina, is perhaps the most Roman of all poetic genres. It employs Greek meter and draws heavily from Greek models, and yet has no true analogue from the Hellenic world. The elegists charming, playful, and downright funny were part of a unique literary circle, and offer a rare opportunity to see how poets engaged in literary rivalry and one-upmanship. Works of the Augustan elegists Tibullus, Propertius, and Ovid are read, and the origins of elegy are discussed as well as its relationship to other genres, especially epic and oratory. Reading this comical and self-aware branch of poetry reveals insightful perspectives on conceptions of gender in the Augustan age. Also questions Latin elegy\u2019s role in challenging Roman cultural and political expectations, as the dalliances portrayed by the elegists are strikingly at odds with the social agenda of the first Roman emperor, Augustus.

The Persephone myth was commemorated in two separate works by the Augustan poet Ovid. Centuries later, in order to assert his own claim to Latin poetic excellence, the Egypto-Greek immigr\u00e9 Claudius Claudianus crafted his own retelling of the myth. In this course students read both Ovid and Claudian as they study not only the myth itself, but also how diverse Roman audiences related to it in their changing cultural contexts. Students analyze the poem as a case study in literary reception, paying close attention to the ways that these poets seek to differentiate themselves, often quite self-consciously, from their predecessors."

Students will be exposed to the choreography and practices of artists working within and across spaces of movement, healing and embodied social justice, in the process of developing and cultivating their own choreographic and community/self-care practices that bridge the disciplines of art and healing."

Through primary and secondary source materials, students will explore historical and modern understandings and practices of conversion as a signifier, rite, or ritual of entrance or immersion into a religious tradition and its community. Students will read firsthand accounts of conversions, secondhand conversion narratives, attempts to define conversion, religious guidelines for conversion, and texts examining the implications of converting away from one community and into another. Among others, accounts of apostasy, coerced conversion, conversion for the purposes of marriage or inheritance, and conversions described as spiritual epiphanies will be examined. Students will also complete a writing-focused research project on conversion over the course of the semester. The project will incorporate a series of guided assignments for each step of the research project (proposal, annotated bibliography, draft, and presentation). This managed, writing-intensive research project will allow first-year students to develop their research and writing skills at the college level while familiarizing them with the resources Bowdoin has to offer for their research. This course questions how to define conversion and whether it is possible to formulate a universal definition for conversion across religions and cultures."

If emotions are biologically innate and identical for every person, then how does religion help mediate between society and the individual? Particularly focuses on the role of emotion in both shaping and resisting social structures such as race, class, and gender. For example, during the American Revolution, ministers taught that only those with the right emotional disposition can love liberty and engage in its defense. Since enslaved peoples were seen as emotionally underdeveloped, white colonists thought them incapable of pursuing, or even deserving, liberty.

Yet it is perplexing how this familiar image of a Stoic could account for the immense popularity and persistence of the Stoic worldview. Since its beginning in the Hellenistic period, Stoicism has attracted a diverse range of followers: a slave-turned-philosopher, Epictetus; a Roman philosopher emperor, Marcus Aurelius; and a former POW, Admiral James Stockdale, among others. Our aim in this course will be to trace the development of Stoic theories, with special emphasis on Stoic ethics, philosophy of mind, and action, and examine whether these Stoic doctrines can offer credible solutions to present-day concerns. Readings will be drawn from Brad Inwood and Lloyd Gerson's The Stoics Reader, Epictetus\u2019s The Handbook, Seneca\u2019s Letters from a Stoic, Marcus Aurelius\u2019s Meditations, and Tad Brennan\u2019s The Stoic Life."

We use core concepts of queer theory to understand and resist social inequality produced by cis-heteronormativity and its intersections with racism, patriarchy, ableism and nationalism.

        "course_description": "In 1845, Frederick Douglass told his white readers: \u201cYou have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall see how a slave was made a man.\u201d This simple statement effectively describes the enduring paradox of African American male identity: although black and white males share a genital sameness, until the nation elected its first African American president the former has inhabited a culturally subjugated gender identity in a society premised on both white supremacy and patriarchy. But Douglass\u2019s statement also suggests that black maleness is a discursive construction, i.e. that it changes over time. If this is so, how does it change? What are the modes of its production and how have black men over time operated as agents in reshaping their own masculinities? Reading a range of literary and cultural texts, both past and present, students examine the myriad ramifications of, and creative responses to, this ongoing challenge. Beginning with the Class of 2025, this class will fulfill the African American, Asian American, Indigenous, Latinx, multiethnic American, or global literature requirement for English majors.

During the semester students will read some of the classic microhistory accounts, learning how the lives of peasants, formerly enslaved women, meatpackers, peddlers, and other plebeians help reconstruct a social and cultural world that is often impossible to find in traditional histories.  The course is focused on Latin America but does not require any prior knowledge of the region.  Some of the works discussed in this course are: The Cheese and the Worms, Do\u00f1a Maria\u2019s Story, & assorted essays from The Human Tradition in Latin America.\nThis course helps students to develop the skills necessary to succeed at college writing: weekly assignments will target particular skills (summarizing, analyzing, close readings, compare-contrast, etc); and\u2014given than writing is rewriting\u2014the papers familiarize students with the iterative process of revising and resubmitting, which is at the heart of academic writing.

From its founding four hundred years ago, it has endured fires, earthquakes, epidemics, and bombings, reinventing itself each time. This course takes Tokyo as its subject of study, from its supposed origins as a fishing village to its explosive growth as the castle headquarters of the Tokugawa shoguns, the command center of the Japanese empire, and finally an essential node in the global economy. Considering Tokyo as a series of transformations reveals both the power and problems of capitalism, consumerism, and industrialization, especially through the analytics of gender, class, and ethnicity. Lectures, readings, and films pay close attention to Tokyo\u2019s design, architecture, and infrastructure as shaping and being shaped by the shifting political and cultural landscape of Japan and the wider world."

Finally, we will ponder the relationship of critical race theory (a domain of critical legal studies) to contemporary philosophy of race (a domain of moral and political philosophy).

How do sad queer texts push us to acknowledge the insufficiency of progress-driven narratives that are circulated today?

He has been designated a modernist, a postmodernist and not Irish at all, having lived in France for most of his writing life: \u201cexile was a condition of Being.\u201d Beckett\u2019s reach has been enormous: his work has been the subject of numerous critical thinkers in the last century, including Theodor Adorno and Jacques Lacan, whom we will read.

Such an idea represents a turn on the classic modernist technique of \u201cstream of consciousness\u201d or the postmodern concept of \u201cmetafiction.\u201d Another staple comment about Joyce\u2019s novel suggests that the novel reads its readers, as well as, or better than, the other way around. This course will examine these ideas of novelistic knowingness through several modern and contemporary novels, drawing on a variety of narrative theories, cognitive and affect theories, and psychoanalysis.

Then shifts to a more global context considering the perspectives of women of color in countries where they have championed gender equality and feminism, and where they have become powerful political actors.

Thus, it is important to analyze and understand the process by which the court makes its decisions and policies. Investigates the processes by which cases get to the Supreme Court, are accepted or denied, and are decided. The means for investigating this process entails a semester-long simulation. Students assume the roles of the justices, the solicitor general, litigants, and other actors in the judicial system. In order to inform the simulation, students also complete focused studies of court procedures, judicial process, and judicial decision-making."

Most recently, there is an increased interest in understanding the development and impact of racial, ethnic, gender, religious, and partisan identities. This course explains these identities in the context of multicultural societies, where dividing lines often present themselves around phenotypic expression. The course begins with a psychological understanding of the self and the social identities that the self can belong to. Focusing on multiple identities, the course then presents different perspectives on how identities can be shaped and leveraged for political purposes. This seminar requires an original research project as a final outcome for the course. This course is intended for students who have completed several courses in either Government or Psychology"

We begin with the seminal studies on political behavior, such as The American Voter from 1960, which established the importance of survey research to understand why citizens do or not participate in politics. We then consider the evolution of research on political behavior, with a focus on changing methodological approaches. This includes the expanding use of surveys into the 1990s (and challenges of securing representative samples), which was followed by a pivot towards experiments (and a focus on establishing causation over correlation). We will also consider evolving theoretical approaches, from a focus on the role of partisanship to rational choice theories of behavior to a focus on the emotional and psychological motivations. No prior statistical training is needed for the course. We will review/discuss common statistical approaches in the class. Assignments will be papers/presentations."

Inspired by the title and impetus of Lorde\u2019s essay, this course seeks to ask what happens when we start seeing the world through unfamiliar, alternative, tools or sensibilities? The main objective of this course is to expose us to alternative sensibilities and ways of thinking offered by voices that experience gender and sexuality beyond Western norms and counter-norms.
