        "course_description": "This summer fabrication program bridges and connects thinking of architecture with making architecture. Students experience in a short timeframe all phases of a complete architectural project; from initial design concepts through development and refinement and including realization as a full-scale construction site. By intertwining thinking and making a process of design from beginning to end, we convey understanding, crucial for designers, that making is a form of thinking. Project sites typically will be located in Boston, either campus or community based. Projects, typically conceived as temporary, will generally be small in size, scale or both. They might include, for example, installations (as within a gallery setting), furniture (including near-furniture or furniture-like elements), or site-specific interventions (either outdoors or within existing structures).
