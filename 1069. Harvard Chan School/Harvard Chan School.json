This survey of statistical causal inference begins with foundational concepts: the potential outcomes framework and counterfactual random variables, graphical modeling frameworks, and common assumptions and strategies for the identification of the causal effects of static and dynamic interventions. Methodological extensions for studying the causal effects of time-varying, longitudinal interventions will be touched upon as well. Further topics to be addressed may include instrumental variables approaches, principal stratification, causal mediation analysis, treatment effect heterogeneity, the causal dose-response curve, and causal survival analysis. This course may also introduce elements of semi-parametric theory necessary for the development of asymptotically efficient estimators of causal effect estimands. Where possible, the role of modern regression (i.e., machine learning) techniques and tools for the practical estimation of causal effect estimands will be emphasized.</p>"

Through interactive sessions combining lectures, discussions, and practice exercises, we aim to cultivate practical knowledge and critical awareness essential to conducting high-quality, ethical, reflexive qualitative research.<br /><br />We begin by exploring the philosophical foundations and key characteristics of the qualitative research paradigm and the value of qualitative methodologies for health research. Throughout the course, we critically reflect on the implications of such foundational philosophical and theoretical positionings for the practice of qualitative research, i.e., for designing, conducting, and evaluating qualitative research projects. For example, recognizing that historical, social, and structural forces shape (all) research processes, we explore: epistemological assumptions concerning what (or whose) knowledge \u2018counts\u2019 as legitimate and how those assumptions shape methodological designs; debates about which criteria can or should be used to establish quality in qualitative research; ethical issues that extend beyond procedural compliance to include context-specific and relational dimensions of research design and fieldwork practices; and reflexive considerations of our public health researcher role(s) and relationships with stakeholders in diverse fields.\u00a0<br /><br />Interactive class sessions and assignments focus equally on developing practical skills for conducting qualitative research, including generating data through interviews, focus groups, observations, and analyzing qualitative data.\u00a0Students will have opportunities to design and plan qualitative studies, conduct and evaluate observations and interviews, critically appraise and debate quality and ethical issues, and practice analyzing qualitative data.

Because this constitutes the vast majority of our exposure time, and concentrations of many indoor pollutants are actually higher indoors than outdoors, it follows logically that indoor environments influence our health. Buildings have the potential for both positive and negative impacts on this indoor exposure, and can mitigate the burden of outdoor pollutants indoors. Over 40 years of research on the indoor environment has yielded many insights into building-related factors that influence health, well-being, and productivity. To meet challenges related to energy and materials, while simultaneously providing healthy indoor environments, buildings must incorporate sustainability criteria into every aspect of design, construction and operation. By definition, green buildings focus on minimizing impacts to the environment through reductions in energy usage, water usage, and minimizing environmental disturbances from the building site. Also by definition, but perhaps less widely recognized, green buildings aim to improve human health through design of healthy indoor environments. This class will cover basic principles of high performance building design, construction and operation, and impacts on indoor environmental quality, including chemical exposures, light, noise and thermal comfort. One class each week will be dedicated to lectures on these topics, with case studies and experiences from building practitioners that have successfully incorporated sustainability features in historic and contemporary structures. We will also have guests from across the university (Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Graduate School of Design, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University Office of Sustainability). The concepts presented in lectures will be reinforced in the second class each week with field trips, advanced modeling seminars and hands-on measurements of indoor environmental parameters.

It generally refers to the ways in which people make sense of environmental contaminants and their potential impacts on health. This course will provide formal definition, as well as quantitative and qualitative measurement tools utilized in this emerging area of study that intersects environmental health with implementation, effectiveness, and dissemination science.&nbsp; Some of the key concepts that will be discussed in this course are risk communication, health literacy, and numeracy. Furthermore, students will learn the principles for how to communicate environmental health science in a way that is equitable, rigorous, and accessible for the public based on principles of EHL.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Through this class, we will explore the subdomains relevant to EHL, including health communication, health literacy, risk communication, and environmental literacy.

We show how these theories and concepts can be applied to explain past events and how by taking into account political and economic constraints, they can be used to design more successful programs and health reforms. We review different empirical methods, including quantitative&#x2F;causal inference and comparative case study methods and use them to test and extend theory. Theories of policy reform are applied to cases such as health sector reform in Brazil, Turkey, Kenya and other countries based on student interests.

Yet, in an increasingly divided world, public health professionals have been confronted with the growing politicization of health policy debates, including ongoing attempts to question or limit the influence of science in government policy making. These challenges have been particularly visible in crisis situations such as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic or the latest hurricanes affecting large numbers of people and communities. The same challenges have affected the design of public health programs towards vulnerable groups such as migrants, women and children in humanitarian situations across the world. To fulfill their role in these politicized environments, public health professionals must develop capabilities to lead constructive dialogues with a wide range of stakeholders while searching for realistic compromises on policy options. Such capabilities involve the ability of building trust in a tense public arena and mitigating adversarial relationships with actors opposed to the proposed policies. Engaging successfully with these counterparts is becoming a critical skill in current and future public health crises.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family:&#39;georgia&#39; , &#39;times new roman&#39; , serif\"> </span><span style=\"color:black;font-family:&#39;georgia&#39; , &#39;times new roman&#39; , serif\">Through an experiential learning approach, the course will present systematic tools and methods to engage in complex negotiations in a proactive, critical, and practical manner.

The study of health systems differs methodologically from the study of population health in important ways. Health systems are large, complex, interactive systems. As such, the methods used for inference and analysis in population health (randomized controlled trials, and observational empirical studies that seek causal inference by seeking to approximate the RCT model) are often \u2013 although not always -- challenging or impossible to apply. Understanding variation in health system performance across countries, regions, and time therefore requires that researchers learn how to apply a range of research methods, often spanning multiple social science disciplines.\u00a0<br/>The first half of the course will introduce the methods for qualitative, comparative analysis of health systems, from research design to fieldwork. The second half of the course will focus on statistical methods, including cross-country regressions, multi-level models, and program evaluations of health system topics. The focus in these sessions will be on how valid empirical designs can be generated and implemented despite the complex nature of health systems.

        "course_description": "<p>A growing number of children and adolescents around the world are subjected to violence, exploitation and other forms of abuse. These harms persist despite the proliferation of international norms and structures designed to protect this population and promote its well-being. In many cases global transformations exacerbate rather than reduce the risks of abuse and increase the protection challenges these risks give rise to. Though each category of child protection deficit has its own characteristics and its attendant normative framework, they all share common and definable elements. These commonalities reflect key structures of the society in which the harms occur: growing income inequality and poverty; natural or man-made disasters of unprecedented destruction; a failure to move beyond concerns relating to basic child survival and attend to core child protection concerns. The study of how societies address their child protection obligations, including the normative framework, advance planning and policy and practice initiatives undertaken, reveals a series of profound and unresolved dilemmas that go to their self-definition as global players. An investigation of the human rights dilemmas that arise in child protection on a global scale presents, in a microcosm, a perspective on the social and political dynamics affecting some of the world&#39;s most vulnerable populations.<br /><br />The perspective of this course is twofold. One focus is on the child protection issues themselves, their genesis and impact. The other is on the human rights strategies and dilemmas relevant to those (at both the individual and societal level) charged with responding to rights violations affecting children and fulfilling public child protection obligations. In the midst of historic technological advances and significant progress in the realm of international human rights, the strategic choices and responsibilities facing leaders and others concerned with child protection are of increasing complexity and scope. Some challenges require long term structural planning and the ability to marshall resources for child protection across agencies and governments. Other challenges require immediate emergency responses that entail diplomatic, logistical and leadership skills. Yet others require multidisciplinary, integrative talents in order to understand and impinge on detrimental contemporary transformations that have aggravated the plight of many of the world&#39;s most vulnerable children. Little work has been carried out systematically in any of these areas, with the result that expertise on the ground is thin and operates in a somewhat evidence-free zone.<br /><br />A key concern of the course will be to integrate legal approaches with those developed in the health and social sciences. A recurring theme will be the evaluation of how international obligations map onto policy outcomes and how human rights mechanisms affect problems facing vulnerable children on the ground. The course will begin with a brief review of the theory and literature relating to child protection and international human rights. It will proceed with an in depth discussion of case studies covering central aspects of child protection, child labor, child trafficking, child soldiering and child persecution. Analytic points will be derived from an investigation of specific problems, the legal frameworks relating to them and the solutions that have been advanced to address them.</p>"

As an introductory level course, it necessarily aims to cover a breadth of topics; it does not, therefore, provide in-depth or advanced coverage of any one aspect of qualitative data collection or analysis.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br /></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This is an online course which includes weekly video lectures, readings and activities (e.g. contributing to discussion boards) to be completed asynchronously. In addition, there are a small number of optional synchronous online discussion sessions. (Asynchronous, written alternatives are available for those who don\u2019t attend.) Work in small groups is a central component of the course. Assessment is based on participation in weekly activities and two assignments to be completed over the course of the semester with support and formative feedback from the teaching team.\u00a0</p>"

We recognize that effective leaders cannot just engage the head (evidence and data). We need to learn how to engage the heart (values and emotions) in order to translate the knowledge into the community, political, or economic power necessary for long-term change.<br/><br/>Whether leading one person or thousands, engaging the heart requires learning the practice of storytelling and narrative that enables the leader to locate important themes, communicate those themes, and creatively live them out in professional and public life.<br/><br/>Narrative Leadership course is designed for public health leaders who are interested in harnessing the power of storytelling to motivate others to join them in action.</p>"

How have federal and state public policies influenced the frequency of hospital mergers, reconfigurations and closures?

We can practice democracy by organizing others to confront major public challenges by enabling muted voices to be heard, values to be translated into action, and political will to be mobilized.<br />Leadership in organizing requires accepting responsibility to enable others to achieve shared purpose in the face of uncertainty. Organizers ask three questions: who are my people, what is our challenge, and how can we turn resources we have into the power we need to meet that challenge. In this module students learn to work as leadership teams to reach out to constituents to design an organizing campaign. Students learn as reflective practitioners of leadership of their campaign: building relationships committed to common purpose; turning values into motivated action through narrative; strategizing to turn resources into the power to achieve outcomes; taking effective action; and structuring leadership collaboratively.\u00a0<br /><br />In Spring 2025, MLD-377M will be offered as a two-week practicum during the Spring 1 Module, with in-person instruction limited to two intensive workshops on the weekends (TBD).

Should these individual preferences always be respected? Are there effective strategies that pursue population health in the face of such conflicts while preserving the individual&#39;s freedom to make unhealthy choices?<br />\u25ba How should responsibility for poor health be assigned, and what are the ethical implications of this assignment for poor health due to health problems due to smoking, obesity, and other unhealthy behavior?

The content of the course is informed by a deep understanding of reflective awareness practices as well as core leadership development theories from adult development, emergent strategy, authentic leadership, adaptive leadership, and teaming. Leadership development often requires the nimble ability to expand or shift one&rsquo;s perceptions of oneself, others, and the world at large. In this course, you will develop an understanding of yourself as a leader; discern your values and purpose as you understand it today; reflect upon your strengths, preferences, growth edges, and limitations; practice skills of listening, dialogue, and connection that often support leaders in working with others; learn practical ways of becoming aware of, accepting, and changing old habits and patterns that do not serve you anymore or that do not serve you in every context; and learn the value of candid feedback and reflection processes.</p>"

The course provides students with an understanding of how specific social policies are linked to health, and critically discusses key methodological approaches to study the impact of specific social policies and welfare state interventions on health and health disparities. By the end of the course, students will be able to (a) critically assess theories and evidence on the impact of welfare state institutions and social policies on health and health disparities; (b) describe the strengths and weaknesses of methodological approaches to assess the causal effect of social policies on health using both state-level and country-level data; and (c) outline a research plan to assess the impact of a specific social policy on health.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family:&#39;georgia&#39; , &#39;times new roman&#39; , serif\"> </span><br /><span style=\"font-family:&#39;georgia&#39; , &#39;times new roman&#39; , serif\"> The course starts with an introduction to how social policy is linked to health, providing a theoretical framework for studying the causal effects of specific policies on health. Following this, the course is organized in sessions, addressing the health effects of a number of broad areas of social policy, such as education; childcare and early childhood; labor and employment; income support; Family and children; unemployment and disability; housing; and cash transfer programmes. The course also covers the impact of recessions and unemployment on health and the protective role of social policies; as well as the link between democracy and health, in the context of relevant policies.</span></p>"

The focus is on the extent to which policies and interventions on the social determinants of health can both improve health and reduce disparities. It considers interventions within the healthcare system, but I emphasize population-based interventions on the social determinants of health in multiple other societal sectors. Attention is also given to the social and political barriers to the development and proliferation of effective interventions to address social disparities in health.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>Health literacy is a powerful tool for health equity. This course focuses primarily on information assessment and health literacy best practice; everyone in public health has a responsibility to ensure that information is accessible, understandable, and usable. You will learn best practices for assessing health (e.g., asthma) and health-related (e.g., housing) information (e.g., print, video, website). You will learn about information assessment tools and how to analyze texts and tasks. After completing the course, you will be able to identify and analyze factors that ease or inhibit reading, comprehension, and use of health and health-related information to accomplish specific tasks and make decisions. Course assignments, discussions, and hands-on sessions will prepare you to a) analyze the strengths and weaknesses of information currently in-use, b) offer recommendations for improvement, and c) contribute to practice implementation and new research.\u00a0In a course-long assignment, you will use information from a community-based or national organization. A final paper will highlight the assessments you use, the findings, and your best practice recommendations for the organization. If of interest, the Professor will provide connections to an organization that will offer their materials for this work, and who would be sent the final paper in return. By the end of this course, you will be able to bring health literacy best practice for information assessment and improvement into any area of public health to advance health equity.\u00a0</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>Health literacy is a powerful tool for health equity. This course focuses primarily on organizational health literacy assessment and best practice; that is, the ways in which organizations can equitably enable individuals to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health and health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others (Healthy People 2030). Of course, organizations that focus on the social and structural determinants of health (e.g., housing, employment) are crucial to this work. Clarity, dignified dialogue, democratization of knowledge, and equitable access to and use of services and resources are health literacy hallmarks. You will learn about the trajectory of the health literacy field and particularly the current focus on policy and practice, especially how organizations can reduce navigation burden (e.g., online, accessing service systems, finding one\u2019s way to and in a physical place). Accordingly, the course focuses on how we can identify and modify structural barriers in health, and health-related, institutions and systems. You will engage in: 1) critical analyses of the literature, 2) examine, critique, and learn to use available measures, 3) consider how to move assessment and practice beyond health(care) alone, and 4) assess the health literacy environment of an organization. If of interest, the Professor will provide connection to an organization that is interested in learning from an assessment, and would be sent the final paper. You will participate in small and large group discussions, hands-on learning sessions, and a variety of written assignments and presentation. \u00a0By the end of the course, you will be able to bring health literacy best practice for organizational assessment and improvement into any area of public health to advance health equity.\u00a0</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>This seminar focuses on the analysis of qualitative data for public health research and practice. The course covers a range of approaches to the analysis of textual data, such as from interview transcripts. The course focuses on reflexive thematic analysis, but also touches upon grounded theory, framework analysis\u00a0and hybrid approaches to qualitative data analysis. Students will learn practical skills, including how to develop a codebook, code data, write memos, generate themes, and build conceptual models. The course also addresses issues of ethics in the conduct of qualitative research as well as team-based and participatory approaches to qualitative data analysis. Class sessions focus on active learning and include lectures, group discussions, opportunities to practice coding and summarizing data, article critiques,\u00a0student presentations, and guest lectures. This course is open to masters and doctoral students who meet the prerequisites. Loaner copies of the required textbook are available for all enrolled students.

The course is predicated on the concept that health and health behavior is shaped by influences at multiple levels, ranging from individual factors to macro-social factors. The course introduces an array of conceptual theories, models, and frameworks across these multiple levels of influence, and examines their role in understanding and improving health &ndash;related behavior and population health outcomes. Class discussion and assignments will enable the learner to understand the value of theory for ethical practice, research design, and intervention development.&nbsp;Critical thinking about strengths and limitations of current trends in theory and conceptual frameworks will be encouraged. This course contributes to the theory requirement for the doctoral program in the SBS field of study and is required for student in Public Health Nutrition. Any students who are interested in understanding how to develop interventions at any level of influence may find this course useful.</p>"

Students will plan pragmatic trials that can be undertaken in the &lsquo;real-world&rsquo; using the Theory of Change (ToC) and PRECIS-2 (Pragmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary) tools to answer their research question. Students will be introduced to study designs commonly used in NIH grants, including: randomized controlled trials (RCT), cluster RCT, stepped wedge, interrupted time series, difference in difference, Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomization Trials (SMART), and mixed methods. They will also explore different questions these study designs can answer, and how to select one to evaluate their intervention.<br /><br />Throughout this interactive course, students will work with their peers to practice justifying methodological considerations, assumptions, benefits, and limitations of developing their trial along the pragmatic/explanatory continuum. By the end of the course, students will demonstrate skills to write a research proposal&mdash;similar to a protocol paper&mdash;to guide the testing of their intervention.<br />SBS 523 is a required course for PHS students in the Social and Behavioral Sciences Department.<br /><br />While the course will enable students to understand the practical applications of designing an intervention evaluation, the course will not cover:</p><p>Statistical design and analysis, sample size, or power calculations</p><p>Cost effectiveness assessments</p><p>Dissemination of interventions</p><p>&nbsp;<br />Students interested in learning these topics will be directed to other courses at HSPH and Harvard.</p>"
