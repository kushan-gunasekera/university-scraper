In this course, we\u2019ll learn how to think with food. This means we\u2019ll consider how it creates identities and communities, how it exerts power and signifies privilege, and how it marks commonalities and differences, all by working with literary and film texts treating the discrete and intermingling food cultures that characterize our world and our lives here in San Diego. By acquiring a critical vocabulary to analyze food as a text, students will recognize intersections between social class, ethnic identity, and gender that provide an essential foundation for social justice-focused endeavors."

We will investigate ethical and political questions about food such as: Should we eat meat? What should we make of the claims that people are responsible for disordered eating (of the kind e.g. that might lead to obesity or anorexia)? How does gender intersect with these issues? Do we have a duty to relieve hunger? If so how demanding is it and what grounds it? We will also address questions about the epistemology of food such as: What can we learn from others about taste? Is there expertise when it comes to flavor judgments? Are judgments about the flavor and quality of food and drink ever objective? How can we know? We will also think about the philosophy of science: Is blind tasting reliable? Is it the best way to judge wine quality? We will investigate aesthetic questions about food and drink: Is there an art form of food? Can food be expressive? Can it be representational? Can food and drink be beautiful? Readings will come from both classic and contemporary writings about food and eating. And there will be a number of in-class food-related activities that we will use to spark insights, foster discussion, and anchor our thoughts. Cross-listed with PHIL 118."

When architecture no longer operates in a direct, unmediated relationship between individuals, it meets economic forces and the pressures of the market. The course illustrates the cycle of creative destruction that characterizes the spread of capitalism, tuning into the architectural opportunities that occur periodically in each step capital takes backward before taking two steps forward."

By decolonization we refer to the historical liberation movements around the world, and the indigenous peoples\u2019 struggle for the recognition of their sovereignty over land, as well as the intellectual experiences that counter, or diverge from, European hegemony. Focusing on the years since 1945, this course surveys the architecture profession\u2019s intersections with military logistics, total war, environmental control, infrastructure systems, and monetary, cultural or philanthropic institutions that either violently suppressed insurgencies and liberation movements around the world, or help recolonized the global South. Extending into the post-colonial period, the course will also examine Third World development, international assistance, and humanitarianism especially as they shaped housing and land use policies. While many of our case studies are located in Africa, Middle East and South Asia, the questions of decolonization/marginalization closely relate to our experience in the United States.

In such circumstances: Who must be punished and who may be pardoned? Do vigorous efforts to promote legal accountability jeopardize the emerging and fragile peace? What is the proper role and responsibility of the so-called international community in such circumstances? In this class, we will examine the complementarity and conflict between the often-overlapping demands that nations face in the wake of large-scale human rights abuses, including retribution, reconciliation, restitution, memory, and other forms of accountability. This will include study of the traditional range of transitional justice tools and interventions that have evolved, including international tribunals from Nuremburg to the ICC, truth commissions, reparations programs, public memorials, vetting and lustration initiatives, and broader institutional reform. Along the way, we will probe the blind spots, assumptions, and limitations of varying transitional justice mechanisms, together with the transitional justice project in general."

Screenings, readings and discusssions demonstrate how films are not neutral in presentation of gender--in neither form nor content. Cinema, using specific techniques to produce a dynamic of power through vision and image, has historically privileged a position of heteronormative male desire. In the studio production portion of the course, these techniques are examined as strategies that can be deconstructed, revised and reimagined in individual projects to challenge and question these dynamics. Along with examples of films that are alternatives to this model, readings and discussions help students understand femininity and gender as constructs, and provide cultural and societal contexts to screened works. Text discussions, screenings and individual art projects delineate the framing of the female gender within a cinematic context\u2014and ultimately, explore the relationship between cinema, subjectivity, identity and the body."

Informed practice in this field begins with an awareness of oneself and one\u2019s relationship to those outside of oneself, as well as of the context in which one brings a project. This course guides students to consider issues in representing the self, the other, and communities with which an author does or doesn\u2019t identify.

Is one side privileged over the other because of the origin story of the boundary? Is that privilege visible or neutralized? Is oppression a necessary condition of boundaries? Where does the boundary end in real space or in imagined identities? How does it change over time? Importantly for this class, how do photographic and literary depictions reflect and influence stasis and change, privilege and oppression, and the very capacity to describe one\u2019s own condition? This class will use literature and lens-based mediums to trace depictions of boundaries and borders, and will provide students the opportunity to both analyze existing representations and create their own. We will initially focus on the U.S./Mexico border on which we live and work, but we will also complicate the notion of the \u201cboundary\u201d by examining borders present in situations that go beyond notions of the nation-state. Students will work on an integrated project that describes the border most relevant to their own identities and imaginations, drawing on resources from the disciplines of literature and photography."

Du Bois\u2019 and Alain Locke\u2019s argument regarding art and propaganda. Next, we look at Pan-African Surrealist practices, try out some of these practices; this phase is guided by questions of identity and exoticisation begged by the Nardal sisters, Suzanne Cesaire, and Egypt\u2019s Art + Liberty group. Third, we ask the question framed by Frederick Douglass and bell hooks regarding why a community might represent itself, and look at and make portraiture informed by examples from multiple 19th-21st century black studios, stars, and collectives. We will work on creative assignments to process and take as canon what historical black diasporic practices have to teach. This is a studio course that relies on your engagement with reading and research. No prior formal experience with photography is necessary, but a willingness to make, critique, and be critiqued is required.

        "course_description": "This course aims to study the history of the country of South Africa with particular attention to both the uniqueness and the commonalities of its colonial history with other settler societies. Unlike other Anglophone settler colonies, South Africa never reached a demographic majority where white settlers became predominant. Instead, European settlers made fragile alliances against the African and Indian populations in their midst, solidifying a specific form of minority settler rule. This rule was crystallized in the near half-century of apartheid, the legal discrimination of the vast majority of the country for the benefit of a select few. Students emerge from this course as better scholars of a different society and of many of the historic pressures and struggles that are part of the history of the United States."

Rather than being a place that is defined by what it is, often Africa is viewed by what it is not, and the term 'Afro-pessimism' has been coined by some to criticize such solely negative depictions of a vast and varied continent. What, then, is 'Africa': a location on a map, a geographical boundary? Who are 'Africans'? What does the idea mean and how is it used? This course draws on literature and popular culture to discuss the very idea of 'Africa' and how the concept has been created, redefined, re-imagined, and (de)constructed in differing times and spaces."

This course looks at three avenues in which the 'normal' has been both created and contested in colonial histories: the body, belonging, and becoming. We read from a variety of disciplines, eras, and locations in order to understand how bodies can be made normal or 'queer.' We also examine how imperial structures of rule impact the daily lived experiences of people as they attempt to find spaces of belonging and potential for becoming part of a larger group. movement. or idea."

Extreme heat in the below-sea level basin is contrasted with snow-capped mountains on the surrounding peaks. Vast, dry, swaths of arid, salty landscapes harbor lush oases of hot springs and isolated populations of desert fish. This unique desert landscape was formed by tectonic processes \u2013 crustal rifting \u2013 and provides the backdrop for two contrasting human interactions with the environment: historic extraction of the natural resources unique to this geologic setting, and its modern-day protective designation as a National Park. How did extraction of metals and borax support settlement in Death Valley? When did the last mine close? How does water, the most fundamental resource required for human survival, influence the landscape and human history of this driest place in the United States? This course explores the interaction between humans and the unique desert environment of Death Valley, CA. We will examine the tectonic processes that produced the modern landscape and climate of Death Valley and how these geologic processes led to the formation of natural resources (metals, borax, gypsum). Surface water and groundwater resources were- and continue to be- an integral component of this desert ecosystem; groundwater feeds hot springs, evaporating rainwater forms salt crystals, and rain events lead to further desert sculpting and disruption to Park infrastructure. This course builds on fundamental principles covered in EOSC 105/110 with an emphasis on the interaction between humans and their environment. A significant amount of time (approximately 5 days) will be spent visiting Death Valley during Spring break, which is a mandatory field trip requirement for this course."

Throughout the course, we will pay close attention to the ways that Buddhist communities have struggled to find a balance between tradition and acculturation. Many times over the course of history, Buddhist traditions have been adopted by converts who have interpreted it in new and distinctive ways, or else brought to new lands by people who have carried it with them from their homeland as a way of preserving their cultural heritage. How does the challenge of translating old forms into a new culture necessitate compromises of architectural style or ritual use? In addition to important temples in Asia, the course will introduce students to thriving Buddhist institutions much closer at hand, and explore diversity issues in relation to the Lao and Japanese Buddhist communities of San Diego."

By decolonization we refer to the historical liberation movements around the world, and the indigenous peoples\u2019 struggle for the recognition of their sovereignty over land, as well as the intellectual experiences that counter, or diverge from, European hegemony. Focusing on the years since 1945, this course surveys the architecture profession\u2019s intersections with military logistics, total war, environmental control, infrastructure systems, and monetary, cultural or philanthropic institutions that either violently suppressed insurgencies and liberation movements around the world, or help recolonized the global South. Extending into the post-colonial period, the course will also examine Third World development, international assistance, and humanitarianism especially as they shaped housing and land use policies. While many of our case studies are located in Africa, Middle East and South Asia, the questions of decolonization/marginalization closely relate to our experience in the United States. Topics include the role the US housing policy played in segregating American cities in twentieth century, and Southern California\u2019s intertwined histories of architectural modernism and settler colonialism.

But there\u2019s a twist: we will develop your ability to do philosophy by working through some of the most interesting philosophical issues raised by food and eating. We will investigate ethical and political questions about food such as: Should we eat meat? What should we make of the claims that people are responsible for disordered eating (of the kind e.g. that might lead to obesity or anorexia)? How does gender intersect with these issues? Do we have a duty to relieve hunger? If so how demanding is it and what grounds it? We will also address questions about the epistemology of food such as: What can we learn from others about taste? Is there expertise when it comes to flavor judgments? Are judgments about the flavor and quality of food and drink ever objective? How can we know? We will also think about the philosophy of science: Is blind tasting reliable? Is it the best way to judge wine quality? We will investigate aesthetic questions about food and drink: Is there an art form of food? Can food be expressive? Can it be representational? Can food and drink be beautiful? Readings will come from both classic and contemporary writings about food and eating. And there will be a number of in-class food-related activities that we will use to spark insights, foster discussion, and anchor our thoughts. Cross-listed as FOOD 118."

Public health ethics is a branch of bioethics that is distinct from biomedical ethics in that the focus of public health ethics is focus on populations. Biomedical ethics, on the other hand, involves the examination of issues that may only directly affect an individual. For example, the right to informed consent to treatment is fundamental to each patient, but whether an individual patient\u2019s rights in this regard are violated does not generally affect others. Inoculation policy, on the other hand, affects a population of patients. The two disciplines overlap, however, because entire populations may be at risk for developing certain diseases such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease, even though individuals are treated on an individual basis. In addition, many of the issues covered in biomedical ethics are relevant to issues in public health, such as research ethics, informed consent, and privacy."

At the same time, stereotyped popular perceptions about the relationship between native peoples and the environment often further these inequalities. Although a global system of indigenous rights has been created in recent decades, its impact has been limited, and serious concerns about its long-term potential remain. Through case studies, an interactive negotiation simulation, and in-class research presentations, we will explore the interplay between indigenous peoples, natural resources, and human rights through a variety of disciplinary lenses."

We explore how these concepts and practices both reflect and inform their historical context, including patronage, technological developments (instruments, printing, and information travel), and venue (church music, court music, salon music, public concerts, and recorded music). As a course situated in humanities study, our inquiry considers how this tradition\u2019s musical practices have historically participated in broader artistic, philosophical, and political discourses of their time, and how they have contributed to the formation of historical metanarratives. In addition to an historical survey, this course also teaches students critical listening skills, inviting them to participate in musical experience as engaged listeners and cultural interpreters of music."

In weekly rehearsals, students will embody playing techniques and performance practices of mariachi or folkl\u00f3rico and study the function and contexts for performance to better understand the intersectionality of arts and culture in Mexico and Southern California. Students will also contextualize mariachi or folkl\u00f3rico within histories of colonization and political oppression and reflect on their own class standing and positions of privilege. The course culminates in a final performance in which all students participate. No experience is required to participate in the folkl\u00f3rico dance, and alternative instruments such as flute, clarinet, saxophone, etc. may be incorporated into the mariachi ensemble upon permission from the instructor. This course fulfills one unit of the core curriculum requirement for Artistic Inquiry and carries the Global Diversity level 1 flag. May be repeated for credit."
