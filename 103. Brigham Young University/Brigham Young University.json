        "course_description": "Non-Fiction Advanced Film Productions (AFPs) are peer-mentoring environments provided by the Media Arts Department and initiated by Media Arts majors. While the student initiating a Non-Fiction AFP assumes the primary responsibility for interacting with the Department, the process is collaborative. These advanced projects are generally culminating experiences at the end of a student's undergraduate work (similar to a senior project). Each Non-Fiction AFP comes with associated coursework, class credit, and departmental supervision. Non-Fiction AFPs also receive a large amount of departmental support, through equipment access and funding.  This class covers Pre-Production."

We will cover a broad range of topics that are central to the field of behavioral ecology, including the economics of behavioral decisions, predator-prey arms races, resource competition, group living, reproductive selection and conflict, parental care, mating systems, social behaviors, cooperation and altruism, and communication.  Each of these topics will be examined from an evolutionary and ecological perspective, with a focus on helping students first to understand the underlying theory and concepts, and second to grasp the research techniques and approaches used to increase knowledge in this field.
