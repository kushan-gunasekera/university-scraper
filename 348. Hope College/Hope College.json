Students will focus on tensions within identity formation in Latin American history linked to the colonial experience and subsequent projects of nationalism, the formation of Latino identity in the United States, the history of Latinos in West Michigan, and understanding their own identity formation as \u201cAmericans\u201d against the backdrop of learning about Latino identities. The ability to value others\u2019 culture necessarily requires a firm understanding of one\u2019s own identity, and the overall goal of the course is to prepare students for roles in a global society by strengthening a sense of their own identity and developing an ability to appreciate the identities of others."

We begin by asking big questions about what peace and justice mean-as abstract concepts and as practical goals for social transformation. We also consider related concepts like freedom, truth, and reconciliation. In doing this, we pay attention to how perspective matters when asking these questions. Who gets to define these concepts? Who has the standing to say what peace and justice look like in the world? This approach requires us to identify and interrogate systems of conflict-on a global level and always connecting the past and the present-including systems of violence, marginalization, and oppression. We do this through several global case studies of injustice, violence, and conflict transformation. In this work, we will consistently ask: How can we-individually and collectively-act as agents of peace and justice in the world, working towards resolving and transforming conflict and moving toward a more sustainable and just peace?"

The prime minister has, in recent memory, had to publicly defend the use of French taxpayer money to host an official visit of the Pope. Around the time of every American presidential inauguration, the French press abounds with articles dissecting the tradition of swearing an oath on the Bible. Manifestly, the U.S. and France have differing conceptions of how religious and political life ought to intersect. But how different are they really? This course explores matters of church and state from a comparative perspective."

Moli\u00e8re, like other writers of genius, manages to speak timelessly of the human condition through the very particular social circumstances his characters inhabit. We read him, then, not simply because he is well known, or because aristocratic life of the 17th century deserves closer attention than other social and historical contexts, but rather because he still illuminates life for us today, nearly 350 years after he wrote. In reading his works we will come to appreciate his insights into human character, while enjoying his prodigal talent for turning a phrase. We will also grow in our abilities to read, write, and speak French, while learning more about the language\u2019s history."

This course focuses on the wide variety of technology used in everyday life. The objective is to develop a familiarity with how various technological devices work, and to explain the basic scientific principles underlying their operation. Topics covered include: the automobile, radio, television, cellphones, microwave ovens, computers, ultrasound, and x-ray imaging. Concepts from basic science are introduced as they appear in the context of technology. Laboratory projects include construction of simple objects such as radios, electric motors, and a musical keyboard."
