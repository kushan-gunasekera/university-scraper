For sections taught for the Calvin Prison Initiative, the social space we will consider is the Richard Handlon Correctional Facility.

As China becomes more and more influential on the global stage, an understanding of Chinese values and culture is increasingly important.

While Enlightenment myths narrate modernity as an escape from faith, this course demonstrates that, in fact, the opposite is true: Christian questions, assumptions, and commitments propelled modern thought. The course examines the Christian intellectual foundations of modernity in key figures such as Descartes, Leibniz, Pascal, Kant, Kierkegaard, and Hegel (as well as their debates with figures like Hume and Nietzsche). Philosophical questions in modernity arose from existential struggles at the intersection of faith and reason including the haunting of doubt, the problem of evil, and the foundations for the good life. Emphasis is placed on the practice of philosophy\u2014e.g., dialogue, charitable interpretation of texts, clear argumentation in writing\u2014and on historically and contextually-sensitive faith-based engagement with philosophical ideas as an ongoing part of a reflective Christian life.  Prerequisite(s): Foundations of Christianity I Core or appropriate transfer credit. In addition,"

On this alternative view, we human beings are first and foremost desiring, yearning, craving, longing, hungering beings. The alternative view has its roots in Saint Augustine who, in the 4th century, famously said, \u201cYou have made us for yourself, O\u00a0God, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.\u201d\u00a0Our hearts are restless.They\u2019re agitated.

Furthermore, we hope our students will develop cultural agility which will allow them to understand when to integrate culturally diverse norms, practices, or perspectives.
