Building on the successes of Black Power Studies scholars, this seminar seeks to resist unduly defensive and siloed forms of scholarly engagement, to openly and critically interrogate Black Power&rsquo;s political and cultural dynamics, social formations, and conceptual contributions to political and social thought across such key concerns as political violence, education, the philosophy of race, cultural politics, gender, political economy, and more. Engaging the work-in-progress of visiting scholars, faculty, and other guests, the seminar will provide an extended opportunity to reflect upon the political and intellectual legacy of Black Power, the place of black radical traditions in academic scholarship, and how historians, theorists, and social scientists might work more collaboratively to pursue the hard questions the movement continues to raise.</p><p>To receive credit for this course students must enroll in part A and part B in the same academic year.</p>"

Afrodescendants have been at the forefront of struggles typically associated with liberal values&mdash;equality, democracy, voting rights&mdash;since the colonial period. But Afrodescendant activists, thinkers, and artists have also articulated alternative visions of freedom and belonging that are frequently sidelined in the dominant narratives about rights and citizenship in Latin America. The seminar is conducted in conjunction with the Sawyer Seminar &ldquo;Afrodescendant Citizenship in Latin America&rdquo; funded by the Mellon Foundation. This will allow us to bring scholars, activists, artists and other practitioners involved in struggles for racial justice in Latin America to our class and our campus.<br />Undergraduate students who wish to take this class should get in touch with the instructors in advance.&nbsp;Students must complete both terms of this course (parts A and B) within the same academic year in order to receive credit.

Treating tourism as an enterprise that trades in everything from sensory fantasies to cheap cosmetic surgeries and pictures of tropical paradise, this course contemplates the role of the imaginary in the political and the political in the imaginary. Through careful analysis of travel journals, audiovisual material and first hand accounts from culture brokers and travelers alike, we&rsquo;ll explore the industry&rsquo;s colonial past in relation to Black, Indigenous and queer people&rsquo;s efforts to bend tourism towards a more libratory future. While geographically situated in Latin America and the Caribbean, the course draws from comparative contexts in continental Africa and the United States to critically analyze tourism in relation to colonialism, the plantation economy, African diasporic kinship and the afterlives of slavery.

The course is framed around three central questions: 1.) How is landscape architecture currently practiced in African countries? (2.) What lessons can we learn from landscape practices in various African societies that can help mitigate the impacts of climate change and social inequities? (3.) As landscape architecture unfolds across the continent in the next 50&ndash;200 years, how can it continue assert its agency in the fight against changing climates and social inequity and claim a central space in the shaping of African cities of the future? Each week we will focus on a different country including South Africa, Botswana, Tanzania, Rwanda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria. In collaboration with several landscape architecture university programs across Africa and including practitioners and academics from across the continent, this seminar will explore what it means to practice and teach landscape architecture in societies in which the profession is nascent or non-existent and speculate on the future of the shaping of landscapes in the Global South.</p>"

The course examines several case studies, which may include Mexico, Cuba, Chile, Nicaragua, the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, and the so-called \"Bolivarian revolution\" of Venezuela.

But what happens when the other, neighbor, or stranger has ancestral (or immediate) connections to the destruction, displacement, and death of your familial, cultural, or religious community? Is love possible or justifiable within this context? The course will explore both the ethics and theological grammar of prayer, piety, and &lsquo;sacred songs&rsquo; in post-Enlightenment Quakerism and the Abrahamic religions to imagine the possible epistemic grounds for contemplative and deliberative human interaction among groups holding competing and colliding conceptions of memory, truth, moral responsibility, and exile/freedom/ fugitivity.

Unlike other species, we are heavily reliant on learning from others to acquire many important aspects of our behavior, and this capacity for cultural transmission has given rise to a second system of inheritance that not only explains much of our contemporary behavior but has driven our species&rsquo; genetic evolution over hundreds of thousands or even millions of years. Humans are products of culture-gene coevolution. In addition to having shaped our species&rsquo; anatomy and physiology, cultural evolution has important implications for understanding human nature, and for tackling basic problems and questions in psychology, economics and anthropology. In this class, we will focus on the origins and evolution of human culture using evidence from archaeology, human evolutionary biology, physical anthropology, and related fields. We will investigate how our hominin ancestors acquired and passed down a wealth of accumulated knowledge, such as technologies for hunting and collecting foodstuffs, the medicinal uses of plants, the control and manipulation of fire, and how to identify a distant group member. How did the accumulation of such information change over time and within different hominin groups (such as Neanderthals)? And how can we use the archaeological record and inferences made from human evolutionary biology to answer these questions?</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>This seminar in social anthropology presents value and the exchange of value as the foundations of economic, social, moral, and political life. The authors we read will argue that the exchange of value(s) between humans creates social solidarity. We are tied to our communities and friends through relationships of debt and expenditure; we give a gift with the expectation of receiving something in return, binding the gift giver and receiver in a social relationship that extends over space and time. For sociologist Marcel Mauss, even gestures of altruism are an attempt to create value and establish (or reinforce) relationships of alliance. We begin the semester with Mauss&rsquo;s bold contention that no gift is given selflessly; we give in order to receive something in return. Mauss&rsquo;s The Gift: Forms and Function of Exchange in Archaic Societies is a foundational text of economic social thought; he and the authors who follow him on the syllabus, foreground how social relationships of all sorts are governed by exchange, including relationships between the state and the pensioned worker (Mauss), between friends (Julian Pitt-Rivers), and between members of a community (Roberto Esposito). We then examine the moral and spiritual side of exchange through a close investigation of sacrifice and expenditure through the works of various philosophers, such as Jacques Derrida and Soren Kierkegaard. Ethnographic forays into value supplement these texts and foreground how notions of exchange, obligation, and expenditure guide religious, economic, and political cosmologies across societies. In the last third of the semester we turn to capitalist commodity production and the reified &ldquo;money-form,&rdquo; which Karl Marx argues are socially alienating and economically exploitative. We reflect on productions of value in the context of globalized capitalism and neoliberalism.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>What does it mean when we speak of &ldquo;political power&rdquo;? We know, from the work of many anthropologists, that power is not a question of the state. The political anthropologist Pierre Clastres wrote about non-state societies with a deep sense of law, tradition, and propriety that actively combat the emergence of a state system. In an age where we feel constantly surveilled, it is clear that power can be invisible, yet palpable; physical force is not necessary to encourage obedience among a population. In other words, power, specifically political power, is quite a complicated manner. At a moment in global history when traditional political paradigms are being increasingly called into question, this seminar asks us to reflect on power and politics from historical and cultural perspectives that broaden our conception of political identity and political participation. By focusing on the themes of sovereignty, hegemony, and resistance, we move away from traditional notions of power as that which is yielded by individual authority figures or state actors&mdash;although, we will certainly spend time reflecting on traditional paradigms of sovereignty. Instead, we contemplate the many shapes political power takes in geographically and ideologically diverse contexts. In doing so, the following questions emerge: Why do so many seem willing to kill and die for political causes? What does it mean to have a political identity? Where is the boundary between complicity and resistance? We will approach these questions through a combination of political theory and ethnography that will place political philosophers in conversation with anthropologists with the aim of elucidating the genealogy of shared preoccupations across the disciplines.</p>"

In the rapidly evolving field of data science, merely creating powerful predictive models is not enough. Efficiently deploying and managing these models in production environments - a practice often referred to as MLOps - has become an essential skill. MLOps bridges the gap between the development of Machine Learning (ML) models and their operation in production settings, combining practices from data science, data engineering and software engineering. This course is built upon the model of balancing conceptual understanding, theoretical knowledge, and hands-on implementation. It introduces students to the iterative process of model development, testing, deployment, monitoring, and updating, ensuring they acquire a strong foundation in MLOps principles.</p>"

This survey of statistical causal inference begins with foundational concepts: the potential outcomes framework and counterfactual random variables, graphical modeling frameworks, and common assumptions and strategies for the identification of the causal effects of static and dynamic interventions. Methodological extensions for studying the causal effects of time-varying, longitudinal interventions will be touched upon as well. Further topics to be addressed may include instrumental variables approaches, principal stratification, causal mediation analysis, treatment effect heterogeneity, the causal dose-response curve, and causal survival analysis. This course may also introduce elements of semi-parametric theory necessary for the development of asymptotically efficient estimators of causal effect estimands. Where possible, the role of modern regression (i.e., machine learning) techniques and tools for the practical estimation of causal effect estimands will be emphasized.</p>"

To understand the impact of cancer genomes on individual proteins, biochemical complexes, or signaling networks, you&rsquo;ll interrogate the functional proteome, and you&rsquo;ll take a step back to understand how the properties of cellular systems might be perturbed in cancer. Deep dive into cancer cells will reveal that even within the same tumor, cells can display startling differences for many features making intratumor heterogeneity a major obstacle toward understanding and treatment of cancers. You will learn about small molecule probes and how they offer a unique opportunity to understand the biological rationale for potential cancer therapeutics, how immune cells employ different cellular and molecular mechanisms to eliminate transformed cells, and you will learn about the rapid pace of cancer drug development highlighting results from recent clinical trials that have led to transformative FDA approvals. The topics are&nbsp;organized into eight modules and led by one faculty member. Faculty joining us this Spring are experts in the various fields and will provide you with an integrated perspective on past, current, and future approaches in cancer biology research.

        "course_description": "<p>Although the gender order of the Byzantine Empire (330&ndash;1453 CE) was largely patriarchal and heteronormative, late antique and Byzantine texts and images regularly reveal complex constructions of gender. Pronounced essentialisms coexisted with beliefs and practices defying simple binaries of male/masculine and female/feminine in often surprising ways. This course zeroes in on the entire spectrum of binary and non-binary conceptualizations, representations, and performances of gender in Byzantium by exploring textual and visual material alongside recent scholarship on gender and sexuality. Topics for discussion include normative concepts and representations of masculinity and femininity; asceticism and the gendered body; emotions and gender; same-sex desire and relationships (homosociality); cross-dressing (trans monks?); intersectionality (gender, race, and class); authorial (cis- and trans-) gender performance; eunuchs (a &quot;third gender&quot;?); incorporeal/genderless angels.</p>"

Beyond the captivating personalities involved, the cultural nexus of Alexandria, the enduring legacy of the Greek language intertwined with indigenous Egyptian traditions, the dynamic Indo-Roman trade commercial relations, and the prolific outputs of agricultural and textile industries collectively render the Egyptian province an unparalleled province in the Roman Imperial tapestry. Through an examination of historical accounts, archaeological discoveries, papyrological insights, and numismatic evidence, this course will delve into the intricate web of social, cultural, and economic contributions that Egypt made, shaping the stability, longevity, and even the cultural fabric of the Roman Empire.</p>"

You will emerge from this course being able to tell <em>aposiopesis</em> from <em>praeteritio</em>, but rather than dry lectures on the history of rhetoric, the approach in lectures and section discussions will be comparative through and through, staging curious conversations between ancient and modern as we examine the paths of words through history. We will consider what makes individual speeches noteworthy in their local, historical contexts, as well as within a wider rhetorical tradition, and we will analyze the role of ideologies of gender, race, class, sexuality, nationality, and religion in the construction of the rhetorical subject. In addition, the classical rhetorical tradition of Greece and Rome will also be compared and contrasted with parallel traditions of classical rhetoric in other cultures. Due attention will be paid to methodological problems in the history of rhetoric, such as sources for speeches, the reconstruction of the context for speeches, and situation criticism. Towards the end of the course we will look at theorizations of digital rhetoric and how AI perturbs the idea of the idea of the rhetorical subject.

        "course_description": "<p>Since at least the nineteenth century, computation and capitalism have co-evolved with each other. In many respects, computers have served the interests of capital, by creating new modes of accumulation and means of automating, managing, and outsourcing labor, as well as new tools for researching, advertising to, and transacting with customers. However, computers have also been described as fundamentally changing or even overcoming capitalism&ndash;both for better and for worse. Theorists have credited computers with eliminating work or turning it into play and transforming market exchanges into gift exchanges. Contemporary platforms and artificial intelligence inspire dreams of &ldquo;fully automated luxury communism&rdquo; and fears that law and contracts are being replaced by code and neo-colonial or neo-feudal forms of coercion.</p><p>In this seminar, we will engage with an outpouring of recent scholarship that attempts to describe and theorize digital capitalism and culture, pairing recent texts with excerpts from canonical works that their authors cite and build upon. In the process, students will gain exposure to key concepts, debates, and methods in the emerging field(s) of critical data studies, new media studies, and platform studies. We will also reflect upon the nature and purpose of theorizing. A series of assignments and workshops over the course of the semester will guide students through the process of identifying a promising research topic, reviewing scholarly literature, articulating an original research question, and writing a review essay or research paper.</p>"

Multilingualism sheds light on different possible combinations of roots and allegiances, historically conditioned and linked to the current sociopolitical contexts. In other words, in this course we study multilingualism as a dynamic and polyphonic form through which literature creatively conjugates different experiences of ethnicity, race, class, gender, and sexuality. Throughout the course, our theoretical readings help us conceptualize the transformations that multilingual texts puts in motion in our understanding of self and community.</p>"

More than teach you how to program in one language, this course teaches you how to program fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately. The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that underlies today&#39;s newer languages, via which you&#39;ll learn not only about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory and all. The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that you&#39;ll understand all the more because of C.

Building on theoretical and historical readings, we will experiment with alternative modes of viewing and presenting the artworks discussed in the seminar, make our own &ldquo;bad&rdquo; artworks, and co-curate a virtual exhibition for the final project.&nbsp;</p>"

And how should we approach formally proving that welfare in Nash equilibria for many games is not &quot;much worse&quot; than in the social optimum? This course explores the application of diverse ideas, techniques, and solution aesthetics from theoretical computer science to derive meaningful new insights into classic economic problems. The three main themes are approximation theorems (including bounding the loss in revenue or welfare due to lack of information, to unpriced externalities, or to restricting the functional form of mechanisms); various notions of complexity (including computational complexity, communication complexity, and machine-learning sample complexity); and cryptographic tools (including cryptographic commitments, multiparty computation, and zero-knowledge proofs). Economic applications mostly include analysis of equilibria, pricing, and mechanism design.&nbsp;No prior knowledge in computer science is required.</p>"

There is enormous cross-national and cross-cultural variation in the length and type of education that children receive. A major goal of this course is to help students understand the effects of such variation on the ways that people think--and feel. A secondary goal is to alert students to the ways in which those effects can be measured and to underline the contribution that different methods--experiments, large-scale surveys, and participant observation--can make to our understanding of such effects.

        "course_description": "<p>The duration of education is a strong predictor of health and longevity, but approximately 1 in 5 children with learning or attention issues have long-lasting negative consequences related to their academic, social, mental health, vocational, economic outcomes. In the US, over 2 million students struggle with specific learning disabilities (SLD), which represents roughly 35% of all students who receive special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Children with a learning disability are less likely to complete high school or enroll in postsecondary educational programs and have a heightened risk for developing mental health problems such as depression or anxiety. Currently, SLDs are primarily identified and addressed within the education system; however, these students also receive care and support outside of school and are members of various community settings. A streamlined approach that informs the coordination of general education, special education, clinical psychology, policymaking, advocacy, caregivers, and health professionals (e.g., pediatricians, speech-and language pathologists) is often absent and hinders the design of preventive approaches, identification strategies, and service implementation. It further leads to a siloed approach for care and policymaking, lack of community supports.<br /><br />The course will provide a broad overview of learning disabilities and differences, including dyslexia, dyscalculia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, developmental language disorder, and autism spectrum disorder, as well as the relevant policies and educational documentation for these learners. It will then cover the professional stakeholders that should be involved in an evidence-based response to a learning difference, and identify their unique knowledge base, toolset, developmental timeline, and communication strategies, both in the educational/professional environment and the community. Finally, we will focus on barriers and challenges faced by children with learning differences in the academic, professional, and community settings. Throughout the course, students will be provided with both research/evidence-based content and case-based learning opportunities, practical examples, and guest speakers drawn from the community. Class activities will include both synchronous and asynchronous learning activities led by the Instructor (Prof. Nadine Gaab), along with breakout sessions overseen by the instructor and/or Teaching Fellows.<br /><br />This course is divided into thirds and will cover: (1) a broad overview of learning disabilities, educational policies, and service documentation; (2) stakeholders in academic and professional settings, including their unique knowledge base, toolset, developmental timeline, and communication strategies, barriers faced by children with learning differences in these settings, existing solutions to these barriers; and (3) stakeholders in community settings, barriers faced by individuals with learners in these settings, existing solutions to these challenges.</p>"

This association of Asians with technology and futurity has been called techno-Orientalism, and this course serves as an introduction to discourses that observe and critique this phenomenon. We will consider techno-Orientalism&rsquo;s correspondences and departures from earlier Orientalism and look at its development from early &lsquo;Yellow Peril&rsquo; narratives to the Cyberpunk era, to its contemporary formulations. We will consider how techno-Orientalism functions within both the US national context and within global relations. How does techno-Orientalism motivate understandings of Asian Americans as partial to STEM fields and industries which play into Model Minority myth? How do techno-Orientalist fears of Asian competition on the international level manifest in violence in the US such as in the recent spate of anti-Asian violence in the wake of COVID? Aside from theoretical readings, the course will include literature, film, and media that situate Asia as a site of global futurity, as well as texts from Asian American authors that subvert and complicate techno-Orientalist tropes and stereotypes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>The study of North America, at its root, is the study of Native America and African America. Typically, scholarship on the first Americans&mdash;and Africans and their descendants&mdash;are studied in isolation. Dominant trends in scholarship, journals, academic disciplines, and university departments tend to reinforce these boundaries. And yet, from the dawn of European colonization to the present day, the worlds of Black and Indigenous peoples have collided in ways that have shaped not only the history of each group, but also, European empires, the United States, and the Atlantic World. The legacy of this past is one that lingers. In this seminar we will study the distinct and shared experiences of people of Indigenous and African descent. Within the broader context of Euro-American expansion, war, colonialism, and global capitalism, we will investigate:The historical relationship of Native peoples to land&mdash;and African-descended peoples to labor. We will then develop a broader perspective on dispossession and slavery by examining the shared experiences of Black and Native peoples. On the one hand, we will study slavery as an institution that included Indigenous Americans, predominantly as slaves, but also, as enslavers. We will also examine land loss as a historical phenomena that impacted Black Indians and Black Americans.The history of alliance and antagonism between Indigenous Americans and African Americans will provide another layer of analysis. It forms yet another dimension of the intersecting and shared experiences of both groups. Sometimes, Black and Indigenous peoples were allies in war and resistance, more generally; in other instances, they were antagonists. For decades, Indigenous Southerners enslaved people of African descent. While studying these contradictory relationships, we will also study the formation of mixed racial categories and identities. In this section of class we will focus on the lives and experiences of Black Indians. Key subjects and themes include: Euro-American imperialism; settler colonialism; dispossession; chattel slavery; (racial) capitalism; the Atlantic World; Indian enslavement and Indian enslavers; race, racism, and the formation of racial categories; the contradictory nature of Black-Indian relationships; Black-Indians and mixed-race identities; American state formation and contemporary state violence; emancipation and sovereignty. Course material will draw from classic and groundbreaking works across several disciplines, including Native American and Indigenous Studies, African American Studies, Black &amp; Native histories; the law. Literature, documentary film, and scholarship on Black-Indian peoples and histories will also afford us new ways of learning the histories and legacies of people of Native and African descent in North America, and occasionally, the wider world.</p>"

The course offers an exploration of the largest ethnic minority in the United States, Hispanic and Latinx communities, in urban areas: from iconic neighborhoods like Pilsen in Chicago, East Los Angeles, Washington Heights in New York City or Little Havana in Miami; transnational regions of the US-M&eacute;xico border like the Rio Grande Valley; the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, to states with the biggest growth in the share of the Latino populations such as South Dakota, Louisiana or Vermont. For this interdisciplinary introductory-level course students will be able to get a general sense of the state and growth of the Latino population, and what this means for the present and future of the United States. In connection with the course&rsquo;s topics, students will examine the topics of urban demographics, economics, culture, education, festivities, gentrification, immigration, democracy, and public policy.

This course takes a broad view of the AI imaginary and its intersections with race, by considering both the influence of popular media and fiction and contemporary issues in AI ethics and development. We will consider how AI narratives have long relied on analogies to enslaved and oppressed populations. We will analyze how antiblackness and techno-Orientalist discourse have shaped and been shaped by technological developments in the field. We will consider how contemporary AI technologies deployed in war, policing and immigration, disproportionately harm people of color both in the US and globally.

With a focus on U.S. military developments in media and technology, we will explore how the perception, registration, and weaponization of bodily difference constitute more quotidian modes of governance and securitization across local and global geographies. Through feminist theorizations of politics, we will chart and interrogate the racist formulations and colonial foundations of &ldquo;human security&rdquo; to challenge the epistemological tenants of violence and safety. Students will not only learn to ask critical questions about the politics of securitization, but will also learn to explore the relationships between gender, race, sex, space, and power more broadly.

Learning outcome for students consists in being capable to apply first principles and simple reductive hypotheses for modeling dynamical behavior of molecular machines, stochastic intracellular networks, and large neural networks. They will also be capable to describe some physical limitations of machine learning approaches using Boolean networks.

In the first hour of each class, we will be doing close readings/literary-critical analyses of an assigned text (see below, &lsquo;Course Schedule&rsquo;, for all the reading material for the semester), with the aim of isolating some aspect of the craft of writing in order to take bearings for your own. We will be looking at technical things such as point of view, free indirect discourse, narration, character, interiority, style, movement, affect, but also at broader issues: metaphysics, politics, inequality, race, colonialism/imperialism, the white gaze. You will not only have read the assigned text with critical rigor but also taken notes of the points you want to raise in class. While I do not expect you to hand in short critical essays on the texts, I will be looking for engaged, alert discussions, so it may help to have something written down to facilitate our conversations. Please note: Reading the assigned text is obligatory. Previous Creative Writing workshop experience is desirable. If you&rsquo;re writing YA fantasy, there are other courses on offer that would be a better fit.<br /><br />In the second half of the class, divided into two equal segments of 55 minutes each, we will be workshopping the writing of two students. To this end, every week two students will hand in something they have written, to the tune of 2,500-5,000 words, to me and to everyone in the group, ideally one week before their turn. At our first meeting, I will circulate a rota for you to put down your names and walk you through the syllabus, the aims and objectives of the course, workshop rules, expectations, requirements etc. For our first workshopping session, two students should hand in work five to seven days before. Our goal is for each of you to have two turns, and approximately 5-10,000 words of your work critiqued, by the time semester ends. Copies of these writing samples will be returned to you at the end of each workshop with comments from me and from everyone in class. Work submitted must be single-sided, double-spaced, paginated and, ideally, bearing a title. It must have your name on it and, on the top right-hand corner of the first page, my name and &lsquo;Advanced Fiction, Fall 2024&rsquo;.</p>"

The word comes from the French verb essai, &ldquo;to attempt,&rdquo; hinting at the provisional or experimental mood of the genre. The conceit of the personal essay is that it captures the individual&rsquo;s act of thinking on the fly, typically in response to a prompt or occasion. The form offers the rare freedom to combine any number of narrative tools, including memoir, reportage, history, political argument, anecdote, and reflection. In this writing workshop, we will read essays beginning with Montaigne, who more or less invented the form, and then on to a varied selection of his descendants, including George Orwell, E.B. White, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Joan Didion, David Foster Wallace and Rebecca Solnit. We will draft and revise essays of our own in a variety of lengths and types including one longer work of ambition. A central aim of the course will be to help you develop a voice on the page and learn how to deploy the first person&mdash;not merely for the purpose of self-expression but as a tool for telling a story, conducting an inquiry or pressing an argument.</p>"

Engaging with recent fictions and memoirs by authors such as Elena Ferrante and Ocean Vuong, with African-American slave narratives, and with materials from the history of alphabet books and children&rsquo;s literature, &ldquo;Literacy Stories&rdquo; investigates the rich, ambivalent ways in which literature has depicted the literacy needed to consume it. Given under the auspices of the English Department and Harvard&rsquo;s Mindich Program for Engaged Scholarship, &ldquo;Literacy Stories&rdquo; also involves collaborations with various community organizations devoted to literacy advocacy and instruction.<br /><br />This class will give us the opportunity to reflect&mdash;something we&rsquo;ll do in part by learning about the many ways of relating to texts that flourish beyond the limits of Harvard Yard&mdash;on the contradictory ways in which we value reading. We&rsquo;ll consider, for example, the friction between solitary and social reading: how the pleasures of this activity lie sometimes with how it separates us from others and sometimes with how it connects us. We will be thinking about literacy&rsquo;s long-standing association with individual self-determination and thinking about how that association is put into question whenever people&rsquo;s reading matter gets weaponized as an instrument of their domination. Literacy, the literary and theoretical texts on the syllabus will alike remind us, has a politics. Learning to be literate often involves experiences of unequal power relations and exclusion. Reading with (rather than &ldquo;to&rdquo; or &ldquo;at&rdquo;) others is an ethical challenge&mdash;one that all humanities concentrators and all students interested in social justice ought to explore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

This examination allows us to scrutinize just over a hundred years of novelistic development and experiment &ndash; from 1813 to 1927, from Jane Austen to Virginia Woolf &ndash; a period that might rightly be considered the high-point of the novel&rsquo;s rise. We will discover that as the novelistic treatment of consciousness changes, so the idea of what a mind (or a self) is, also changes: the form (the means of representation) modifies the content (what is represented). What might seem at first like a fairly small thing &ndash; a question of novelistic technique &ndash; will turn out to have massive and far-reaching consequences for our sense of self.&nbsp;</p>"

The narratives set for translation provide a thematic coherence as we dig into the language of Old English, which is the vernacular used in England from the sixth century until about 1100. Although some of its features remain recognizable today, Old English needs to be learned as a foreign language with its own spelling, pronunciation, syntax, and so on. The term begins with an emphasis on grammar, which will be covered in graduated steps until midterm, after which the readings and translation will take up more of our class time.</p><p><br />The unifying theme of the readings will be remedies to preserve the health of the human body. Old English literature offers an abundance of medical texts, including herbal remedies and magical incantations. Some come from ancient Greek and Latin sources, while others are local folk recipes. Some are fantastical, some are known to be effective, and others clearly rely on the placebo effect. The readings will move from simple prose to intricate poetry. An end-of-term project will assign each student a short Old English magical charm&mdash;think of it as a human utterance charged with power to control nature.

The weekly task of translation will be supplemented by consistent attention to the unique manuscript contexts of Old English literature. Special class sessions will include a visit to the Houghton Library to examine the way early manuscripts were created, and a class visit by a professional calligrapher for a hands-on demonstration of the ancient art of writing with a quill pen and ink. The texts will include selections from a historical chronicle, the OE Genesis with its illustrations, the Exeter Book Riddles, Beowulf, and others. The course will guide students through basic principles of manuscript study, such as how the manuscript folios are made, how scribes prepared them before the first word was inked, and how they were gathered into a finished book. Even though we live in an age when more and more texts are encountered in digital form (you&rsquo;re looking at one right now!), the physical book endures as one of the lasting legacies of the Middle Ages. The course will culminate in a collaborative edition of an Old English text, in which each student will transcribe two folios from a medieval manuscript and turn it, step by step, into a classroom edition.</p>"

To investigate what was novel about novels, we will ponder, for instance, how novels differ from epics or histories or the news in newspapers. That pondering will give us rich new insights into the formal devices that empowered this new kind of&nbsp;fiction&nbsp;as it claimed--unlike its predecessors in the narrative line-- to&nbsp;tell the truth: a claim that would eventually, by the time of Jane Austen, underwrite the novel&rsquo;s emergence as the crucial genre of modern times. At the same time, we will also investigate what this emergence can tell us about modernity itself--about love, sex, and marriage, consumer capitalism, race, and empire. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll cap our reading by pairing Austen&rsquo;s&nbsp;Pride and Prejudice&nbsp;with an extraordinary novel in letters from 1808 (only recently rediscovered, and anonymously published),&nbsp;The Woman of Colour: A Tale.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

Though our emphasis will fall on these works&rsquo; place in the literary culture of Austen&rsquo;s day and on their historical contexts in an era of political, social, and literary revolution, we&rsquo;ll also acknowledge the strong and ardent feelings that Austen&rsquo;s oeuvre continues to arouse today. To that end, we&rsquo;ll do some investigating of the frequently wild world of contemporary Austen fandom and the Austenian tourism, shopping, adaptations, and sequels that nurture it. At the same time, we&rsquo;ll also remember that Austen knew fandom from both sides; part of our work this semester will be to learn about the early-nineteenth-century cultures of literary appreciation in which Austen both enrolled the heroines of her fiction and enrolled herself.</p>"

The novel is therefore the perfect vehicle in which to examine &lsquo;the way we live now,&rsquo; to borrow the famous title of Anthony Trollope&rsquo;s novel inspired by the financial scandals of the 1870s. Can fiction help us to unveil the role of money in our lives? Its significance, how it shapes, corrupts, enhances, and deforms desire and ultimately how we understand the good life and what prevents or allows us to achieve it? Does art and literature suffer or flourish under a society dominated by bourgeois taste? How do we find meaning in a world of fluctuating values and transactional relations? How are age-old philosophical questions about freedom, love, death, inequality, language, and art, get reflected in the literature of this age?

And yet despite the fact that all students write essays, most students rarely study them; bookshops and libraries categorize such work only negatively, by what it is not: &ldquo;non-fiction.&rdquo; At the same time, the essay is at present one of the most productive and fertile of literary forms. It is practiced as memoir, reportage, diary, criticism, and sometimes all four at once. Novels are becoming more essayistic, while essays are borrowing conventions and prestige from fiction. This class will disinter the essay from its comparative academic neglect, and examine the vibrant contemporary borderland between the reported and the invented. We will study the history of the essay, from Montaigne to the present day. Rather than study that history purely chronologically, each class will group several essays from different decades and centuries around common themes: death, detail, sentiment, race, gender, photography, the city, witness, and so on.

We will learn how to read closely, to interpret stories and novels, to figure out what literary works mean and, most importantly, how they embody their meanings in form. We will look at the wide spectrum of effects writers create in their texts. We will also be asking ourselves throughout the semester: How do writers read other writers? What are the technical things they look out for when they are reading? These conversations will, in turn, inform the creative work you generate this semester.<br /><br />This class will be co-taught by two creative writing faculty members, Professors Laura van den Berg and Neel Mukherjee.

What economic and cultural roles do adaptations play in our contemporary media landscape? The final assignment will include the option to create your own adaptation using some of the critical models we have explored. This is a lecture and discussion class accessible to non-concentrators.</p>"

This course functions as an introduction to queer theory as an intellectual tool with which to read texts far removed from the political, cultural, and social discourses from which queer theory emerged. We will ask: what can queer theory offer readers of medieval literature in its explorations of gender, sexuality, race, power, narrative, trauma, and time? We will read a range of queer theorists from foundational works to new thinkers, usually including but not limited to Judith Butler, C. Riley Snorton, Lee Edelman, Eve Sedgwick, Kadji Amin, and Carolyn Dinshaw, alongside a selection of medieval texts from the European middle ages (roughly 500-1500). Texts will be in modern English translation or in Middle English (no experience in Middle English is required; additional support is provided for learning to read Middle English, which is quick to learn and fun). Medieval texts may include Aelred of Rievaulx&rsquo;s Rule of Life for a Recluse, The Book of Margery Kempe, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the poems of Baudri of Bourgeuil and other twelfth century Latin poets of the Loire school, the plays of Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim, The King of Tars, and Roman de Silence. No experience with medieval literature is required. This is a graduate course; applications from senior undergraduates will be considered.</p>"

The EV transition has far-reaching repercussions from emissions to macroeconomic impacts to national security and poses substantial challenges in the rapid development of new supply chains.&nbsp; In this seminar, we will study the intersection of EVs, the energy transition, environmental science, policy, and economics. The current pace of change is dramatic but has roots going back 50 years to early U.S. environmental regulation and efforts to reduce dependency on Middle East oil; auto has been a critical element in trade policy back to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Policy is pivotal today, in the U.S. and overseas, in terms of determining the pace of EV adoption, how supply chains develop, and how fast they evolve.&nbsp; The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) enables faster EV adoption through tax credits for EV production and purchases.&nbsp; Technological progress, especially in battery technology, will be critical in the path forward.&nbsp; We will analyze a range of EV issues including those highlighted above as well as charging, health impacts, equity, and international market differences.&nbsp;</p>"

Guided by an interdisciplinary collection of texts, students will have the opportunity to study folklore from the ground up, not only through an academic lens, but through personal relationships, cultural participation, and inquisitive explorations of local communities. Throughout the semester you will be invited to develop skills in qualitative research, cultural documentation, proposal design, interviewing, and the arts of interpretation as you try your hand at fieldwork and ethnography. By examining folkways, expressive culture, traditions, and performances, and interrogating their import in the daily lives of individual and groups, we will aim to bridge the divide between grand theories and everyday practices, between intellectual debates and lived experiences, between the academic institution and the vernacular world. Ultimately, this course aims to bring &ldquo;the folks&rdquo; themselves into the center of the academic study, discussion, and debate.

We will explore these topics and others as we listen to and read about each of the various kinds of singers on earth, the biology of their sound production and reception, and the ways they attract mates while avoiding becoming meals for eavesdropping predators. We will listen to many different kinds of acoustic signalers across a wide array of acoustic communities in tropical and temperate settings, both terrestrial and aquatic, and we will examine sound spectra on a large screen as we listen and slow down and isolate sounds to help distinguish their parts. Finally, we will consider the biology and evolution of music in humans, considering evidence from brain studies, archaeology and anthropology, and the music of indigenous peoples. We will look at music parallels in different kinds in animals of other species. There will be field trips to listen to and record assemblages of local species.

Controversial and contentious subjects are sought in these writings: the imbalance of power between physician and patient; how different religions frame the genesis and outcome of disease; the role of quackery, avarice, and ego in molding doctors&rsquo; behavior; whether character changes for better or worse when people face their mortality; what is normal and what is abnormal behavior based on culture, neuroscience, and individual versus group norms.

Those gases are changing our climate and thereby endangering human welfare and the earth&rsquo;s ecosystems. To avoid the worst of those consequences requires rapidly decarbonizing the US economy, but that task is massive. In the United States, there is increasing public support for strong action on climate change &ndash; thanks in large part to the youth climate movement of the last few years &ndash; and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provided a big boost to wind and solar generation and to the adoption of electric vehicles. Yet the United States is still not on a path to achieve its 2030 Paris target of an emission reduction of 50%, relative to 2005. Moreover, the war in Ukraine, fluctuating gasoline prices, and resistance to the energy transition in fossil fuel-producing communities create a complicated political landscape. This seminar examines U.S. climate and energy policy from both economic and technological perspectives. The seminar starts with a review of the U.S. energy sector, climate science, and climate economics and policy tools. The seminar then dives into current policy issues, including power sector decarbonization policies, expediting the transition to electric vehicles, the movement by businesses to set net zero targets, the impact of climate change and the energy transition on marginalized communities, the politics of the energy transition, and the role of personal actions. The target audience is students who are committed to making a difference in how the US and the world tackles the challenge of climate change: through policy, through effecting social and political change around climate change, or through inventing or bringing to market the technological breakthroughs that will facilitate the necessary green energy transition.</p>"

Genes provide the basic blueprint for brain architecture, but experiences shape the activity of the genome and thus determine how the circuitry is wired. Significant adversity can derail developmental processes and distort brain maturation, leading to limited economic and social mobility. Exposure to significant adversity early in life, particularly during critical periods of brain development, may increase risk for a host of chronic physical health problems, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and addictive behavior; it can also lead to a variety of mental health problems, including depression and anxiety and characterological problems. Science clearly indicates that the longer we wait to intervene on behalf of such children, the more difficult it becomes to achieve healthy outcomes. This constraint is particularly true for children who sustain the wear and tear of early exposure to so\u2010called &ldquo;toxic stress&rdquo;. In this seminar we will critically examine the range of adverse early experiences that impact children growing up in both low and high resource countries. Key themes include a) the nature of the adversity children are exposed to, b) the timing of the adversity c) the chronicity of the adversity, and d) individual differences (including genetic and environmental factors that may confer protection on children exposed to early adversity). We will pay particular attention to the short\u2010 and long\u2010term outcomes on physical, neurological and psychological health.</p>"

Navarre then baffled expectations by not pressing his military advantage&mdash;he instead journeyed to visit Corisande, his mistress and Montaigne&rsquo;s friend&mdash;even though the resistance theory of Navarre&rsquo;s closest advisor, Philippe du Plessis-Mornay, would have justified a decisive campaign. By withdrawing his army from the field and not further challenging the authority of his cousin, Henri III, Navarre failed to end the Eighth War of Religion, but may thereby have won his crown as Henri IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Did Montaigne persuade Navarre to withdraw? What was his argument? Was Mornay with Navarre and Montaigne that night? What would Mornay have argued? We will learn about the theories of political legitimacy and justified resistance to authority developed by the persecuted Protestants of the day and trace the influence of their ideas about political obligation and religious conscience on some of the major figures in modern political philosophy, from Thomas Hobbes to Immanuel Kant. Students should be prepared to engage both in historical detective work and philosophical reflection.&nbsp;</p>"

In fact, a major debate still rages among biologists as to what species are, and how they evolve from other species. This seminar will cover these issues. Darwin used impeccable logic and convinced his readership by the 1860s that the entire diversity of life could be explained by means of evolution. Yet it&#39;s possible that prior creationist notions of species still prevented even most biologists from accepting Darwin&#39;s ideas about the nature of species. We needed a solid theory of heredity to understand what species are and how they evolve, and indeed it was this problem for evolution that led scientists to seek for and ultimately achieve the discovery of DNA. How has genetics and genome science changed our view of species? From 45,000 years ago, Neanderthals coexisted in Eurasia with modern humans for about 3,000-5,000 years. The latest genomic data show that some admixture took place. So, were we the same species? Or two different species? Does it matter?&nbsp; This seminar provides you with tools to make up your own mind on this.

These shifts have been shaped by, and helped to create the conditions necessary for, the emergence, evolution, and spread of microbial pathogens. Here we introduce students to 10 historic and ongoing pandemics and the pathogens that caused them, using phylogenetics and principles from infectious disease dynamics to show how human civilizations informed the entry and persistence of each pathogen. We will use each session to introduce a different pandemic, tracing the history of human civilization through the lens of the biological, ecological, social, economic, and demographic mechanisms - as well as the stochasticities - leading to the emergence and spread of particular infectious diseases. We will introduce the basic biology, pathology, transmission history of each pathogen as well as the scientific approaches that have led to this understanding, and the ways in which we have fought back using medicine or public health. Finally, we will focus on the future of pandemics - coming on the heels of the COVID-19 crisis - and the demographic, social, and environmental forces facing us in this context in the 21st century.</p>"

This seminar is designed as an experiential learning opportunity, where the act of working on a collaborative build project serves as a dynamic avenue to deeply understand core physics concepts. Students will be organized into small teams of 3-4 members, with each team taking on the challenge of fabricating a full-scale wooden boat from provided plans and instructions.</p><p>By the end of the semester, students will demonstrate the seaworthiness of their vessels by ferrying their team members across the Charles River. This hands-on project not only teaches students the principles of rapid prototyping and construction but also immerses them in the practical application of crucial physics concepts such as buoyancy, displacement, friction, and force vectors. Furthermore, participants will gain direct experience in a variety of shop skills, from the use of basic hand tools to advanced digital fabrication equipment, including laser cutters, CNC routers, and 3D printers.</p><p>This seminar aims to equip students with real-world fabrication skills, fostering an environment where creativity and innovation are at the forefront.

They serve, for example, as predator warnings or mating calls. Humans too, like birds, can produce music. But for effective day to day communication (or, say, to develop a scientific theory, etc.), we need languages with words and sentences, i.e. the kind of languages which is unique to our species. Do all languages, in spite of looking so diverse, share a common structure? For example, in English words fall into categories: cat is a noun, meow is a verb. Do all languages have nouns and verbs? A fairly recent turning point in addressing these fundamental questions has been to view language as a computational device. This is enabling us to build effective models of how languages are structured so as to empower us with the ability to create meaning; which, in turn, is shedding light, more and more, on who we are.

Such a relative abundance of documentation, together with a fertile and complex afterlife in subsequent literature and culture, has led to a number of assumptions about Cicero&rsquo;s &ldquo;character&rdquo; or &ldquo;personality&rdquo;&mdash;the man behind so many eloquent words. Yet a quick look at past reactions reveals just how changeable posterity&rsquo;s judgment of Cicero the man has been: &ldquo;Every one admires the Orator and the Consul; but for my Part, I esteem the Husband and the Father. His private Character, with all the little Weaknesses of Humanity, is as amiable, as the Figure he makes in publick is awful and majestic.&rdquo; (Steele, 1710); &ldquo;the most unstable and timid of all Roman statesmen&rdquo; (Mommsen, 1856); &ldquo;We may say then without discrediting Cicero, that he was not altogether fit for public life&rdquo; (Boissier, 1897); &ldquo;a man of mild temper and of constitutional timidity, but of honest heart and sincere purpose&rdquo; (Strachan-Davidson, 1900); &ldquo;no other antique personality has inspired such venomous dislike&rdquo; (Shackleton Bailey 1971). This seminar offers an in-depth investigation of what it might mean to &ldquo;know Cicero&rdquo; today, some two thousand years after he lived. After an introduction to ancient approaches to biography, it will use selections from the <em>Letters </em>alongside scholarly biographies to explore key phases of Cicero&rsquo;s life in which the most fascinating and vivid glimpses of his personality are on offer. The last sessions will be devoted to contemporary representations of &ldquo;Cicero the man&rdquo; in popular fiction and television. By getting to know Cicero we will consider what his compelling life has to teach us about self-presentation, persuasive speech, and the limits of biography.</span></p>"

Narrative voice is a lively dialogue between the author and the reader as they engage in the experience of determining the value and veracity of the narrative: whose story is it anyway? The writer creates the imaginative universe of character, plot, emotions and ideas&mdash;she seems to be holding all the cards; but it is the reader who rolls the dice as she draws on her human experience and moral values to question the principles and priorities of the storyteller.

Is the right to narrative restricted to those who have suffered the injustices of exclusion? What is my responsibility as a storyteller&mdash;or a reader&mdash;if I am a witness to violence, or an advocate against injustice, but my life-story is one of privilege, protection and security?

And what is the afterlife of the avant-garde? How did its legacy inform aesthetic innovation in a later period? We will try to answer these questions by studying a small set of textual and visual artifacts from the long twentieth century, cutting across different continents and political formations. We will begin with conceptual experiments of the Dada and Suprematist groups and Italian and Russian Futurism and their convoluted relationship with Fascist and Communist ideologies. We contrast these historical examples with later work, like that of Andy Warhol, Nam June Paik, and Joseph Beuys. We will consider cinematic experiments of Dziga Vertov and Jean-Luc Godard, ending with David Lynch&rsquo;s radical displacement of the reigning ideology of Hollywood in his 2001 masterpiece Mulholland Drive.

In this seminar we will read recent work on what one might call &ldquo;applied&rdquo; epistemology, touching on a broad range of contemporary social issues that are, at their core, epistemological issues. We begin by examining two questions in traditional epistemology that have recently skyrocketed to cultural prominence: the question of how to respond to disagreement with people who seem just as smart and well-informed as you are, and the question of whether pointing out factors that influence your beliefs but seem to have nothing to do with their truth should have a debunking effect. We will then use these concepts to explore a smorgasbord of hot topics in contemporary applied epistemology; topics covered include fake news, echo chambers, distrusting scientists, motivated reasoning, epistemic benefits that arise from marginalization, and responsibility for one&rsquo;s own and others&rsquo; ignorance.

In this seminar we will explore some of the world&rsquo;s oldest works of literature, inscribed on clay tablets that were discovered in modern times after having been hidden in the ground for thousands of years. These ancient texts disclose a world of epic heroes, monsters, quests for immortality, divine wrath, and sex and love. In them we find ancient ideas of how the universe came to be and how humans were created. They teach us about history, moral behaviors, and society in antiquity. But more than anything, these works of literature reveal something about human lives that we can still recognize. This seminar offers a highly interactive way of learning about some of the most significant pieces of world literature beyond translation and discussion. We will visit several locations on and off campus, where we will engage in conversation with experts, experience modern adaptations of old narratives, and handle objects that are close to 4000 years old. In doing so, we will understand how these ancient stories are still relevant today.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>This first-year seminar examines the history, culture, and practice of the Japanese tea ceremony (chanoyu) and its reception in the United States and beyond. What began as a ritualized preparation of tea developed into a wide-ranging cultural practice, the study of which opens onto issues of Japanese aesthetics, social history, and philosophy. Common perceptions of chanoyu today, however, are often filtered through the lens of its first systematic presentation in the United States, Okakura Tenshin&rsquo;s Book of Tea, written in Boston in 1906. The seminar introduces students to the rich resources in the Boston area that pertain to this early phase of &ldquo;teaism&rdquo; in America, while exploring modern and contemporary examples of tea related art and architecture in North America and around the world.</p><p>In addition to the seminar meeting, a required practicum in our campus tearoom will be led by a certified instructor every Friday. Over the course of the semester, students will learn how to prepare whisked green tea, keep a tea diary, and design a virtual tearoom. Training in chanoyu involves not only the preparation of tea, but physical and mental discipline incorporating movement, gesture, and aesthetic judgement. The goal of this somatic learning is to link forms of practice to critical and historical study, to challenge ingrained bodily and mental habits, and to reap the intellectual rewards of the collaborative environment of the tearoom. The seminar introduces students to a social practice that encourages focused attention, a heightened awareness of small moments, and interpersonal connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

A visitor had placed a post-it note on the glass that shields the Penacho de Moctezuma, and the note stated the words: &quot;This should be in Mexico.&quot; This headdress, commonly associated with pre-Hispanic Mexico and attributed to the last Aztec emperor, Moctezuma II, has passed through various European hands: first taken as war booty by the Spanish in the 16th century, Austria acquired it from France in 1880. The post-it note prompts crucial questions: Who rightfully owns the penacho? Who has the authority to determine its custody? And who should have access to it and why? These inquiries are central to our exploration in this seminar, which delves into a range of cultural products considered heritage of Latin America. We will embark on a conceptual and methodological journey, examining the complexities of preserving items for posterity and the intricate power dynamics inherent in the establishment of archival preservation spaces. Through this examination, we aim to gain deeper insights into the politics of memory and heritage preservation that shape our understanding of cultural identity and ownership.</p>"

It has radically altered modes of interpersonal engagement, democratized access to tools of mass communication, and changed the role of gatekeepers that traditionally controlled access to music, video, and other media. Given the breadth of its impact, it is not surprising that the Internet has pushed the bounds of legal doctrines that govern speech, privacy, and the creation and exploitation of content. Mass-scale online distribution of copyrighted works tests the limits of legal doctrines developed in an era of physical copies. Age-old tensions between privacy and the right to free expression have been exacerbated in cases where one&rsquo;s right to speak bumps up against the desire of another to keep information private. And, the ability to share&mdash;and, thus, to consume&mdash;extraordinary amounts of personal data has impacted government (which collects and uses data for purposes of law enforcement) and private companies (which collect and use data for purposes of advertising and monetization).

In this seminar, we will delve into this question and what drives community resistance and social movements in the face of frequently daunting odds. We will zero in on community resistance in its many forms when confronting abusive corporations and authoritarian governments often supporting them. Through case studies involving natural gas in Myanmar, gold mining in Papua New Guinea, and chocolate in West Africa, we will discuss both the harms communities experience and how communities can have a seat at the table to demand their rights and take on oppressive systems. We will also look at how North America is implicated in these cases and consider the power dynamics between communities, advocates, businesses, and states that span borders and different cultures. We will also look at ways that communities can build their own power through the solidarity economy and how advocates cannot only combat economic injustice but build their visions of economic justice for the future.</span></p>"

        "course_description": "<p>Debates about when adolescence ends and adulthood begins often lead to judgements about how long youth today are taking to reach adulthood and uncertainties about what it means to become an adult. The transition from adolescence to adulthood is often fraught with anxieties about realizing one&rsquo;s dreams, getting into college, succeeding in the job market, and finding a life partner. Have the definitions and markers of adulthood changed across generations?&nbsp; Should these conceptualizations change or adapt to the times? Are young people today trapped in an extended adolescence? Some experts and the popular press contend that young people today are coddled and more resistant to growing up than were those who came of age a generation or more ago. Conversely, other experts and many young adults today find that growing up is harder&mdash;harder to launch a career, burdened by student loan debt, harder to find a compatible life partner&mdash;in general, harder to achieve the life their parents have. Amid these debates, it is unclear what is meant by adulthood and whether it can or should be defined by the same markers as have been used in the past.&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s young adults are charting their own path&hellip;or are they?&nbsp;</p><p>In this seminar, students will define and redefine adulthood based in multiple contexts, considering catalysts and impediments on the pathway to adulthood. Using a historical lens, we will examine and understand the contexts that elicit longer and shorter pathways to adulthood, including the role of the economic context, educational and occupational opportunities, gender, and the need to co-construct adulthood with others.&nbsp; Whereas societal factors are often considered contextual, this seminar focuses on societies as active agents in shaping adolescents&rsquo; beliefs about adulthood and struggling with and sometimes against adolescents as they navigate their place as adults. This seminar takes a global lens and focuses on the ways in which the transition to adulthood is a dynamic and co-constructed concept and will aid students in developing an integrative understanding on societal needs and pressures and young adults&rsquo; tools in navigating the path to adulthood.</p>"

Why don&rsquo;t politicians provide the policies and public services people seem to want?

This interactive seminar will address these and other questions by examining the political, social, material and cultural history of oil. Given the centrality of oil to modern life, control over this prized resource has resulted in a complex and often violent history. We will thus look at the ways in which the political economy of oil has shaped the rise and fall of empires, the fate of nation-states, the making of the economy, the nature of class, gender, and racial discrimination, and the production of historical knowledge and the built urban environment. By moving between primary source documents and films, novels, multi-disciplinary scholarly analyses, in-class discussions, and written assignments, students will learn to be principal investigators and thereby sharpen their own critical interpretive abilities.

To what extent, if any, did negotiations between the combatants end the fighting? We will see that while the expectations and aims of the combatants are typically deeply opposed at the beginning of a war, over time they often converge toward an agreement to stop fighting.

It appears that, without the &ldquo;sense of an ending,&rdquo; not only artistic production, but also individual and social lives cannot be made coherent and effective. Fantasizing about the apocalypse is something that many people in the US and almost everywhere else in the world used to do on a daily basis either by watching their favorite shows on TV, by playing videogames, or by listening to political speeches. Of course, in 2020 all this has become not only fictional anymore due to the tragedies and disruptions brought about in our daily life by the Covid-19 pandemic: we truly live in a post-apocalyptic world. But it is worth remembering that many experienced such a condition even before 2020 and we can learn from their reflections and imaginations how to live the apocalypse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This course will start from these observations to ask why imagining the end is so pervasive in contemporary cultures, what ethical choices are put in front of us &ldquo;at the end of the world as we know it&rdquo;, and how we can analyze critically where apocalyptic images are coming from and how they are used in contemporary conversations.</p><p>Imaginations of the end have their roots in a literary genre that is often called &ldquo;apocalyptic&rdquo; and has been alive and productive since antiquity. The course will look at this historical trajectory, but most of the work will be focused on contemporary cultural products, such as movies, short stories, songs, art, comic books, videogames, and so on. The products of writers, filmmakers, and artists will be analyzed and observed as thought experiments and &ldquo;revelations&rdquo; about the incoming end and its aftermath. Much of this work will be carried out in collaboration with the Harvard Art Museum and through the participation of writers and artists as guest lecturers and interviewees. &nbsp;</p><p>Thus, students will be asked to observe how thinking about a catastrophic future is actually a means to reflect about the present, by identifying whether humans are doing something wrong, whether they have any chance to correct their mistakes, or what strategies can be deployed to face with resilience the aftermath of the end. In this perspective, for instance, God, aliens, or meteorites are metaphors representing our powerlessness, while sins, zombies, or climate change are wake up calls for humankind. &ldquo;Prophets of doom&rdquo; can be channels of liberating and progressive energy, but can also become instruments to set up for destruction people who look and act differently. Apocalyptic scenarios almost always distinguish humankind in the two opposed camps of those who are saved and those who are condemned, but in more modern apocalypses the Enemy (like the biblical Antichrist) looks more and more undistinguishable from our own selves.</p><p>Ultimately, the course will ask you to reflect about your own fantasy of the end and write (or photograph, or sing) it.</p>"

Does &quot;security&quot; make us vigilant or negligent, confident or complacent? Does it promote more fear than it assuages? Is a security purchased with freedom or human rights morally viable?

As our communication becomes ever more digital&mdash; and, therefore, simultaneously more ephemeral and more durable&mdash;the attitudes and tools we have for preserving our culture have come to seem less apt than they may have seemed as recently as a generation ago. This course examines how texts have been transmitted from the past to the present, and how we can plan for their survival into the future. We will examine what makes texts durable by considering especially the media by which they are transmitted, the changing cultural attitudes toward their content, and the institutions by which they are preserved. The European Renaissance will provide a central case study. During this period scholars became aware of the loss of ancient texts and strove to recover and restore them insofar as possible. These interests prompted new developments in scholarly conservation techniques which we still value today (philology, libraries, and museums) but also the creation and transmission of new errors, ranging from well-intentioned but overzealous corrections and &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; to outright forgeries. What can the Renaissance teach us about how to engage productively with these problems, both as the source of our current attitudes toward preservation and loss, and as a case study of another culture dealing with anxiety over preservation and loss? Ultimately, we hope that students will be able to think productively about preservation in the past and in the future, while recognizing that all preservation inherently involves some kind of transformation.</p>"

First, we ask: What is morality? Many people believe that morality descends from above, as divine commands or as abstract, timeless principles akin to mathematical truths. Here we take an empirical approach to morality, viewing it as a natural phenomenon that rises up from below&mdash;born of the strategic interactions among lifeforms and societies struggling to exist. Next, we take a scientifically informed look at the foundational questions of moral and political philosophy. Many people believe that the &ldquo;is&rdquo; of scientific knowledge has nothing to do with the fundamental &ldquo;oughts&rdquo; of morality, that science and morality exist in separate realms (and belong in separate courses). Here we challenge this assumption, asking whether our scientific self-knowledge can, and should, change our views about what&rsquo;s right and wrong and how a society should be organized. Finally, we consider the distinctive moral challenges posed by what may be the next stage in Earth&rsquo;s evolutionary history: the rise of artificial intelligence. Many people believe that there is and always will be a fundamental division between human minds and machines. Here we challenge this assumption, going beyond the tropes of science fiction and drawing instead on the latest advances in cognitive neuroscience and neurally inspired artificial intelligence. Our conclusions will have implications for moral challenges of the near and more distant future: Can self-driving cars, military drones, and life-like robots be programmed to behave morally? Will artificial intelligence displace human labor? If so, how can our societies adapt? Could machines displace humans entirely? If so, how can we stay in control? If machines do take over, will they be our conquerors or our children? Across diverse topics, this course explores the implications of a single idea: that the wonder we see around us, and ahead of us, is the product of competition and cooperation at increasing levels of complexity.</p>"

In the current century, heart diseases will be the leading global cause of death, and the majority of those heart disease deaths will actually occur in the developing world. The epidemic of heart disease has been driven by many social, economic and technological events. Some of these events have been dramatically detrimental to human health, such as the accidental invention of the American cigarette by a slave in North Carolina in the 19th Century&mdash;an invention that is projected to kill one billion people between 2000 and 2100. Other events, such as advances in public health and safety, have been beneficial by extending lifespan and preventing early death, but they have also allowed age-related heart diseases to explode. Technological advances have improved our economic productivity but also led to changes in our lifestyles that promote heart diseases. In this course, we will consider the complex relationship of health and society by examining the epidemic in common heart diseases. We will explore how major lifestyle factors such as tobacco, alcohol, exercise and diet affect health, and we will also consider how economics and politics powerfully influence health.

How can interpreting an individual believer&rsquo;s engagement with the arts help us see &ldquo;religion&rdquo; in a new light?</p><p>Using Islam as a case study, this course explores the multifaceted relationship between religion and the arts. We will learn to listen, see, and experience Islam by studying Muslims&rsquo; engagement with the literary arts (scriptures, panegyrics, love lyrics, epic romances, folk songs, and folk tales), as well as sound and visual arts (Quran and poetic recitations, music, dance, drama, architecture, calligraphy, and miniature painting). &nbsp;Weaving the voices of poets, writers and musicians with those of clerics, mystics and politicians, we will consider how the arts create a religious tradition and shape the worldviews of Muslim communities around the world.</p><p>Given the cultural diversity of Muslim societies, the course draws on material from regions beyond the Middle East, particularly sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia. This course assumes no prior knowledge of Islam.</p>"

Why does the Mexico-U.S. border continue to be a space of discussion and controversy? In the twenty-first century, as nations across the world militarize or rebuild their borders, the U.S.-Mexico border serves as a vital case study to understand the ongoing trend of tightening national borders&mdash;it also allows us to better understand our own history, politics, and how we shape our view of the world. In addition to examining the creation of the U.S.-Mexico border in 1848 to the present, this course examines how ideas of public health have historically been used in border debates. For many, the border served (and serves) as a protective barrier from poverty, violence, and, especially, disease. By the early twentieth century many Mexican bodies were perceived as &ldquo;alien,&rdquo; &ldquo;illegal,&rdquo; and in need of patrolling. Yet these descriptions were also used by Mexican politicians to describe and isolate Indigenous groups and the Chinese within Mexico. By examining, for example, border ecological disasters, response to epidemics and a pandemic, and how ideas of race and health played out within Mexico and the U.S. we can better understand borders in general.</p>"

To answer these questions, we will study the many different material forms in which texts in Western culture have been inscribed&mdash;from tablets to e-books&mdash;and the technologies that have enabled their creation. We will also explore every possible aspect of the object we know as a &ldquo;book,&rdquo; from the title page to the index, and from the layout of a page to the use of illustrations and decorations&mdash;and what each of these features of the book can tell us about its historical role, how readers have used the book, and what it has meant to them.

        "course_description": "<p><strong>How and why does the U.S. Civil War continue to shape national politics, laws, literature, and culture---especially in relation to our understanding of race, freedom, and equality?</strong></p><p>Most of us were taught that the Civil War between the Confederacy and the Union was fought on battlefields chiefly in the American South between the years of 1861-1865. In this narrative, the North won and the South lost. But what if the issues that resulted in such devastating bloodshed were never resolved? What if the war never ended? This course demonstrates the ways in which the United States is still fighting the Civil War, arguably THE defining event in U.S. history.&nbsp;In each class, we connect current events to readings and themes in the course, highlighting how and why the war is still being fought. From Nat Turner&rsquo;s slave rebellion in 1831 to the recent riot (or battle) in Charlottesville, we trace how and why the South was in certain respects the victor, even though the Confederacy was destroyed and the Constitution amended. We explore the different kinds of war&mdash;ideological, political, cultural, military, and para-military&mdash;that placed the unfreedom of blacks&mdash;as slaves, serfs, and prisoners&mdash;at the center of larger conflicts over federal versus state and local rule, welfare, globalization, and free trade. We analyze the Civil War in literature, art, politics, photography, prints, film, music, poetry, speeches, and history, while also discovering how these cultural forms worked to shape our memory of the event itself. By the end of the course, we will be able to show how and why contemporary U.S. debates are rooted in this defining narrative, and we will better understand the dilemmas the nation faces today.</p>"

When they failed, border peoples incorporated China into their own inland empires: the Mongols in the 13th century and Manchus in the 17th.&nbsp; On the other hand, it has been a history of economic and cultural relations, in which China absorbed foreign models (Buddhism from India in the 3rd century; the sovereign nation-state system from the West in the 19th century; and both industrial capitalism and Stalinist socialism in the 20th century),&nbsp; defended trade by land along the Eurasian silk routes and by sea with South and Southeast Asia, and put itself forward as a model state for others in East Asia and beyond.</p><p>The course will enable students to debate how the choices China has made in the past bear on the challenges it faces today, when a modern &ldquo;China model,&rdquo; with ancient roots, competes with the United States for global leadership.</p><p>The course is taught with multiple pedagogies.&nbsp; By shifting lecture to on-line modules that include &ldquo;field trips&rdquo; to sites in China, class time is focused on active, participant-centered learning around major texts, works of art, and contemporary case studies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Class preparation and attendance are mandatory.&nbsp; Assignments include responses to online modules, weekly sections, a midterm examination, and a final group project.</p>"

We plan to explore options for a zero carbon future energy system including the challenges involved in implementing the necessary transition. If we fail to abandon our dependence on fossil fuels - and the time scale over which we must do so to realize even the minimal objectives outlined in the recent Paris climate accord is as brief as a couple of decades or even less &ndash; might we need to explore possibilities for geoengineering, for purposeful intervention in the global climate system?

The study of the archaeology, artistic media, cosmovision, capital cities, human sacrifice and the religious devotions of ancient Mesoamerica illuminate the Day of the Dead and Virgin of Guadalupe phenomena today. Hands-on work with objects at the Peabody Museum aids in examining new concepts of race, nation and the persistence of Moctezuma&#39;s Mexico in Latino identities in the Mexico-US Borderlands.

Through direct purchase and through the collecting activity of numerous alumnae/i, we began collecting all sorts of texts and artifacts generated by the medieval world of Arabic, Greek, and Latin civilizations. The things that arrived in Harvard&rsquo;s collections came in many forms, ranging from great architectural monuments and motifs to little stuff such as belt buckles, pilgrims&rsquo; flasks, and fragments of pottery.<br />&nbsp;<br />Why did we want medieval stuff? And what have we since learned about the world from which it came? This is a course about objects and their meaning, focusing on the objects in Harvard&rsquo;s collections that derive from western Eurasia and North Africa between the fall of the Roman Empire to the eve of contact with the New World. The five modules in the course begin by introducing you to five objects&mdash;things, images, texts&mdash;in Harvard&rsquo;s collections. Each of these objects lies on the edges of canonical knowledge and therefore pose mysteries and invite questions. Our own exploration starts with the context of the object&rsquo;s acquisition and briefly explores what was happening in the world at the moment of its arrival. What did the acquisition of the medieval mean a hundred years ago? From there, we plunge into the past to explore the objects in their own context, working to grasp technologies, economies, social relations, and beliefs. Among other topics, we explore how medieval people imagined saints, miracles and witchcraft, as well as hell and other nasty regions of the afterworld. We explore trade networks and power structures and beliefs about others. We see how medieval peoples mapped visions of their own world, and work our way into the deep inner structures of their cognition, such as their understandings of time and calendar. Starting from the particular and moving to the general, lectures and assignments seek to frame the cultural context of each object and model how students can develop the skills they need to unpack and explain the unfamiliar. A major course-long assignment will invite students to make their own discoveries in Harvard&rsquo;s collections and elsewhere and to curate their own virtual gallery of objects that engages with the medieval world. The semester ends with a concrete proposal to the museum regarding areas of the collection that we need to build up to promote the concerns and issues of our own day.&nbsp;</p>"

First, it&rsquo;s a crossroads of disciplines. Climate change affects science, society, culture, government policy, biodiversity, and environmental justice. To understand it is inherently interdisciplinary and requires standing at the crossroads of several approaches. Second, humanity itself is at a new crossroads. Because global climate is shifting rapidly, this prompts new views of humans in geologic time, as well as new thinking in economics, law, finance, and science.<br /><br />Climate change isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;global warming.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s an alteration of conditions on Earth to which all creatures and societies are adjusting. What is the science of climate change? Why can&rsquo;t understanding and dealing with climate change be confined to science?<br /><br />Through materials and assignments that address quantitative understanding and qualitative judgment, you&rsquo;ll learn why it&rsquo;s unwise to seal the interrelated issues of climate change in separate disciplines; conversely, why it&rsquo;s necessary to use separate disciplines to acquire the knowledge and applications needed to formulate policy and actions.

Technological innovation is all around us, and new&nbsp;possibilities in fields like artificial intelligence, genome-editing and geoengineering not&nbsp;only reallocate power, but might transform human life itself considerably, to the point&nbsp;of modifying the essence of what it is to be human.&nbsp;While ethical considerations enter&nbsp;prominently, the philosophy of technology is broader than its ethics. It aims to interpret&nbsp;and critically assess the role of technology for human life and guide us to a more&nbsp;thoughtful integration of technology in our individual lives and in public decision&nbsp;making. This course aims to teach you to do just that, starting with basic stances and&nbsp;key figures in the field and then progressing towards a number of challenges around&nbsp;specific types of technology as they arise for the 21st century. At times it is tech optimism&nbsp;that dominates these debates (sometimes even techno-boosterism that sees technology&nbsp;as key to heaven on earth), at other times it is more low-spirited attitudes from&nbsp;Romantic uneasiness to doom-and-gloom Luddism and technology-bashing. A closer&nbsp;look at these attitudes &ndash; alongside reflection on how technology and power are&nbsp;intertwined &ndash; will help generate a more skeptical attitude towards all of them and&nbsp;contribute to more level-headed debates, which are badly needed.&nbsp;</p>"

Both are artful expressions of communal, traditional culture in everyday life! Beyond the walls of museum galleries, creative expression exists all around us in surprising<br />forms, shaped through individual and communal creation. In this course, you will learn to recognize and evaluate diverse expressions of traditional culture, from Harvard Lore to annual family traditions, to community festivals, to social media culture. Course readings introduce you<br />to a variety of traditional texts (forms of expressive traditional culture); contexts (the sites and occasions where traditional expressive culture is performed); and textures (aesthetics, or the culturally informed, group-based parameters that shape traditional culture). You will complete<br />small collection projects to look for and describe expressive traditions, and these exercises will culminate in your own capstone ethnographic project in which you document, analyze, and creatively present an expressive tradition of your choice. The course prepares you to see artful<br />expressivity in everyday life, rethinking the universality of concepts often attached to creative expression such as &lsquo;beauty,&rsquo; &lsquo;art,&rsquo; &lsquo;individual genius,&rsquo; &lsquo;progress,&rsquo; &lsquo;ownership,&rsquo; &lsquo;expertise,&rsquo; &lsquo;agency,&rsquo; and even time itself.</p>"

By analyzing texts from Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm&rsquo;s influential collection Children&rsquo;s and Household Tales, comparing them to similar fairy tales from other cultures, and examining the contributions of visual artists to these transformations, we will explore pressing human questions such as love and desire, infertility and procreation, trust and betrayal, hunger and abundance, parental guidance and child abuse, and the discriminatory practices embedded in these texts, and demonstrate the universality and particularity of such stories and their impact on society at large. By the end of this course, you will have a thorough understanding of fairy tale archetypes and plot structures, various scholarly perspectives on these tales, an awareness of intertextuality, and the ability to analyze stories with multiple layers of meaning. You will also be able to reassess how you and those around you tell stories.&nbsp;</p>"

Drawing from Marxist theories of materialist history as much as theological traditions of Jewish messianism, Benjamin&rsquo;s work addresses topics ranging from the violent effects of industrial capitalism on lived experience; to the ascendency of image culture via photography and film; to the social tremors that led to the rise of fascism. Through close readings of Benjamin&rsquo;s most famous texts, and alongside reflections on the historical context in which he worked, this course will map the broad field encompassed by Benjaminian thought, as we seek to uncover a deeper unity in the diversity of the topics engaged by his philosophy.

Greek 112a and 112b may be taken independently. (Both semesters are required for graduate students in Classical Philology.) The class prepares students to discuss ancient Greek literature in its historical and cultural context with chronology, genre, theme, performance, and reception context as organizational frameworks. Through prepared translation and analysis of assigned text, and discussions of assigned scholarly works, students will improve their reading fluency and enhance their ability to read, interpret, and teach a range of Greek texts. Greek 112a focuses on Greek poetry from the archaic into the classical period. Greek 112b focuses on prose literature from the classical, Hellenistic, and imperial periods. This course is designed for advanced readers of ancient Greek with previous experience with a range of Greek authors and genres.</p>"

We will consider money as an object of aesthetic appreciation, an ethical problem, an architect of social relations, an environmental disruptor, a tool of political resistance, and much more. How has coinage design functioned as a political, religious, and cultural symbol? Is money a measure of value, and how does it align with other potential values, such as religious, moral, and aesthetic ones? Is it ethically neutral or an instrument of moral vice or virtue? What were the debates surrounding the rise of paper money? How has money been used as a tool of revolutionary movements and political resistance? Does money get recycled, and what is the environmental cost of different money forms today? What are the links between art, literature, theater, cinema, and money?

On the one hand, we will consider the colonial origins of many pigments (e.g., cochineal red; indigo blue) and their impact on the European artistic production and decorative arts. On the other hand, we will discuss the ways in which the aesthetic uses of color helped sustain a political system and social and cultural hierarchies in the era of colonization. What were the new meanings and effects of color as the physical product and sign of growing global trade networks, colonial and slave economies, and expanding empires? How were the artistic debates centered around color affected by, and in turn, how they affected what may be called the colonial economy of pigments? What role did the new pigments and colored materials play in the construction of the emergent conceptions of race and gender?</p><p>Our discussion will be based on readings drawn from the most recent scholarship and in analysis and hands-on experience of art objects in the Harvard Art Museums. Moreover, students will be involved in a pigment workshop based in the material resources of the museum. An excursion to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York is also planned.</p>"

They will actively research topics such as systems ecology, extractive geographies, life cycle material modeling, circular design, pervasive connectivity, biomaterials, adaptive reuse, indigenous and traditional craftsmanship, healthy materials, social equity, and other pertinent subjects. Additionally, students will acquire advanced proficiency in utilizing software tools and innovate new fabrication processes to address material flows around and through buildings effectively.</p><p>Beyond theoretical knowledge, this course offers a unique opportunity for students to actively confront the environmental and human impacts associated with material management in the built environment. Through hands-on, design-led learning experiences, students will be encouraged to tackle these challenges by designing and building real-world prototypes through semester-long team projects that utilize industry and Harvard University material resources. Ultimately, students will develop a robust research framework to investigate, deconstruct, and invent new material life cycle design strategies that critically engage pluralistic design solutions toward a new regenerative architecture.</p>"

We will examine the various ways in which Greek artists represented the body, and consider how forms of identity, especially gender difference, were imagined and articulated through artistic practices. But we will also interrogate the ways in which works of art themselves &mdash; statues, paintings, vessels &mdash; could function like bodies or in place of bodies, expanding the notion of what it meant to be a living person.

Within the framework of gene-culture coevolution, we will explore the nature of friendship and the volition that characterizes it. What role does biology play in establishing and maintaining friendships? How does gene-culture evolution shape friendship behaviors? How do our relationships affect our physical and mental health? What purposes do group identities serve and what makes them helpful or harmful? What are social emotions and why do we experience them? How are technology and artificial intelligence impacting human relationships? How do local, national, and global disasters interact with our evolved capacities for close social affiliation?

This course analyzes key texts of the book of Psalms that, in extolling the qualities of the Israelite deity, reveal different aspects of his character: his nature as a storm god and warrior; his eventual preference for the city of Jerusalem; his adoption of the traits of a sun god, connected to the domains of law and justice; and his emergence as the head of the heavenly council and creator of the world. The course presumes basic proficiency with Biblical Hebrew.</p>"

The third unit focuses on the way the CIA has been represented on page and screen, and the relationship of these fictions to the actual operations of the agency, including political subversion, covert action, and targeted assassinations. In doing so we will also consider how writers like Graham Greene, Lauren Wilkinson, and Mohsin Hamid have challenged the conventions of the spy thriller genre. In the final unit we will explore the role of espionage in the &quot;War on Terror,&quot; and consider the way espionage fiction, including&nbsp;<em>Homeland</em>&nbsp;and<em>&nbsp;Zero Dark Thirty</em>&nbsp;grappled with ethical questions surrounding spying, terrorism, and torture.</p>"

What countries, leaders, and popular audiences around the world have latched on to these images, and to what end? Have they launched revolutions or upheld hierarchies? Considering these questions, we will examine British performing and visual arts, literature, sports, education, and fashion as channels of power - deployed at times by British elites and politicians - and chart the relationship between this nation&rsquo;s creative ascendence and its imperial decline.</p>"

To help us better understand why, this course traces the rise of mass consumer culture in modern Europe from the 19th century industrial revolution to the late twentieth century. Over the semester we will seek to answer the following questions: How has the meaning of buying and possessing stuff changed over the last two hundred years? How were modern urban spaces shaped around the twin delights of consumption and leisure? How did consumer culture become a source of class distinction, identity formation, gendered stereotypes, and creative expression? What role did consumer culture play in promoting European imperial and colonial projects and resisting empire? In the postwar era, how did modernization and Americanization change European consumer habits? How did groups like the Situationist International, Dutch Provos, and West Berlin&rsquo;s Kommune 1 levy political critiques against mass consumption as a source of alienation? How did these critiques evolve into larger anti-globalization movements in the 1990s?

From comparative to national perspective, this course engages American political economy&rsquo;s public-private mix; anti-immigration sentiment&#39;s and segregation&rsquo;s limits on national health insurance; the Civil Rights Movement&rsquo;s healthcare reforms; the persistent reproduction of health inequality despite de jure desegregation; resistance to and breakthroughs for Medicaid expansion in the contemporary era; and prospects for future reform.</p>"

Even the shortest photographic exposure, however, captures something longer than an instant&mdash;a more or less lengthy duration&mdash;so that, in spite of its stillness, every photograph is also a record of change over time. And in more obvious ways, as representations of temporally distant people, places, and events, photography stands in a fascinating and complex relation to time. We will explore this relation through a combination of reading, discussion, analysis of photographs and films, and, above all, through the creation of original photographs.</p><p>The practical component of the seminar will introduce students to the fundamentals of both digital and film photography, but with an emphasis on film and darkroom techniques. Darkroom work will be conducted in the Eliot House Darkroom. As the course will be fundamentally bound to the physical spaces of Eliot House, students will collaborate in a creative photographic project documenting the spaces and collective life of Eliot House in the last year before the house undergoes renewal. In addition to conventional cameras, we will explore a variety of alternative ways of making photographs, including solargraphy (long-term exposures documenting the sun&rsquo;s path over weeks or months), home-made pinhole cameras, cyanotype printing, and the use of photographic emulsions on materials other than paper. We will even explore the possibility of turning Eliot House itself into a large-format camera (by constructing a temporary camera obscura in the gateway that looks out onto Memorial Drive and JFK St.).</p>"

The course examines how religion in port cities and islands was centered upon a plethora of saints, missionaries, divinities and other agents of Islam, who have been marginalized in academic literature on the Indian Ocean. It simultaneously examines how oceanic religion was intimately connected to economic, political and technological developments. Students will be introduced to scholarship on oceanic Islam and monsoon Islam, before they are introduced to a variety of sources on transregional Islamic networks and agents of Islam, including biographies, hagiographies, travelogues, novels, poems and ethnographic accounts. Students will, moreover, be encouraged to consider ways in which approaches to studying Islam could be enhanced by a focus on religious economies and networks, as well as the lives of &lsquo;subalterns&rsquo; who crossed the porous borders of the Indian Ocean world and shaped its religious worlds.</p>"

The State of Israel, and its definition of Judaism, has become an important touchstone in American politics, while antisemitic dog whistles have become commonplace in contemporary political discourse. Contemporary left-wing activists often refer to the legacies&mdash;contested or otherwise&mdash;of Jewish American labor politics of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. What can we make of these intersecting and surprising references to Jews/Judaism/Jewishness in the current American moment? This seminar discusses the ways that images of the Jew&mdash;philosemitic, antisemitic, and everything in between&mdash;recur in the American mainstream.

We cover the evolutive significance of the gut-brain connection and discuss how contemporary lifestyles may be influencing its composition and, consequently, human health. By the conclusion of this seminar, students will acquire insights into the pathways through which gut microbes influence diverse brain functions, the external factors shaping the gut microbiota, the repercussions of its disruption, and the current methodologies employed to study and modify its composition. The course will comprise a mix of brief lectures and discussions centered around papers previously curated by the instructor or suggested by the students. Students will be encouraged to ask questions and pursue the answers by exploring the available literature and propose experimental ideas. In this way, students will be able to shape the class content according to their own interests. Additionally, we have two guest speakers scheduled to join us.</p>"

In the past several decades, exciting new discoveries on the neurobiology of sleep have been facilitated by technologies such as functional neuroimaging and molecular genetics. Nonetheless, sleep remains mysterious and controversial and, remarkably, there still is no generally agreed upon function for this behavioral state that occupies one third of our lives! Sleep science exemplifies the translational approach in biomedical science whereby human and animal research together continually advance the field of sleep medicine. In this seminar, lectures during the first half of each class will provide overviews of the physiology and behavioral neuroscience of sleep.The second half of each class will be devoted to student-led discussions of assigned study questions as well as free discussions. In a short term paper, students will research in depth a topic of their choice that they find particularly interesting related to sleep neuroscience or mental health.Students will also briefly present what they have learned about their topic during the final class meetings. Some topics students might choose are described in the following paragraph. In addition, students will keep a nightly sleep and/or dream diary for 2-3weeks at some point during the semester in order to learn more about sleep from their own experiences.They will then describe what they have observed in a short essay.In the past, students have found this exercise to be especially interesting. Lastly, there will be a short open-book, unlimited-time final exam on material from the lectures.Topics for term papers might include the characteristic abnormalities of sleep in mood, anxiety, psychotic, addictive or neurodevelopmental disorders.Scientific findings increasingly point to the importance of sleep for mental health and optimum performance, as well as to sleep disruption as both a result and a contributing cause of mental illnesses. Thus,one might focus on the contribution of primary sleep disorders to psychiatric and neurological illness,such as the circadian rhythm disorders in bipolar illness or insomnia as a risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders. Still other topics might focus on the contribution of normal sleep to emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and cognitive performance. For those with more cellular neuroscience interests, topics might focus on linkages between sleep and immunity or the role of sleep in disposal of abnormal proteinsas it relates to neurodegenerative diseases.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>Constructing a map of the connections between the 86 billion neurons in the human brain has been a goal of neuroscience since the field originated. Connectomics research, which aims to understand how the brain is wired together into this map, has shown the human brain to be a complex network with the same properties that other complex networks exhibit. Much like our social networks, the world wide web, and our travel systems, the brain demonstrates organization along similar principles as these networks and can be studied using techniques adapted from network science. Using this &quot;network neuroscience&quot; approach has shown that the brain&#39;s gray matter is organized into a functional connectome comprised of modules called brain networks that orchestrate their functions to support our everyday activities. More recently, advances in another MRI technique called diffusion MRI have made it possible to study the organization of the brain&rsquo;s white matter &quot;information highways&quot;, or structural connectome, that transmit information from brain region-to-brain region, brain network-to-brain network. MRI-based connectomics is a rapidly growing field, with new methods and applications evolving at an incredibly fast pace and there are now numerous large-scale neuroimaging initiatives across the world that are aimed at mapping the human brain connectome. These studies aim to map the human brain connectome across the lifespan, from in utero&nbsp;to the oldest old, and in brain disorders such as mental illnesses, developmental disorders, neurological disorders and other health conditions. The goal of this class is to understand how MRI can be used to study the living human brain connectome and the latest advances these approaches have revealed in our understanding of the wiring of the brain. We will also dive into some of the large-scale neuroimaging datasets to see how we can leverage these open access resources for connectomics research. This course is designed for students in the MBB programs who are interested in learning about how we study brain connectivity and how the brain is organized, including those who are interested in neuroscience applications and brain disorders and those interested in bioinformatics/computer science/statistics/physics applications in neuroimaging. To unlock the &ldquo;black box&rdquo; nature of the sophisticated MRI methods used for connectomics research, we will learn the basics of the workhorse MRI connectomics methods, functional and diffusion MRI, from a conceptual perspective. We will learn how each of these techniques is used for connectomics studies and some key methodological and interpretational issues for each. Then we will focus on the brain&rsquo;s connectome. We will discuss brain organization, including how to construct a brain graph as the mathematical embodiment of the brain&rsquo;s connectome and how to evaluate the brain&rsquo;s network properties using graph theory and other approaches, the brain networks that have been reported in the literature, and the links between structural and functional connectomes. We will do a survey of widely used open access tools for connectivity and connectome analyses, and open access connectome datasets with sample sizes of hundreds up to a hundred thousand, including the Human Connectome Lifespan and Disease Connectome studies, the ABCD study, and the UK Biobank. These datasets will also be used as hypothetical data sources for your final research projects. Last, we will discuss ethical, computational, and statistical issues when working with these large open access datasets.&nbsp;</p>"

In the surviving texts, these registers may vary significantly, depending on the author and their audience, the genre and other contextual factors.

Since its inception, the Harvard Jazz Orchestra has served as the vehicle for students across disciplines to study and learn the jazz canon. Over the years, the Jazz Orchestra has focused on the literature of Duke Ellington and complete retrospective concerts of the music of Charles Mingus, Charlie Parker, Gerry Mulligan, Lee Konitz, Benny Carter, Buck Clayton, Clark Terry, J. J. Johnson, and Julius Hemphill. Other literature has ranged from the classic arrangements of Count Basie and Fletcher Henderson to the modern jazz of Gil Evans and Charles Mingus, the contemporary ensemble improvisations of Barry Guy and Lester Bowie, and the jazz-rock of Michael Gibbs, Russ Gershon Harvard &rsquo;81, Rufus Reid, George Cables and Cassandra Wilson. In 2015, Yosvany Terry was appointed Director of Jazz Bands. Under his direction, the Harvard Jazz Orchestra continues this tradition of focusing on a program of study that provides students with a grounding in a wide range of iconic and new literature.

How is the brain set up to sense the world, integrate incoming sensory information, and lead to movement and behavior, and how is that organized during development?

This course explores how properties of molecules, cells, and circuits enable detection and perception across a wide variety of stimuli. Through discussion of primary literature, we will cover basic concepts in sensory transduction, information coding, and functional organization of sensory systems, with examples across systems, including specialized senses such as electroreception. We will also examine how sensory signals interact with each other and how sensory systems are embedded in tight feedback loops for appropriate motor control. This class offers students an opportunity to discuss and synthesize cutting edge work in sensory neuroscience.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>Among the many unique challenges that multicellular organisms face relative to unicellular ones is how they deal with the death (or loss) of a part of the organism. Should the organism heal and continue life without the missing part, or should it regrow that part? The vast majority of animal (and plant) lineages have species that will replace the missing portion, i.e., they are capable of regeneration. Despite the phylogenetically widespread nature of regeneration, very little is known about any universal cellular, molecular and genetic principles, if any, that control this process. In pursuit of these principles, the course will delve into the literature from a diverse range of species. We will focus on stem cells, which enable the production of new cells that reconstitute the missing tissues. First, we will address what it means to be a stem cell. We will explore how molecular studies of adult stem cells in species ranging from jellyfish to humans are revealing essential and highly evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanisms for stem cells. Second, we will compare the features of adult stem cells to those of other multipotent cells, such as early embryonic cells. Third, we will consider how different species maintain pluripotent stem cells versus those with restricted potential, i.e., lineage-restricted stem cells. We will explore these ideas through the critical reading of the primary literature, including both classical and very recent papers in stem cell biology. Students will obtain a deep understanding of the main concepts and methods concerning the study of stem cells and will become familiar with comparative approaches as applied to stem cell biology and regeneration.</p>"

We&#39;ll then turn to moral theories, investigating the relative strengths and weaknesses of those views that focus only on our actions&#39; consequences, and those that reject this approach. In closing, we&#39;ll consider questions about the status of morality. What kind of judgment are we making when we say, for example, that something is morally wrong? Are there moral facts awaiting our discovery? If there are, how did they come to be - are they determined by humans and varying across cultures, like facts about the law or etiquette?

In this seminar historical perspectives and recent technological advances will be surveyed to showcase the opportunities, limitations, and unmet challenges of precision exploration within the individual. Discussions will begin from a historical perspective, then survey examples where breakthroughs were made from case studies (neuropsychology) and small N samples (neurophysiology), and then progress into approaches that allow precision neuroscientific exploration (including intensive repeat scanning as in the MyConnectome project) and dynamic behavioral phenotyping using wearables and new remote testing technologies. Challenges including how to frame hypotheses, considerations of the goals toward generalization, and discussion of new statistical approaches will be included in the readings.

Since young children understand more than they can say, we will also cover how researchers figure out what kids know, based on naturalistic recordings and short in-lab experiments. For psychology concentrators and students on the Cognitive Science track of affiliated departments under the Mind Brain Behavior initiative, this discussion-based seminar offers an in-depth examination of the complex yet foundational processes by which we master our very first forms of communication.&nbsp;</p>"

For example, deciding to tell the grocery store assistant that you forgot to scan an item through to avoid punishment is quite different than doing so because you see yourself as an honest person and simply want to do the &lsquo;right&rsquo; thing. How do such external and internal motivations aide children&rsquo;s moral development? Throughout this course we will discuss the role of culture in how children learn about morality and consider how to tease apart universal development and development that is influenced by culture.&nbsp;</p>"

After midterm we start with model based recursive partitioning where we integrate the concept of decision trees into regression modeling. This is followed by shrinkage/regularization techniques (lasso, elasticnet) which are attractive for regression scenarios with many predictors. After an introduction to basic time series techniques and spatial regression, we have an advanced Bayesian regression modeling where we use INLA instead of MCMC for estimation.

If you are a psychology concentrator at Harvard, you may have already taken classroom-based courses covering theories and methods that guide research in clinical psychology, such as Abnormal Psychology and Developmental Psychopathology.&nbsp; You may also have taken courses that introduced you to the types of statistical analyses (Psych 1900) and research methods (Psych 1901) used in psychological research.&nbsp; In this course, we will build on the foundation you received in such courses by applying what you have learned to the conduct of specific research projects.</p><p>In this class, you will participate in several aspects of the clinical research process via your active involvement in the research of our psychology laboratory.&nbsp; More specifically, through attending weekly class/lab meetings and participating in one or more research projects, you will learn how specific research ideas take shape; how research questions and hypotheses are generated; how studies are designed to address these research questions and hypotheses; how data are collected, cleaned, entered into study datasets, then analyzed; and how findings are interpreted and organized for presentation at professional meetings and in scientific publications.&nbsp;</p><p>The main goals of research in our lab are to build an understanding of which interventions for child and adolescent mental health problems are effective, and to promote use of the best evidence-based assessment and intervention in everyday clinical practice for youths and families. In pursuing these goals, we and our colleagues develop ways of structuring evidence-based practices to make them user-friendly and tailored to the settings in which youngsters typically receive mental health care&mdash;e.g., community mental health clinics and schools. Much of our work focuses on developing and testing these tailored approaches. We also conduct meta-analyses of the youth psychotherapy research literature, to sum up what has been learned from all the treatment studies with children and adolescents.</p><p>This course is designed to be useful to students who plan to pursue a career in child and adolescent mental health, particularly those with an interest in psychological research.&nbsp; However, the skills conveyed (e.g., critical thinking, research design, science writing) may be useful in a variety of ways and relevant to a number of different career paths.</p>"

Why and how does often remarkable recovery from brain surgery or injury occur in young children, but not so much in later life? How is the brain set up to sense the world, integrate incoming sensory information, and lead to movement and behavior, and how is that organized during development?

Students will hear about treatments, including small molecules (conventional medicines), whose therapeutic actions can be attributed to the regulation of tissue-specific stem cells that reside in key adult tissues including the bone marrow and brain, but, interestingly, not including the heart or pancreas. Finally, they will be exposed to relatively new work that demonstrates the possibility of creating new cells from old by using genetic methods to swap cell identities.&nbsp;A typical type of question that we will debate is: When should Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients be treated with a drug to slow the death of neurons, with transplanted neurons made from pluripotent cells or with a viral vector that produces new neurons from existing glial cells in the brain?&nbsp;</p><p>This course will highlight the theoretical, as well as the practical, aspects of drug development.

A significant part of the course will be dedicated to the Soviet period: we will study how Ukrainian modernists both reflected Soviet culture and subverted it; we will look at how Ukrainian dissidents defied the Soviet order and managed to create outstanding literary works even in the extreme circumstances of the Gulag. Finally, we will analyze some of the poetry, prose, and film that seek to articulate the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, shedding light on its causes and stakes. In studying some of Ukraine&rsquo;s literary masterpieces, we will tunnel to the heart of the phenomenon of resistance: its philosophy, aesthetics, cultural practices, and historical reverberations.

How have the stories, poems, plays, movies, memoirs, and documentaries of the last thirty years set up current cultural activists to find their voices and use them effectively? What has diaspora come to mean, and how have cultural figures in far-flung places created a sense of shared identity?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our course will ask how we got to this place, and how to read its ethics and aesthetics. We will trace the chaotic transitions of the 1990s, the disparities of wealth and polarized politics of the 2000s, and the protests of the 2000s and 2010s, and the complex rise of religious thinking (Orthodox, Islam, Jewish).&nbsp;</p><p>We will read works set within Russia&rsquo;s borders, in former Soviet republics, and much further afield, in sites of emigration and self-exile. Themes of historical trauma and reconciliation, of war and rebellion, of sexual expression and sexual freedom, and feminist and LGBTQ resistance will be explored.&nbsp;<br /><br />Writings by Svetlana Aleksievich, Joseph Brodsky, Keti Chukhrov, Elena Fanailova, Alisa Ganieva, Linor Goralik, Boris Khersonsky, Vladimir Sorokin, Maria Stepanova, Lida Yusupova, and others.

Four years later, saving democracy is still the center of his second presidential campaign. Is liberal democracy indeed in crisis? This course examines several aspects of this ongoing debate to better understand the symptoms, scope and causes of this alleged turning point. It reviews a series of political maladies that are seen as evidence of the democratic decay&mdash;from extreme polarization to populist leadership to the failure of the party system among others. It then surveys the competing explanations (economic, political and cultural) that led democracy to the crossroads and explores the institutional arrangements&mdash;from lottocracy to citizen assemblies, etc.&mdash;that have been proposed as remedies for the democratic deficit. It assesses the intersections and departures of the phenomenon between the democracies of the Global North and South, in particular Latin America. Finally, the course suggests an alternative angle to the problem. It focuses not on the democratic political regime and its institutions but on democracy as a social order and the transformation of its social roots. We critically explore how the experience of being an individual in democracy has changed (mediated by several displacements such as technology, solitude, alienation, organized crime, comparative metric, inequality, and gender identities), and whether the erosion of the collectivist dimension of democracy (its public sphere, social and labor organizations, and state capacities) may suggest that we face a new great social transformation at odds with the old institutional scaffolding of the democratic regime.

The aim is to collaboratively articulate, over the course of the semester, an amplified social theoretic framework that enables us to critically engage the existential challenges and potential dangers of new technology and normatively evaluate scientific and technological innovations from the standpoint of human flourishing.

        "course_description": "<p>This class takes a psychosocial approach to understanding the relationship between capitalism and contemporary subjectivity. In particular it looks at how core entrepreneurial practices and values (e.g., managed risk, competition, flexibility) are taken up outside of business schools as individuals in all walks of life&nbsp;are increasingly compelled to treat themselves as an enterprise or brand. Among the questions we will ask: How and when did the compulsion towards self-branding come to be and what are its psychological and sociological effects? How do these practices shape people&rsquo;s experiences of themselves, others, and future possibilities? Does the contemporary &quot;entrepreneurial&rdquo; self express itself differently in other cultures? To address these questions, we begin with anthropological and historical examples of a variety of ways personhood has been constituted. We then trace the genealogy of the &ldquo;self&quot; against the backdrop of capitalism&rsquo;s transformation, exploring the contradictory forms of liberation and domination that accompany&nbsp;entrepreneurial self-making. Specific case studies will include therapy, self-help, social entrepreneurialism, education, technology, and volunteerism. This theory intensive class draws from a range of disciplines while introducing students to the key methods of sociocultural anthropology. This is a junior tutorial. &nbsp;</p>"

In the recent history of Latin America, there are multiple instances where aesthetics and politics have intertwined in order to create and find new meanings for the issues plaguing the region. If a citizen participates in both the action of being governed and the action of governing, there is no doubt that aesthetics, understood as the formal exploration of the distribution of the sensible, as Ranci&egrave;re would say, is a productive space for analysis to understand Latin American intellectual and political traditions.</p><p>In this course, we will panoramically explore the relationship between aesthetics and politics throughout the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries in Latin America. By studying cinema, literature, art, music, and more, the objective is to offer students an approach to how art and culture bear witness, often in a more visceral and affective way than is possible from a purely historiographical or sociological approach, to what politics cannot resolve. We will analyze and discuss Latin American productions based on key aesthetic concepts (manifesto, declamation, performance, documentary, etc.), in order to trace and outline the anxieties plaguing both art and contemporary Latin American criticism.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>As a literary event, as a narrative artifact bent on capturing the totality of the real, the novel has been at war with its form, its social function, and its reading publics, at least since it emerged as a global, privileged narrative genre. These historical conditions were always particularly intense in the peripheries of the world. In Latin America, the novel was born as a battlefield where writers disputed the meaning of what it meant to be modern (what kind of novels do we need to write to inscribe ourselves in the transnational literary world of modernity where novels rule?). For them, the novel as a cultural monument revered globally was a thing of the past; they felt the need to reinvent it in order to account for their own time and marginal geopolitical situation. This course will interrogate how Argentine writers addressed these cultural dilemmas since the 1920s and, in the process, produced some of the region&rsquo;s most remarkable experimental novels, non-novels, and anti-novels, as well as insightful reflections on the cultural potential and blindspots of literature as a social institution. We will read texts by Macedonio Fern&aacute;ndez, Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cort&aacute;zar, Silvina Ocampo, Adolfo Bioy Casares, Manuel Puig, Alejandra Pizarnik, Juan Jos&eacute; Saer, Sylvia Molloy, Ricardo Piglia, C&eacute;sar Aira, Tamara Kamenszain, Sergio Chejfec and Selva Almada.</p>"

The purpose of this course, on the contrary, is to discover and examine the unfailing dynamism of the Latin American Conservative mind, such as it has thrived and developed from the 18th century until today. How does a Conservative think? What sort of arguments, metaphors, images, does he or she usually utilize? What kind of world does he or she live in? What does it mean to be a Conservative in Latin America? What has it meant throughout the last two centuries? The course will equip students with the tools necessary to answer these and other related questions, providing a comprehensive overview of what has changed, and what not, within the Conservative Imagination. In terms of reading materials, it combines primary texts penned by monarchists, authoritarians, Ultramontane Catholics, fascists, neo-liberals, and reactionaries of all sorts, with key secondary literature such as the works of Antoine Compagnon, Albert O.

This seminar course is offered in response to these needs. Discussions will be co-led by several faculty members in the Departments of Statistics and Biostatistics at Harvard with active participation by students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty, with the goal of stimulating and discussing several cutting-edge ongoing research areas on scalable statistical and machine learning methods for big data. Students and postdoctoral fellows will work with faculty on group class presentations. The class is expected to have a lot of active discussions of current ongoing methodological research of faculty participants.</p><p>The discussions include current research activities, challenges and open problems. Examples include feature selection, distributed and federated learning, ensemble learning, high-dimensional prediction and testing,&nbsp; dense and sparse signal detection, sparse and low-rank covariance matrix estimation, network analysis, penalized likelihood and post selection inference, causal inference, topic modeling, random projection and sketching, &nbsp;and generative AI. &nbsp;Applications of these methods in various areas will be discussed. &nbsp;</p>"

These myths, though perhaps less familiar than those of ancient Greece and Rome or of ancient Egypt, offer profound insights into ideas of the cosmos, society, and humanity circulating in the ancient world. Sumerian myths and their Akkadian retellings also played a major role in the development of modern theories of mythology, with scholars of the 20th century taking a great interest in stories such as Dumuzi&rsquo;s death and &ldquo;resurrection,&rdquo; or the great flood sent to destroy humankind. In this course, we will examine thirteen of these stories in detail, discussing their themes, characters, and literary style. We will see how they are relevant not just to study ancient society and culture, but also to reflect on our lives today.</span></span></p>"

We will delve deeply into genres of arts practices that could help you to imagine a way forward in your own work. In doing so, the goal is to advance your transition into a professional life in theater, dance, and media, and the identify your key concerns (both artistic and pragmatic) regarding a professional practice. Throughout the semester we will discuss how your personal goals and concerns intersect with political, social, and individual contemporary preoccupations in those fields.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This junior tutorial is designed to organize participants into a&nbsp;community of singular artist interlocutors who can also supportively engage with one another&rsquo;s projects. You will develop methods to articulate your own intentions and impulses with great specificity, offer appropriate feedback for the stage of development for your peer&rsquo;s projects, and acquire facility with terms of art in theater, dance &amp; media.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our semester is oriented to gaining autonomy and independence in relation to your interests. For the first seven weeks of the semester, we will read and explore a number of topics and ideas regarding the development of a sustainable arts practice, all the while, developing a specific set of questions pertinent to each class member&rsquo;s interests in the concentration. At the end of the seven weeks, students will present (both in person and online) on a company or artist whose work you have been researching in depth (the options are outlined in week 7 of the syllabus).&nbsp;We then pivot to your topics brought up during the first half of the semester &ndash; in essence the class will be building and completing the syllabus for the last half of October and November and December, while discussing and workshopping the development of their thesis ideas.</p>"

At the center of these forms of violence are the control of&nbsp;<em>breath</em>&nbsp;as life force, and as a sign of freedom.

Artists and grassroots organizers use aesthetics and collective action to transform the horror of being subject to violence at any moment into rituals of&nbsp;<em>breath&nbsp;</em>and potential social transformation. This course then teaches students theories of ritual and performance as ways that communities have historically engaged and confronted histories of anti-Black violence in order to conceive of new future possibilities to embody liberation in the face of disciplinary actions meant to contain and choke Black people.

Kelley advises, &ldquo;without new visions, we don&rsquo;t know what to build, only what to knock down. We not only end up confused, rudderless, and cynical, but we forget that making a revolution is not a series of clever maneuvers and tactics, but a process that can and must transform us.&rdquo; Throughout this semester-long exploration, we will build with the Harvard community, extending to local community members, where we will then document our experience for those that are interested in contributing to the culminating digital project showcased during our Community Gathering.&nbsp;</p><p>As bell hooks articulates in &quot;Teaching to Transgress,&quot; engaged pedagogy is the practice of cultivating a classroom that shifts the professor-student hierarchy, which assumes the professor is the ultimate expert who bestows knowledge upon their students. Engaged pedagogy instead insists that both students and professor can learn from each other, acknowledging the lived experiences and embodied knowledge every person carries. Building on the idea of engaged pedagogy, Collective Freedom Dreaming demonstrates the actual practice of engaged pedagogy by examining how my students and I create a &quot;healthy classroom&quot; and build community together, which I will reference as &ldquo;our classroom&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;my classroom&rdquo; because the ownership implied by &ldquo;my classroom&rdquo; contradicts the inherent communalism of engaged pedagogy. Our engaged pedagogy pushes students and community members to imagine the world they want to live in, and become the shift needed to create this world. In addition to honing their academic skills by classroom assignments, I encourage students to break the confines of the ivory tower and grow as community organizers by producing individual and group projects for professional advancement and for the community, putting theory into action mainly through community organizing and creative projects. In doing so, students actively construct their imagined new world grounded in their academic studies, which provides the theoretical framework to analyze the world. With inspiration from the vocabulary of Kelley, and their &ldquo;collective freedom dreams,&rdquo; through artistic expression, meditation, and collective action, we lead community members in a process of alchemy, transcendence and transformation that shifts us toward a new vision of liberation. Finally, this course, and digital project, will honor the legacy of bell hooks as we choose to love and grow together in a process that will transform us by embodying our [collective] freedom dreams.</p>"

In it, one can find an environment where different interests coincide, from art to activism, from public policy to urban planning, from political agendas to healing activities, from institutional critique to community art, from identity politics to social architecture. While the community working on this practice has agreed over the years on several ethical guidelines, each case needs to be analyzed in relationship with the cultural and political context where it is developed. Its creation is shaped by its reception.<br /><br />Does Socially Engaged Art propose new systems of cooperation? The generation of an alternative social production? A scored collective performance? Is it created by working about, with or for a specific constituency? Are audiences transformed into participants, members, or active citizens? Does this practice seek to change reality or show it? What is the right scale for such a project? Are these projects taken from or given to the communities? How are they started and how do they come to an end? What is their appropriate duration? Can a project mutate, be replicated, or appropriated by others?<br /><br />This genre not only puts into question several assertions overlooked in the conventional practice of Art but also puts the role of the artist into question. What is assumed as proprietary in art, theater and social science in Socially Engaged Art is owned by all. Often, the artist&rsquo;s presence, even when it may create the first intervention, weakens over time in a direct relationship with the growth of the new community that the project enhances. Coauthored aesthetic experiences help us rethink the idea of collective creativity and what is the pertinence of the performative. It is also conceptually important to consider what channels are going to be built to collaborate with institutions. While Socially Engaged Art is created in the public sphere it is not necessarily Public Art as monuments and cultural entertainment are. The allies in each project are not defined by automatic assumptions but by building mutual trust whether at an institutional or personal level.</p>"

It traces the complicated relationship between colonialism, slavery, racism, and feminist liberatory projects in case studies from America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East from the nineteenth century until today. Over the course of the semester, we will explore key questions: How has feminist thought shaped ideas of liberation in our contemporary world? What is the relationship between empire and feminism? And what is the place of decolonization, antiracism, and decarceration in global feminist thought? We will immerse ourselves in rare materials on global, Third World, and women of color feminisms through the close reading of the archives and writings of women and LGBTQ communities from around the world. Over the course of the semester, you will build a toolkit of critical thinking and writing skills by engaging diverse primary sources, ranging from political texts, short stories, posters, movies, to human rights reports.
