        "course_description": "<p>The 2023-2024 Warren Center for American History workshop brings together an interdisciplinary group of historians, social scientists, humanists, and scholars of black political thought to explore what might be at stake &mdash; philosophically, theoretically, culturally, and politically &mdash; in revisiting the Black Power Movement in the present. Building on the successes of Black Power Studies scholars, this seminar seeks to resist unduly defensive and siloed forms of scholarly engagement, to openly and critically interrogate Black Power&rsquo;s political and cultural dynamics, social formations, and conceptual contributions to political and social thought across such key concerns as political violence, education, the philosophy of race, cultural politics, gender, political economy, and more. Engaging the work-in-progress of visiting scholars, faculty, and other guests, the seminar will provide an extended opportunity to reflect upon the political and intellectual legacy of Black Power, the place of black radical traditions in academic scholarship, and how historians, theorists, and social scientists might work more collaboratively to pursue the hard questions the movement continues to raise.</p><p>To receive credit for this course students must enroll in part A and part B in the same academic year.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>This seminar studies contemporary struggles over citizenship and belonging by Afrodescendants in Latin America, situating these struggles within historical patterns of nation building, racial stratification, and political mobilization. Afrodescendants have been at the forefront of struggles typically associated with liberal values&mdash;equality, democracy, voting rights&mdash;since the colonial period. But Afrodescendant activists, thinkers, and artists have also articulated alternative visions of freedom and belonging that are frequently sidelined in the dominant narratives about rights and citizenship in Latin America. The seminar is conducted in conjunction with the Sawyer Seminar &ldquo;Afrodescendant Citizenship in Latin America&rdquo; funded by the Mellon Foundation. This will allow us to bring scholars, activists, artists and other practitioners involved in struggles for racial justice in Latin America to our class and our campus.<br />Undergraduate students who wish to take this class should get in touch with the instructors in advance.&nbsp;Students must complete both terms of this course (parts A and B) within the same academic year in order to receive credit. Students need to register under History or AAAS but not both for credit.</p>"

Throughout, we assume that Africa is not a unique isolate but a continent bubbling with internal diversity, historical change, entrepreneurial spirit, and cultural links beyond its shores. Our goal is to train students to think rigorously about Africa from interdisciplinary and transnational perspectives. We also aim to equip students with the analytical tools necessary for recognizing and deconstructing reductionist and stereotyped narratives of Africa. The course is open to all students who are interested in exploring various dimensions of African life, politics, peoples and cultures from the past to the postcolony.</p>"

The study of race in the social sciences and humanities is an established, dynamic, multidisciplinary, and international field. To understand race and racism with a global perspective, it is necessary to have a transdisciplinary, cross-cultural view to read critically the phenomena that intersect with this variable. Course readings are drawn from the fields of African and African American Studies, sociology, history, cultural studies, political science, anthropology, philosophy, journalism, and public health. The vast literature produced by scholars in diverse fields provides evidence of how race is based on narratives created to enslave, subordinate, exploit, and exclude millions of human beings across the globe. Assignments will address pressing real-world questions related to race and racism, as well as pedagogically significant areas of undergraduate intellectual and academic development.&nbsp;</span></p>"
