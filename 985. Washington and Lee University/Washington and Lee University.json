We read the work of scholars who are trying to make sense of the complicated ways in which gender intersects with other power structures such as race, class, sexuality, and nationality. The course first introduces several key terms in gender and queer studies including intersectionality, social constructivism, oppression, and heteronormativity. Using these terms, we then further analyze topics such as the family as a social institution, gender in the workplace, beauty norms, gendered violence, the history of feminist and queer activism, and gender and queer identity in immigration law. Assignments encourage students to analyze their other academic pursuits, as well as the non-academic environments in which they live, including thinking critically about their own experiences in contemporary society. The course provides a foundation in feminist analysis for students who wish to complete a minor in Women\u2019s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. It is also appropriate for students at any level who are seeking a more systematic understanding of how gendered dynamics shape the subjects of their major studies or the practices of their daily lives."

Evolutionary psychology is not an area of psychology, like social psychology or cognitive psychology, but is instead a lens through which all human behavior can be explained.

This course travels to Edinburgh, Glasgow, and the Highlands to allow students to go beyond the mythologizing and romance to discover Scotland as it has been experienced and performed by the Scottish people. Using Scotland\u2019s vibrant and remarkably political theater scene as our jumping-off point, we study this country\u2019s history and culture, examining the powerful intersections of myth and reality that shape Scottish identity past and present. We pay particular attention to the dichotomies \u2013 Highland and Lowland; urban and rural; separatist and unionist; poor and rich; Protestant and Catholic, etc. \u2013 that make modern Scotland such a fascinating subject of historical and artistic inquiry."

Often, tentative connections have been and are being made between the ways animals behave and how humans conduct themselves, thus conferring legitimacy on shared traits. The line of argument in making these linkages is simple and straightforward: if animals behave in certain ways, these ways are natural and therefore, beyond reproach; if humans share these traits, they, too, must be considered free of blame. Issues of gender and sexuality traditionally have been at the forefront of these considerations, but also the institutions of marriage, family, slavery, systems of government - monarchy, republic, etc. - as well as war, aggression, altruism and more have been argued for or against on the basis of animal examples."

But its most memorable practice, inquisition, is better remembered as a blood-thirsty and irrational institution that preyed upon free-thinking. What was heresy? Who defined it and why, after a hiatus of almost 500 years, did it all of a sudden seem to appear on the horizon in the 11th century? This course explores this turbulent but arguably creative moment in the history of Western culture and consider techniques of power, the creation of in-groups and out-groups, gender, literacy, politics, reform and revolt, and the nature of religious practice."

At once \u201cthe best of times\u201d and \u201cthe worst of times,\u201d the Revolution was both the origin of modern democracy and a period of tremendous political violence - indeed, some say it is the origins of totalitarianism. In this seminar, we study the following questions: What are the origins of the Revolution? How did a revolution that began with proclamations of human rights turn into one of mass bloodshed in just a few short years? How did a desire for democracy lead to political violence? What was the nature of the Terror, and how can we understand it? We also examine how various schools of history have interpreted the Revolution, as well as the legacy of the Revolution."

To most U.S. Americans, the Middle Ages is an era known for Inquisition, book burning, and the brutal silencing of political and religious dissent. Yet, compared to more modern censoring institutions, the institutions of medieval Europe held much weaker powers of enforcement, different motives for censoring, and ambiguous technologies to do so. What and who could censor (or be censored) in a society without the printing press? Among other topics, we cover the public vs. private spheres; artistic liberty; religious vs. political concerns; gender; and the role of and limitations upon the modern historian investigating a censored past."

Indeed, the discursive spaces that black political thinkers created became major sites of knowledge production and provided momentum for black mobilization. Beginning with David Walker\u2019s Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World (1829), this course will probe landmark texts by and about African American thinkers including Maria Stewart, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Malcolm X., and Angela Davis. Students will evaluate historical perspectives on topics including racial uplift, feminism, black nationalism, and Pan-Africanism.

In this course, we explore the nuts and bolts of genetic engineering and a small sampling of its applications, including developing drugs and vaccinations, enhancing crops, testing for genetic diseases, and genetic testing in the courtroom. These applications introduce ethical considerations for us to debate. In addition, we use molecular-biology tools to carry out our own genetic engineering projects with spider silk genes, which have potential for multiple medical and industrial applications.

Leaving Eden, Ur, or Israel; being sold from one\u2019s homeland into slavery; losing the messiah\u2013 all of these exiles are critical to any study of the Bible, as well as later literature based on the Bible. As the poet John Milton well understood, exile, by its nature, includes longing for a return either to Paradise, to one\u2019s homeland, or to the deity\u2019s presence on earth; it can also include desire for a new settlement, and a new historical era. Themes of exile and return connect the Bible to the genre of epic, another ancient literary form, where homecoming and settlement sometimes hail the beginning of a new people, nation, or age. In this class we explore themes of exile and return in Genesis and Exodus, I and II Kings, Ezekiel, the Gospels of Matthew and John, and the books of Acts and Revelation. Exile and return feature not just as recurrent themes in separate books, but as narrative forms themselves (such as epic, or even the law, which exiles narrative), as metaphors, spiritual states, and central tropes of Biblical literature. In addition to focused literary study, we engage with Biblical forms through the history of the book and in local religious contexts. We study rare Bibles available in special collections and facsimile, becoming familiar with how the bible was experienced in earlier historical periods. Finally, students engage in fieldwork involving attendance and observance of how local religious communities (outside of one\u2019s own faith tradition) read scripture today."

Can dramatic depictions of both wellness and illness catalyze us to think about how to better care for ourselves and others? Using the WHO\u2019s definition of health as a \u201cstate of complete physical, mental, and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity,\u201d we will think not only about how works of art dramatize these concepts, but also what they mean in our own lives and in the lives of those in our community.

The fan culture that now surrounds Austen, her spunky heroines, and her swoon-worthy heroes rivals that of Star Wars or Harry Potter. Austen enthusiasts meet for book club, wear Regency costumes, convene for tea, and throw balls with period-appropriate music and dance. All of this mooning over Mr. Darcy, however, could easily be the object of Austen\u2019s own satire. Mercilessly lampooning silliness and frivolity, \u201cdear Jane\u201d was more inveterate cynic than hopeless romantic. How, then, did Austen transform from biting social satirist to patron saint of chick lit? Beginning with three of Austen\u2019s novels, and then turning to the fan cultures surrounding Pride and Prejudice, this course examines the nature of fandom, especially its propensity to change and adapt the very thing it celebrates. What does it mean to be a fan? Is there such a thing as an \u201coriginal\u201d or authorial meaning of a text? What do Austen\u2019s fan cultures say about both the novels themselves and the society that appropriates them?"

In interrogating the history of Islam in America, we specifically pay attention to the ways in which religion, gender, class, race, and citizenship continue to inform representations of Muslims in the U.S."

Meditation has also been adopted by some in the West during the last century, often for psychological or physical benefits apart from any devotional context. What had traditionally been a practice of ordained monks was popularized in the West, a trend that then caught on in Asia as well. We look at the origins of meditative practices in Asian traditions using primary sources, social context, and personal experience of basic meditative techniques. The course concludes by noting that some contemporary neuroscientists are looking to meditation to better understand mind, brain, emotion, and cognition."

At many colleges, the traditional student experience involves leaving home and entering a new environment without the comfort and protection of their former social ties. On the one hand, severing old ties provides students freedom to explore new identities and perhaps even reinvent themselves. On the other hand, this state of detachment is stressful as students may compare themselves to their new peers and frequently ask themselves: \u201cHow do I measure up?\u201d, \u201cDo I fit in?\u201d, and \u201cDo I belong\u201d? This seminar explores the questions of what does it mean to \u201cbelong\u201d in college and how academic institutional structures shape inequalities in who gets to \u201cfit in\u201d and who \u201cbelongs\u201d. Students will also be asked to examine the additional barriers for inclusion and belonging for \u201cnontraditional\u201d students (e.g. first-generation and low-income students, students of color, non-heterosexual students, religious minorities, international students, students with disabilities, older students, etc.). Although \u201cbelonging\u201d and \u201cinclusion\u201d are current buzzwords on American college campuses, these issues are not new and it is clear that diversification has not led directly to integration, especially as colleges try to diversify their student body."

First, the relational nature of power. That is, power is not just something people \u201chave\u201d, but a set of structures linking social actors. Second, the relation between visibility and effectiveness of power. In other words, the most insidious forms of domination are the ones least noticeable to those involved in them."

Thiscourse surveys dynamics of race from diverse perspectives including prehistoric and modern human variability, classic and contemporary anthropological research, and critical race theory. We draw on intellectual work within and overlapping with anthropological positions - including those of Franz Boas, W.E.B DuBois, Ella Deloria, Zora Neale Hurston, James Baldwin, and Nikole Hannah-Jones - and explore ways in which the creation of race/racism happened historically \u201con the ground,\u201d varied cross-culturally, and persists in healthcare, law, immigration, economic opportunity, and education.

Some of the questions we address: How is the medical profession changing? What are the pros and cons of market-driven medicine? Does class have an enduring impact on health outcomes? Is it true that we are what our friends\u2019 eat? Can unconscious racial bias affect the quality of care for people of different ethnicities? What pitfalls have affected the way evidence-based medicine has been carried out?"

In the United States, \u201crace\u201d is a concept frequently taken for granted. But what does \u201crace\u201d signify? Does race denote something inherently biological, cultural, or structural about one\u2019s ancestry, background, or lifestyle? Is race truly a stable \u201cascribed\u201d characteristic that has predictive implications for peoples\u2019 everyday well-being? By specifically concentrating on the case study of health disparities for African-Americans in the United States, we explore the concept of \u201crace\u201d, and how societal conceptions of race affect health policy, people\u2019s health outcomes, their access to healthcare, and their relationship to the medical establishment."

Practitioners were thought that they could eventually arrive at covering laws as powerful as those of physics or, falling short of this ideal, arrive at significant generalizations about human phenomenon. This class explores the trajectory of this paradigmatic split among some of the founders of sociology and anthropology and how these theorists utilized their chosen paradigms to make sense of social and cultural life.

Students evaluate the films critically as historical products of their own times as well as current historical narratives of the past by examining each event through a pair of films produced at different times in PRC history. Students also examine post-1949 changes in China and its interpretation of its pre-1949 history, and so, by seeing how a country interprets its history at a given time."

What constituted acceptable punishment (torture, imprisonment, spectacle executions, penance) and how did this change over time?

Though only a small collection of islands in the North Atlantic, throughout these centuries Britain created, for good and for ill, an empire upon which the sun never set.

Memoir is a mosaic form, utilizing bits and pieces from autobiography, fiction, essay and poetry in ways that allow the author to muse (speculate, imagine, remember, and question) on their own life experiences. Modern literary memoir requires tremendous work from the author, as she moves both backward and forward in time, re-creates believable dialogue, switches back and forth between scene and summary, and controls the pace and tension of the story with lyricism or brute imagery. In short, the memoirist keeps her reader engaged by being an adept and agile storyteller. This is not straight autobiography. Memoir is more about what can be gleaned from a section of one\u2019s life than about chronicling an entire life. Like a mosaic, memoir is about the individual pieces as much as the eventual whole. Work focuses on reading established memoirists, free writing, and workshopping in and out of class."

We pay sustained attention to Chaucer\u2019s Middle English at the beginning of the semester to ease the reading process. Then we travel alongside the Canterbury pilgrims as they tell their tales under the guise of a friendly competition. The Canterbury Tales is frequently read as a commentary on the social divisions in late medieval England, such as the traditional estates, religious professionals and laity, and gender hierarchies. But despite the Tales\u2019 professed inclusiveness of the whole of English society, Chaucer nonetheless focuses inordinately on those individuals from the emerging middle classes. Our aim is to approach the Tales from the practices of historicization and theorization; that is, we both examine Chaucer\u2019s cultural and historical contexts and consider issues of religion, gender, sexuality, marriage, conduct, class, chivalry, courtly love, community, geography, history, power, spirituality, secularism, traditional authority, and individual experience. Of particular importance are questions of voicing and writing, authorship and readership. Lastly, we think through Chaucer\u2019s famous Retraction at the end\u201d of The Canterbury Tales, as well as Donald R.

We examine the myths of Arthur\u2019s heroic masculinity and Camelot, the adulterous love triangle at the heart of courtly love, the uncanny trans embodiment and queer sensibility of knighthood, the marriage plot, the uneven gendering of negative affects, the trans-species borders of the animal and the human, and alternate forms of sociality."

No one understood Henry\u2019s power more carefully than his daughter Elizabeth, who oversaw England\u2019s first spy network and jealously guarded her throne from rebel contenders. This course studies the writers who worked for the legendary Tudors, focusing on the love poetry of courtiers, trials, and persecution of religious dissidents, plays, and accounts of exploration to the new world. We trace how the ambitions of the monarch, along with religious revolution and colonial expansion, figure in the work of writers like Wyatt, Surrey, and Anne Askew; Spenser, Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Southwell; and Thomas More and Walter Ralegh."

Students read Milton in the context of literary criticism and place him within his historical milieu, not the least of which includes England\u2019s dizzying series of political metamorphoses from Monarchy to Commonwealth, Commonwealth to Protectorate, and Protectorate back to Monarchy."

We survey all of Kubrick\u2019s 13 feature films, more closely engage with several of the most important, and highlight a small but representative selection of King\u2019s vast oeuvre, emphasizing King\u2019s literary and cultural ambitions more than his practice as a master of horror.

Students then use these principles to create a lecture/demonstration for local 4th- and 5th-grade students, including meeting and discussing ideas with local principals, setting up performances, creating a concert that ties to Virginia SOLs in English, Science or Mathematics, making costumes, sets or other production elements, choreographing and performing the material. Students also prepare an evaluation of the production and create literature to leave with the teachers so that the basic principles used to create the performance can be continued if desired."

Amid a power vacuum created by conflict between warring Byzantium and Sasanian Iran, a polity emerged, drawing authority from a new faith, Islam. For the subsequent 400 years following the initial Islamic conquest, a series of Caliphates sponsored the construction of vast urban spaces, monuments, mosques, palaces, and other structures, some of which have remained in continuous use since. Alongside this, patronage of the visual arts more broadly including manuscripts, ivories, metalwork, and other media also thrived. The course will consider how this artistic and architectural output came to define Islamic Art as a visual tradition and as an academic discipline. It will do so by tracing artistic developments across the early Islamic world, ranging from the Iberian Peninsula in the West to North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia."

It was in some respects the period in which African American artists, writers, poets and others tabled bold new agendas for the ways in which they, as individuals, and as a nation-within-a-nation, might advance in what was to become the American century. This class will consider the multiple factors that gave rise to this astonishing and compelling cultural moment. The mixed results of the reconstruction era; the Great Migration, which saw very large numbers of African Americans move from the South to other parts of the country, namely the West coast and the great northern industrial centers; the defining contribution of Howard Professor Alain Locke, and so on. The class will also look at the variety of cultural expressions and artistic practices emerging out of the new epicenter of Black American life, Harlem. The Harlem Renaissance is of course something of a misnomer. It was not limited to Harlem, but in effect took place in many different parts of the US, from San Francisco to Chicago. Furthermore, it was perhaps a cultural birth, as much as it was a cultural rebirth, hence the important differentiation between the New Negro and the Old predecessor. Setting the Harlem Renaissance into a multiplicity of contexts, from African American art practices of the 19th century, to the reception African Americans received in European cities such as Paris, the class will be hugely informative, not just on what African American artists were doing in the early 20th century, but also the ways in which so many of today\u2019s debates and questions on race matters in the US can be traced back to what was happening in the country a century ago."

The course begins with a brief historical overview of the problem of free will and moral responsibility, and then examines a number of contemporary philosophical perspectives on this problem, including the seminal work of P. F. Strawson, Harry Frankfurt, Gary Watson, John Martin Fischer, Susan Wolf, and T. M. Scanlon, among others."

Gostin and Lindsay F. Wiley broadly define the scope of public health law as \u201cthe study of the legal powers and duties of the state to assure the conditions for people to be healthy (to identify, prevent and ameliorate risks to health in the population) and the limitations on the power of the state to constrain the autonomy, privacy, liberty, proprietary, or other legally protected interests of individuals for the common good.\u201d Similarly, they identify a lofty goal for the discipline: \u201cThe prime objective of public health law is to pursue the highest possible level of physical and mental health in the population, consistent with the values of social justice.\u201d Public health is \u201ca political and social undertaking\u201d that aims to improve population health through collective activity. As a political undertaking, public health includes government\u2019s central role, grounded in its power, to protect the public\u2019s health from imminent threat and to provide public goods that would not otherwise be available from individual action alone. As a social undertaking, public health includes many forms of social and community action to address complex social, behavioral and/or environmental conditions that affect health. Public health activity \u201cincreasingly involves overlapping networks of individuals and organizations, including governmental and private agencies, profit and not-for-profit stakeholders, professionals from many disciplines, and citizens, all working together over time to improve the population\u2019s health and the living conditions in the community.\u201d As a domain of public policy, this field encompasses a stunning range of policy problems, draws on the full array of biomedical, behavioral and social sciences, and has an increasingly global reach. This course will focus on the range of interventions and essential services provided by public health, the \u201ctools\u201d of public health. These include the collection and use of health data for public health purposes (\u201csurveillance\u201d in in the vocabulary of public health practitioners); immunization, using human papillomavirus vaccine and a measles outbreak as case studies; mandated treatment, using tuberculosis as a case study; screening and behavioral interventions, using HIV/AIDS as a case study; persuasion and social marketing, including media campaigns, using various communications designed to reduce obesity as vehicles for testing the ethical and legal constraints on \u201cgovernment speech\u201d aiming to promote health; regulation of advertising and labeling, using tobacco as a case study; environmental health regulation, using fluoride, residential lead poisoning and firearm access as case studies; and product regulation, using ready-to-eat packaged foods, motor vehicle airbags and e-cigarettes as case studies; and environmental health regulation, using fluoride, residential lead poisoning and firearm access as case studies"

Using the lens of leading international anti-corruption conventions pertaining to preventive measures, criminalization, international cooperation, and asset recovery, this course will explore the meaning, causes, and consequences of corruption; corruption in action in public procurement and various industries; examples of domestic-corruption offenses and enforcement measures; the relationship between corruption, money laundering, kleptocracy, and beneficial ownership transparency; and private-sector anti-corruption ethics and compliance programs. It will emphasize current information and issues of concern in the practice of anti-corruption law, and will periodically feature speakers from government, law firms, and non-profit entities. As this is a practicum course, the principal project in which students will participate is the drafting of written guidance, in the form of one or more white papers, for the Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE).

The course will therefore use Sudan, and the anti-corruption issues it presents, as a recurring point of reference and discussion in multiple classes, including development and drafting of the written guidance.
