Early modern print media was revolutionary: suddenly, members of diverse socio-economic spheres could acquire information, cross distances virtually, and engage with societies unknown. As a technological leap, print outstripped the laws and social norms attempting to restrain the medium, and fostered new generations of artists and realms of visual discourse. This class explores print across Europe and colonial space. Students will gain first-hand knowledge of the various forms of print media through regular visits to the Wellin Museum collection. Overall, this course explores how information\u2014in the form of visual print media\u2014changed the world."

Students will engage with ancient literary, archaeological, and epigraphic evidence from the city of Rome, and consider modern developments in the study of migrancy and its realities throughout."

Christians in antiquity also asked these questions in response to persecution under the Roman Empire, as well as in the centuries after. Others in antiquity too considered the difference between suicide and noble, voluntary death. We will analyze the phenomenon of martyrdom in antiquity through a variety of textual attestation."

And third, we will then use those research methods to evaluate realist, liberal, and leader-centric theories against case material provided by the life history of Vladimir Putin, Russian-American relations, and several of the wars that Russia has been involved in during the Putin presidency."

This course covers a variety of domains, such as short story, theatre, novel, and visual arts."

But what the body means, and how we relate to our bodies is more than a matter of biology, or personal experience. This course argues how we inhabit our bodies is fundamentally social and cultural, and draws on studies of Indian history and society to make its case. We reflect on how gender, sexuality, religion, illness, race, and work are situated within specific relations of power and ideals of personhood. We challenge the notion of an individually bounded, discrete body, and we ask how is the cultural diversity of bodies meaningful in an increasingly global society?"

While their behavior often violates conventional social norms, Tricksters can have liberative effects, as they dramatize imaginative ways of perceiving and acting as a good relative. In this class, we will attend to both difference and similarity through careful, discrete comparative analysis across American Indian traditions. Making use of intercultural oral and written stories, we examine the paradoxical role of Tricksters as guides and teachers, whose buffoonery can sometimes obscure their powerful, creative, life-affirming lessons."

We will critically engage theory surrounding the modern prison, gendered origins of the modern prison, and how marginalized persons have been targeted by the mass incarceration machine, yet rendered invisible in discussions on imprisonment. Students will read from scholars, activists, and formerly incarcerated persons alike to gain multiple perspectives on our imprisonment crisis. Ultimately, students will leave this course with a profound understanding of jails, prisons, and other forms of confinement. We will end the course addressing the potential for and feasibility of alternative solutions to incarceration."

You will be grounded in interdisciplinary understandings of time, particularly pulling from sociology, anthropology, philosophy, and feminist literature. We will explore how the clock came to dominate our modern world and the hegemony of western time. We will look at alternative understandings and social orderings of time. We will look at how time is a marker and maker of difference and how time is racialized, gendered, classed, etc. We will study how time is experienced in disjunction with the clock and how we attempt to manipulate time in given spaces. We will look at unique and telling experiences of time, such as imprisonment, terminal illness, and waiting in general.

        "course_description": "How are gender and sexuality figured in contemporary visual culture? This course seeks answers in the work of (women) filmmakers with South Asian and Iranian ties, including Ana Lily Amanpour (A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night [2014]), Gurinder Chadha (Bend It Like Beckham [2002]), Samira Makhmalbaf (Blackboards [2009]), and Sabiha Sumar (Silent Waters [2003]). Spanning national and regional borders, it examines contextual and formal challenges artists navigate as they probe the complexity of gendered lives. It asks how notions of gender, sexuality, and nation shape film form, and how form might be used to think anew about such social structures."
