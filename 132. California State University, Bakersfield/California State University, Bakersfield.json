In particular, it will examine the relationships between race, class, gender and digital technology, and question how digital media serves to complicate, diversify, deconstruct and recreate cultural and social boundaries in the understanding of race, class, and gender, as well as, how concepts of race, class and gender are embodied in digital technologies. Students will examine tensions, anxieties and conflicts around race, class, gender, technology, and hegemonic culture, as well as the possibilities for alternative identities, communities, and cultures that digital technology offers. Students will create scholarly multimedia projects to express, reflect, and analyze their own attitudes on the issues of race, class, and gender in digital culture, and consider how living in a diverse society can function as a form of social and cultural enrichment. Further, this course will examine the ways in which race and ethnicity have shaped debates about politics, power, and digital technologies. Lastly, this course will emphasize how historically oppressed peoples use digital media to build community and struggle for social justice."

Through diverse and insightful readings, screenings of selected films, and discussion and analyses of the films, students will gain meaningful insight into the representations of gender and race in the art of fear and its connection to our understanding of culture at large. There will be a special focus on African American and Latino horror films to help further examine the theoretical frameworks of gender, race, socio-economic class, sexuality, and other issues in society and culture. How does real-life horror and fictional horror reflect society and culture? How is popular culture used to reinforce and dispel stereotypes as well as subjective/objective beliefs/ideas in society? Lastly, students will be taught how to read, critique, and write about film and literature."

Today, both major political parties in the U.S. have many neoliberal adherents as this political and cultural thinking has become pervasive. Critics of this ideology argue that it has had a deleterious effect on the well-being of people of color and poor people across the country, often pointing to the removal of funding for public programs aimed at helping these communities as well as to the way in which free trade agreements have led to restrictive and draconian migration policies and practices. Supporters of neoliberalism point to individual success stories and a legally protected \u00bfcolor-blind\u00bf meritocracy as proof of a triumphant ideology. In this course, we examine the processes by which neoliberalism came to prevail and is maintained in the U.S. as well as the political, economic, and cultural discourse that has emerged since its introduction. Special attention is given to how these policies and ideologies have impacted communities of color and how these communities have responded."

In this course, we critically evaluate the role of religion in politics. We will examine how religion has impacted American political leadership, policy, elections, government institutions, and legal outcomes.  In doing so, we analyze the roles of both civil and traditional religion in America's ever- increasing pluralistic society.  We analyze how, when, and if religion and politics should mix and the impact and consequences on the democratic process.  Furthermore, students will examine how increased religious pluralism has revolutionized how religion is thought about in this country and its implication for social and political outcomes. In this course, we will also discuss survey research regarding individuals and religious organizations within the United States and how religion shapes their political identity and behavior.  We also consider how race, minority religious groups, and female leadership in faith traditions brings forth tension between personal and institutional authority and how this dynamic impacts issues of political influence among the laity.  Overall, this course provides an examination of various theories of religion and politics, its influence, limitations, challenges, and impact on the American political system.

The course will examine the interactions of these groups as part of the broader history of colonial North America. (Americas/Empires/pre-1700)"

We will study the roots and origins of this conflict, the war itself, and the Reconstruction era that followed. The course is roughly divided into three portions. In the first portion we will examine the coming of the war. The second portion will deal with the course of the war, and the third portion of the course will deal with Reconstruction.

Alongside our exploration of the Cold War in Asia's hot wars, diplomatic exchanges, and seminal events, we will consider a set of ideas central to the Cold War as an everyday, lived experience for ordinary people in Asia - among them, anti-colonialism, decolonization, race, postcolonial development, modernization, and nationalism. In addition to reading scholarly analyses of the period, we will examine a number of primary sources demonstrating the Cold War's extensive reach into everyday Asian life, including dramatic plays, comic books, and letters.

We will see how processes occurring at plate boundaries and hotspots result in the dramatic landscapes seen in national parks. We will also introduce other geologic concepts such as types of rocks, geologic time, and the record of Earth history and change recorded in rocks using examples from national parks. These tools allow us to understand why landscapes and rocks in a given park are similar to those in some parks yet differ from those in others; and to appreciate why the preservation of geologic features within national parks helps us understand natural science and how it relates to society and the environment.

Lastly, we analyze the dysfunctional U.S. immigration regime in the post-cold-war era, from the mid-1990s up to the present, including ever-more draconian and restrictive laws, the intense nativist backlash, the rise of the modern immigrant rights movement and the impact on immigrant communities, immigrant flows, and immigration politics and reform, by the rise of the homeland security state after 9/11 (Gonzales's book).
