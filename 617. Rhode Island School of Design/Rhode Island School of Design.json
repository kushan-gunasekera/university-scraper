The student will first focus on normal blood cell development (hematopoiesis), then normal cell function, leading into abnormal function and the pathogenesis of hematological disorders. The course emphasis is on recognition of normal and abnormal laboratory results and interpretation of clinical data used in the diagnostic process. The course is broken down into four main sections: starting with an overview of the clinical hematology laboratory and hematopoiesis; then erythropoiesis and disorders primarily involving red cells; followed by normal leukopoiesis, non-malignant leukocytes, and related disorders; and lastly the study of malignant leukocyte disorders and platelets.\nStudents will describe and analyze the process of Hematopoiesis. Disciplinary writing will be employed to produce case studies, written reports and analyze theory of hematology procedures. Application of course concepts will be used to enumerate and identify blood cells. Emphasis will be placed on the identification and description of detection of abnormalities and on the demonstration of special equipment and techniques.\nThe proposed Student Learning Outcomes (SLO) are as follows.\n1.\nDemonstrate the ability to perform clinical diagnostic testing, evaluate outcomes, and generate a written report in order to solve problems related to pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical components of services in the clinical laboratory.\n2.\nEmploy health professional discourse and proper medical terminology to facilitate communication on laboratory findings pertaining to hematology.\n3.\nIdentify, read, and interpret published studies in clinical hematology in order to describe, evaluate, and report the clinical laboratory findings.\n4.\nIdentify and analyze the principles of hematology and generate written reports that address laboratory findings.\n5.\nCommunicate effectively about hematology across medical professions, including physician, nursing, and other specializations."
