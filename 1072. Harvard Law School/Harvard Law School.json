Lawyering promises to be a concrete method of social justice problem solving, a set of tools the lawyer can use to make a positive difference. But what does it really look like to \"lawyer for justice\"? The strategies and tactics of public interest lawyers vary widely depending on their clients, their causes, their geography, and their own interests, talents, and expertise. How do you decide how to lawyer? What tools in the lawyer's toolkit are best suited to your task? And what are the limits on the lawyer's role? How do lawyers situate themselves in the ecosystem of change agents, offering their unique skills (and credentials) while making space to learn and benefit from other voices and methodologies?</p> <p>This course will help first-year students explore these foundational questions through interactive sessions led by experienced practitioners teaching and lawyering in the HLS clinical programs and their community partners. Each day, a clinical teacher working on a different social justice problem - immigration, predatory lending, human rights, criminal justice, education, housing, building a solidarity economy, and more - will share their thoughts on what it means to lawyer for justice and will lead students through discussions and exercises that offer first-hand experience on a wide range of lawyering dilemmas and approaches. Collectively, the sessions will cover a diverse set of lawyering techniques, including impact litigation, legislative and policy advocacy, transactional work, community lawyering, system mapping, and the representation of individuals in proceedings in unjust systems. The course will end with \"Action Day,\" a day-long showcase in which students present creative projects to the class that highlight potential legal pathways for addressing one or more contemporary justice problems.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> There will be days throughout the winter term that require attendance beyond the regularly scheduled times.

Partisan advocates on either side of an issue present evidence to a neutral arbiter - usually a jury, which, in turn acts as a finder of fact. An impartial judge decides matters of law and manages the trial process.</p> <p>Trial Advocacy is both art and science. At bottom, an effective advocate paints a word picture of an historical event for strangers who were not percipient witnesses to the disputed event. Creating a compelling narrative is an art, which through study and practice, can be developed and mastered. The technique and structure of examinations, statements, and argument is in form similar to a science. It is tried and true method, which through study and practice, can be developed and mastered.</p> <p>This course is an introduction to effective advocacy. It focuses on predicate areas of advocacy not traditionally covered in trial advocacy courses. ITA begins with a study of case theory. Case theory, as the phrase suggests, represents the narrative an advocate advances to persuade a fact finder to accept the advocate's narrative. The course then moves to lawyer-client interaction, including the initial interview, and the thorny ethical issues that relationship may, on occasion, entail. Finally, the course teaches two of the most important tools in the trial lawyer's toolkit, direct and cross examination. </p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> There may be days throughout the winter term that require attendance beyond the scheduled times.

This course is designed to be fully accessible to those with no prior quantitative training or background in the subjects covered.</p> <p><strong>Exam Type: </strong> In Class</p> <p>Lawyers in almost every area of practice (litigation, corporate, government, public interest) deal routinely with problems that are usefully illuminated by basic business and economic concepts. This course is designed to teach the most important analytical methods to law students, in a manner that will be fully accessible to those with no prior quantitative training or background in the subjects covered. Using text, classroom activities, and written exercises, we will explore how these tools may be used to analyze concrete problems that arise in a wide range of legal practice settings. The course will consist of seven units:</p> <p><em>1. Decision Analysis, Games and Information:</em> Lawyers assist their clients in making a wide variety of decisions, ranging from the settlement of lawsuits to the purchase of property. We will explore a standard technique that has been developed to organize thinking about decision-making problems and to solve them. We will also consider strategic interactions between parties and considerations related to imperfect information.</p> <p><em>2. Contracting:</em> Lawyers write many contracts, concerning such matters as acquisitions of land or corporations, creation of partnerships and nonprofit entities, settlement of lawsuits, financing arrangements, and government procurement. This unit presents practical principles concerning what issues should be addressed in contracts and how they might best be resolved.</p> <p><em>3. Accounting:</em> Lawyers who counsel clients in conducting their affairs or who represent them in litigation must understand the parties' financial circumstances and dealings, which often are represented in financial statements. Basic accounting concepts will be introduced, and the relationship between accounting information and economic reality will be examined.</p> <p><em>4. Finance:</em> Legal advice in business transactions, division of assets upon divorce, litigation, and many other matters require knowledge of valuation, assessment of financial risk, and comprehension of the relationships between those who provide financing and those who need it. We will consider basic principles of finance, such as present value, the tradeoff between risk and return, the importance of diversification, and basic methods for valuing financial assets.</p> <p><em>5. Microeconomics:</em> Lawyers need to understand their clients' and other parties' economic situations and opportunities as well as the principles that underlie many of the rules of our legal system. This unit presents basic economic concepts-the operation of competitive markets, imperfect competition, and market failures-that are necessary to this understanding.</p> <p><em>6. Law and Economics:</em> Legal rules have important effects on clients' interests, which must be appreciated by lawyers who advise them and by judges, regulators, and legislators who formulate legal rules. We will explore these effects using the economic approach to law, with illustrations from torts, contracts, property, law enforcement, and legal procedure.</p> <p><em>7. Statistics:</em> Legal matters increasingly involve the use of statistics in business contexts, in the promulgation of government regulations, in the measurement of damages, in attempts to make inferences concerning parties' behavior (such as those regarding discrimination in employment), and in determination of causation (in tort, contract, and other disputes). We will address the basic statistical methods, including regression analysis, as well as issues that commonly arise when statistics are used in the courtroom.</p>"

We begin by asking whether federal regulation of insolvency is necessary. Are state laws inadequate for dealing with the financial distress of individuals and businesses? As we consider this question, we will develop a set of policies that optimal bankruptcy law should serve. These policies will help frame our discussion as we study the principal provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, such as the automatic stay, claim valuation, strong-arm powers, absolute priority rule, and cram-down. We will ask whether these provisions serve optimal bankruptcy policy. Although we will emphasize corporate reorganization, most of the Code's provisions apply equally to corporate and consumer bankruptcies. This class is highly recommended for anyone who intends to have a career working on the legal problems of businesses, whether on the transactional side or in litigation. </p>"

In recent years, a robust debate has emerged around the challenge of extending human rights norms to corporate actors. Historically, human rights advocates have focused on state actors, but as the reach and influence of private actors and companies has grown, their impact on human rights has become impossible to ignore. Today, the human rights movement has squarely engaged the private sector, marking a critical shift and raising a host of issues for practitioners.</p> <p>The field of business and human rights now touches on a dizzying array of policy and legal areas, including company due diligence standards, judicial and non-judicial grievance mechanisms, relations between businesses and communities, extraterritorial application of domestic laws, supply chain systems, and whether there should be an international human rights treaty to regulate the conduct of corporations. The field now also includes a growing body of domestic and international standards and mechanisms, which are helping to define these policy and legal arenas as well as the precise scope of corporate human rights obligations.</p> <p>The seminar will focus on community-centric approaches to business and human rights, and efforts to elevate community power and incorporate them into current legal and policy frameworks and legislation as well as company community engagement policies. The class will give students an opportunity to work with practitioners experimenting with current live problems in the field, including emerging due diligence standards. Throughout the seminar, students will work collaboratively in teams to explore such problems in particular contexts, while also reflecting on the implications of the issues for the field of business and human rights more generally. </p> <p>A limited number of seats in the seminar are reserved for clinical students enrolled in the Human Rights Entrepreneurs and Incubator Clinic, which gives students the opportunity to work in a lab-like atmosphere to support entrepreneurs in start-ups as well as innovators within existing organizations as they translate their ideas for change into reality.</p>"

We will, for example, take up the varying foundations and structures of judicial review of the constitutionality of laws (e.g., how are courts that engage in constitutional review structured, how are their judges appointed, what is the source of their authority to engage in constitutional review), in light of recent controversies (including those involving the environment). We will also likely consider various constitutional approaches to addressing emergencies and emergency powers, as well as constitutional law regulating the availability of abortion in selected jurisdictions (including the United States, Germany, Canada, Colombia, and Ireland). The course will consider the meanings of terms like &ldquo;constitution&rdquo; and &ldquo;constitutionalism,&rdquo; &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; and &ldquo;authoritarian,&rdquo; as well as the purposes and nature of legal comparison.

First, we will be trying to improve our capacities to think systematically about constitutions, different structures for organizing governments and establishing just and efficacious governments, and about the role of constitutional law, constitutional rights, and courts.&nbsp;Second, we will critically examine the nature of comparative study, asking, can one draw conclusions for one country based on comparing constitutional experiences in others?

Income inequality accelerated during the pandemic. A growing category of people - \"gig workers\" - don't even know if they have an employer. The right to unionize has been eviscerated. In the face of these trends, how can working people organize and mobilize for economic justice? And what does the law do to enable or impede their efforts? A new generation of leaders is experimenting with innovative ways to enable workers to gain power in their workplaces, our communities and the economy. This course will explore the legal framework and challenges for these new organizations and movements, analyze their potential in achieving the scale and sustainability necessary to make lasting change, and challenge students to predict how the law can and should evolve to meet the needs of the next generation of American workers.</p>"

Although employers have great latitude when making employment decisions under common law, a variety of statutes regulate decisions that are based on protected characteristics, such as race, gender, age, religion, national origin, or disability. On the federal level, those statutes include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Equal Pay Act, the Family & Medical Leave Act, and more. Over time, those statutory protections have been subject to constant review and revision, both by courts called upon to resolve conflicting values and norms and by legislatures responding to competing political pressures. In studying core aspects of the doctrine that have remained relatively stable, as well as aspects that have changed over time, we will examine the forces that have influenced the ongoing development of this area of law. The course will cover various topics related to rights and procedures, including the increased prevalence of mandatory arbitration agreements and the role of class action litigation.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This course will be taught in an accelerated manner, starting on January 25.</p>"

These judgments include the evidence supplied by our senses (such as, seeing that the sky is cloudy as evidence of actual or likely rain) as well as the evidence supplied by our reasoning faculties (such as, advice from experts as evidence regarding risks we face and steps we can take to prevent harms to ourselves and others). Lawyers and judges also constantly make judgments about evidence when they assess the applicability of legal rules to the facts of cases, which of course involves determining what exactly those facts are. American legal systems have developed Evidence law, a distinct set of rules, policies, and procedures that guide legal factfinders (lawyers, judges, and juries) in their judgments about what factual claims are taken to be sufficiently proven for the purposes of civil and criminal litigation -- for depriving civil or criminal litigants of property, liberty, or life. In this course we study the rules, policies, and institutions of Evidence law, with a cohering focus on the argument practices of trial and appellate lawyers and judges under that law. We will be attentive to the illuminating and clarifying connections among legal arguments under rules of Evidence and the many other ways in which we make arguments that rely on evidence outside of the legal setting. </p> <p>The course focuses on federal law (the Federal Rules of Evidence and cases interpreting them) but also covers selected state rules and cases. Topics include: presumptions and standards of proof and persuasion, judicial notice, relevance, privileges, authentication and best evidence rules, hearsay, lay, expert, and scientific expert evidence, examination and impeachment of witnesses, habit and character evidence, and some of the constitutional questions that arise in connection with rules of evidence. Our approach in this class is informed by the Logocratic Method, a special method of understanding and mastering the strengths and weakness of arguments, which law students, lawyers, and judges around the world have found to be a valuable way to master Evidence and other legal doctrines. Course work consists of regular class attendance and participation, and an in-class final exam.</p> <p>Evidence is a recommended prerequisite for the Trial Advocacy Workshop and can be used as the basis for certification to practice in conjunction with some of the HLS clinical offerings.</p>"

Global governance refers to the capacity within the international system to provide services and public goods. But to get to that point, global governance also must involve framing new issues, setting agendas, creating norms, building capacity, setting standards, and resolving disputes. Our cases are drawn from a broad range of issue areas, including health challenges such as COVID-19, economic relations, human rights, peace and security issues, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the environment. The objective is to better understand the dynamics and evolution of formal and informal global governance arrangements and what difference they make. In major case in the class, for example, we will try to understand why there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t better or more global governance in response to the Coronavirus? The course uses cases, role-playing, and simulations to help students learn how to work with international law to promote global justice.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This course is jointly-listed with HKS as IGA-103. It will meet on the HKS campus and scheduling will adhere to the HKS Academic Calendar. The first day of the fall semester at HKS is Wednesday, August 30, 2023.</p>"

As companies and investors become increasingly involved in international business transactions, the practice of arbitration is rapidly growing apace in law firms of every size. The practice is peripatetic and global with many international arbitration lawyers basing themselves in law firms in New York, Washington D.C., Paris, Hong Kong, Singapore, and other major commercial centers, and appearing in proceedings in their home cities and throughout the world.</p> <p>The course will examine arbitration law and practice from a comparative, multi-jurisdictional perspective. At the same time, it will also address in depth the United States law of international commercial arbitration. Students can expect to review both commentaries, statutes and case law on the subject. The course is comprised of five main topics: (1) an introduction to the field of international commercial arbitration; (2) the agreement to arbitrate; (3) the selection and role of the arbitrators; (4) the arbitration process; and (5) the arbitral award. The role of national courts in the process will also be examined.</p> <p>The course will also address new developments in international arbitration in relation to how technology is impacting the practice of arbitration and the use of arbitration to the digital economy in both mundane and more exotic applications.</p>"

We will accordingly look at the historical evolution and political role of human rights law and look at institutions and mechanisms, at the global and regional level, for the monitoring and enforcement of human rights law. We will analyze how international law has articulated specific rights, for example the right to life, the prohibition of torture, the rights to food, health, and self-determination. We will discuss how human rights relate to specific contexts and themes, for example migration, war, climate change, corporations, poverty, race. We will aim to identify to what extent international human rights law may be useful in addressing (global) inequality.

It will not be a march through the evolution of legal doctrines, though we will discuss the development of various doctrines. \"Law\", for our purposes, is broadly defined to include, among other things, the structure of the government that was created after the Revolution, statutory and common law, and customs. We will proceed in rough chronology, deviating when it makes sense to do so.</p> <p>In history, context is all. To understand the development of any country's legal system, one must know something of the people (powerful and not), the society, and culture in which that system came into being. This is necessarily, then, a course in American history. If context is critical to historical study, recognizing the role of contingency must also guide our consideration. Things did not always have to happen the way they happened. With that in mind, we can say that the creation of the United States turns out to have been a pivotal moment in the history of the world. We are going to consider the choices made when creating the American Republic as a nation of laws from the 1770s to the 1860s. Many of those choices helped to shape American identities, and resonate to this day. It will be fun, and instructive, to consider how it all unfolded.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This course is jointly-listed with FAS as History 1405.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> None</p> <p><strong>Exam Type:</strong> No Exam</p> <p>The course will focus on the rapidly-changing legal system that is designed to regulate government ethics. The course will allow students to explore the legal and associated challenges for lawyers who represent clients in ethics-related matters, as well as for lawyers in the government who are charged with applying these complex and onerous rules to federal employees.</p> <p>Over the past few years, numerous ethics-related scandals have led to a substantial overhaul of federal ethics law for all three branches of government, with the result that government employees are now subject to more stringent ethical restrictions than they have been in the past. At the same time, growing media scrutiny has made the reputational consequences to individuals and companies caught up in ethics scandals exceptionally severe, even in cases where no legal violation is ultimately established. Providing effective counsel to public sector and private sector clients thus increasingly requires an appreciation of both the legal and non-legal dimensions of ethics-related representations.</p> <p>The course will concentrate primarily on the ethics rules that apply to individuals appointed to or serving in Executive Branch positions, although comparisons with rules in the other Branches will be addressed. The course will follow the timeline for appointees from initial selection to Senate confirmation, and will use case studies from recent administrations. The course will analyze the legal and practical questions that lawyers must address at each stage of government service, from initial appointment to departure from office. The course will also examine the ethics issues that arise for appointees upon their return to the private sector.</p> <p>The course will involve readings from a wide range of sources; examination of a number of case studies; analysis of statutes, regulations and case law; and discussion of various approaches to the regulation of ethical behavior by government officials. Students will be expected to become familiar with the principal rules and authorities and with the basic tools used to regulate ethical behavior of government officials and with the role of the lawyer - both in the government and in the private sector - in the representation of parties involved in the system of government ethics.</p> <p>Instead of an exam, a final paper, based upon essay topics selected by the instructors, will be required.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This course is primarily available to JD 3Ls and LLM students.

This subject matter is also the concern of politics, which upholds or transforms social assumptions and arrangements.</p> <p>Today, however, we lack a way of thinking about the institutional and ideological structure of society, expressed in law: what it is, how it is made, how we can change it, and what it should become. Legal thought has been part of this evasion of structural insight and ambition.</p> <p>In this seminar, we will deal with this concern in many of its expressions. Each participant in the seminar will work with the instructor to develop a writing project, and each will discuss that project with the class during the semester.</p> <p>Among the problems that we may discuss are the following:</p> <ul> <li>The nature, consequence, limits and alternative futures of the now standard practice of legal analysis, which represents law in the language of impersonal policy and principle.</li> </ul> <ul start=\"2\"> <li>The relation of this analytic and argumentative practice to the shape of political-economic debate in the United States and other contemporary societies. What a jurisprudence useful to the overcoming of neoliberalism and of institutionally conservative social democracy would look like.</li> </ul> <ul start=\"3\"> <li>The uses of a revised practice of legal analysis in the development of institutional and ideological alternatives for these societies. Legal thought as institutional imagination, and its relation to legal thought as an instrument for adjudicating disputes about rights and their violation.</li> </ul> <ul start=\"4\"> <li>The existing and possible ways in which lawyers, jurists, courts, the legislative and executive branches, and the citizenry can relate to one another, and create such alternatives.</li> </ul> <ul start=\"5\"> <li>What legal history and comparative law can teach us about the evasion of structural insight and the achievement of structural change.</li> </ul> <ul start=\"6\"> <li>The relation of this agenda in jurisprudence to major developments and possibilities in economic, political, and social theory.</li> </ul>"

Recent major prosecutions of corporations and individuals for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) demonstrate that this is an increasing area of enforcement in the United States. Yet, the practice of prosecuting and defending corporations remains one of the least understood areas of criminal law. Decisions on how to charge and sanction corporations are subject to policies set by the U.S. Department of Justice. Moreover, such matters are becoming increasingly complex as foreign law enforcement and regulatory agencies become more active in focusing on these corporate crimes. These multi-jurisdictional investigations pose new obstacles to government enforcers and defense practitioners, and new legal questions for courts to address.</p> <p>This seminar will explore various aspects of corporate criminal investigations and prosecutions. Topics to be covered include principles of corporate liability; conducting internal and government investigations of corporate misconduct; strategic considerations for prosecutors and defense counsel in corporate criminal investigations; Department of Justice policies on charging, including those designed to incentivize voluntary disclosures, cooperation and remediation; legal and practical issues implicated by multi-jurisdictional cases; corporate compliance programs; and proposals for reform of corporate criminal laws and policies.</p>"

But unlike domestic inequality, there is less policy discussions and little concerted international action to tackle global inequality, notwithstanding the enormous differences in wealth and resources between rich and poor nations. This course explores past and present international legal ideas and policy proposals to redistribute resources and burdens from north to south. </p> <p>The international legal order does not recognize redistributive obligations between nations. States from the global north have consistently opposed the recognition of concrete duties of international cooperation, from opposition to the International Seabed Authority redistributing resources from seabed mining, to opposition against a tax on transnational financial transactions, and against a Global Health Treaty pulling resources to finance R&D on neglected tropical diseases. We will study these and other examples and focus on controversies between north and south on the redistributive dimension of international regulation, like the clash between the 'common but differentiated responsibility' principle and individual pledges in climate change. We will finally study a number of redistributive initiatives from the global south, from the 1970s New International Economic Order's international commodity agreements, regarding coffee and sugar, to the obligation to transfer technology in the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty and the Law of the Sea, to contemporary challenges by Latin-American states to the U.N international drug control regime.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This seminar will be taught over four weeks, tentative dates below:<ul> <li>January: 29-30-31</li> <li>February: 5-6-7</li> <li>March: 25-26-27</li> <li>April: 1-2-3</li> </ul></p>"

As one scholar put it, the pharmaceutical industry is now \"in tobacco-land in terms of how much people hate it,\" and drug product liability litigation is a \"growth industry.\" This course, which will be taught by a practitioner with 25 years of experience trying such cases, will consider the theory and practice of such litigation before and after the Supreme Court's landmark decision in <em>Wyeth v. Levine.</em></p> <p>At the outset, we will focus on the similarities and differences between pharma cases and other product liability cases, using the \"Phen-Fen\" (Diet Drug) cases tried by the instructor as a model, and on the special context of FDA regulation. We will then consider the legal doctrines governing such lawsuits, such as \"failure to test\"; inadequate warning; learned intermediary; medical causation; and various forms of damages. We will discuss these issues both in their classic formulations in a single lawsuit, but also in the way those principles are applied in the context of a mass pharmaceutical litigation where there may be several thousand individual claimants and multiple jury trials.</p> <p>The course will also consider the practical application of these doctrines, including the special evidentiary problems when doctors are witnesses; discovery tactics where regulatory agencies are involved; techniques to present complex scientific material to juries; approaches to trial examination; jury selection strategies; and the problems in structuring mass tort settlements.

It affects the lives of millions, unsettles established governments, creates sharply polarizing policy dilemmas and generates far-reaching administrative, economic and political challenges. This course will focus on distress migration, including refugee flight and other forms of forced displacement, evaluated through the lens of human rights. It will address the multifaceted drivers of the phenomenon, including the enduring legacies of colonization, armed conflict, environmental stress and climate change, global inequality, demographic pressures and increasing globalization. The course will also consider the impact of government responses to the COVID 19 pandemic on forced migrants. Migration actors from UN agencies, NGOs and other civil society organizations, and research experts working in a range of field sites will contribute to the class.</p> <p>The course will address the legal frameworks governing migration, and the ethical and pragmatic considerations that influence policies. It will explore the viability of a range of solutions to current migration challenges, including unequal access to protection, the failure of equitable resettlement and the erosion of host empathy/solidarity. The extent to which pandemic related measures conform to or violate legal and ethical obligations will also be considered. A key goal is to enable students to analyze current migration situations with clarity and rigor concerning the obligations of states and the rights of migrants. Using examples of large-scale contemporary population movements \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Ukrainian war and its human impact, the ongoing Tigrayan emergency, the Rohingya exodus, the Venezuelan context, the Mediterranean migration situation, extensive intra-regional mobility within the African continent, US/Mexico/Central American movements, unaccompanied child migration in many regions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the course will examine migration drivers, policy responses and rights challenges such as exclusion and denial of protection, persistent racism in border control, detention, prolonged confinement within refugee camps and forced repatriation. It will also engage with the multiple risks, including statelessness, trafficking, drowning, sexual violence, that migrants face before, during and after their journeys. The course will cover key current policy developments, at the municipal, national, regional and international level, including the impact of Global Compacts on Refugees and on Migration. The course will discuss seasonal migration, child migration, undocumented and irregular status, gender factors in migration and the role of xenophobia in driving policy. Students will be required to make in class presentations, to prepare questions for guest lecturers, and encouraged to participate in class discussion, including by to considering a range of strategies for increasing access to safe mobility as a key redistributive global good.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This course is jointly-listed with HKS as IGA-355.

The course considers each stage of the appellate litigation process beginning with a general overview, moving to the various bases for appellate jurisdiction in the federal courts, then discussing standards of review, and concluding with an intense review of the anatomy of an appellate brief. We will also briefly consider U.S. Supreme Court practice. Students considering clerkships, particularly appellate clerkships, after graduation generally find this course useful.</p> <p>There are about a half dozen small-to-medium-sized writing assignments, which have two purposes: They introduce students to an aspect of appellate practice, and they demand application of one or more of the course&rsquo;s doctrinal topics. In addition to these smaller assignments, students are also responsible for writing an appellate brief. For all assignments, students are provided copies of relevant practice rules, statutes, cases, and other items. No outside research is involved.</p> <p>The doctrinal portion of the course and the corresponding small-to-medium-sized writing assignments will be covered during the first two weeks of the January Term. The appellate brief will be completed early in the Spring Term.

Incorporating varying perspectives, the seminar discusses federal and state policy options to address current health and public challenges.</p> <p>This seminar begins with an analysis of health systems in other countries. Next, we discuss the key policy decisions that have shaped the current patchwork of public and private insurance coverage options in this country. After providing this international and historical context, we analyze in detail the key elements of the current U.S. health and public health care systems through the lens of its impact on vulnerable populations. We look at the components of the federal approach to reform, including the national health care reform law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. We also consider several state initiatives that highlight how states are acting as laboratories of innovation to implement sweeping health and public health reforms. Finally, we discuss the current health law and policy climate in this country and explore both the opportunities and challenges for health policy solutions focused on increasing access to care and addressing public health concerns.</p> <p>This seminar is open to students interested in health and public health law and policy; no background or prerequisites are required. The reading materials include various book chapters, cases, news reports, and scholarly articles that present diverse viewpoints on the topics presented. The course employs experiential learning techniques, such as role plays, simulations, and discussion posts to spark debate between different sides of often controversial issues. Over the course of a semester, students gain a wealth of hands-on experience in current and emerging health law and policy issues, produce a written policy paper, and develop a range of problem-solving, policy analysis, research and writing, oral communication, advocacy and leadership skills.</p> <p>This course satisfies the clinical seminar requirement for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://chlpi.org/health-law-and-policy/\">Health Law & Policy Clinic.</a> The drop deadline for students enrolled in this course in a clinical seat is December 8, 2023.</p> <p>To learn more about the Clinical Curriculum and Registration, please visit our <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hls.harvard.edu/clinical-policies-and-registration/clinical-registration-center/\">Clinical Registration Center.</a></strong><br> You can also find more information on <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hls.harvard.edu/clinical-policies-and-registration/how-to-register-for-clinics/\">How to Register for Clinics</a></strong> and <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hls.harvard.edu/clinical-policies-and-registration/clinical-credits/\">How Clinical Credits Work.</a></strong></p>"

Some of the cases will be current cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Others may have you sitting as a state supreme court deciding an issue of statutory interpretation or common law. We will discuss each case and one student will be assigned to write a proposed majority opinion for that case. After circulating that opinion, other students can write concurring and dissenting opinions and we will discuss the case a second time, using those written opinions as the basis for discussion.

Of particular emphasis is the role of the state courts in protecting liberty and property rights under their own constitutions, and most notably whether they should construe these guarantees to offer protections that the federal courts have not provided in construing the federal constitution. Examples include litigation involving school funding, marriage, property takings, criminal procedure, the free exercise of religion, among others. We also will consider the amendment procedures of the state constitutions, the election of state court judges, the non-unitary executive under most state constitutions and other structural issues.</p>"

This clinical seminar will explore ways to advance civilian protection during and after armed conflict. Following an introduction to the costs of conflict and idea of limited war, the course will examine a wide spectrum of strategies, such as naming and shaming, creating new law, victim assistance, diplomacy, peacekeeping, humanitarian intervention, international criminal justice, and protection of the environment and cultural heritage. Students will assess the promises and limitations of each strategy and consider how to determine the most appropriate one for a specific situation.

This course explores what it means to be a human rights advocate, whether one is engaged in debates over U.S. policy at home and abroad, the role of corporations in alleged violations, or the role of rights in times of transitions from conflict. Through case studies and simulations, this seminar examines the various dimensions and limitations of human rights advocacy, including strategic, ethical, and tactical challenges. What are the different ways that human rights can be used? In developing strategies for meaningful change, how do advocates decide which tactics to use and when? The goal is for students to develop core advocacy skills while thinking critically about their work. To that end, the seminar engages seriously with the major critiques and dilemmas faced by human rights advocates, in particular by lawyer-advocates from the Global North. The seminar also grapples with the limits of established approaches of the movement such as litigation, naming and shaming, and explores community lawyering and human rights. How do we engage without perpetuating power differentials along geopolitical, class, race, gender, and other lines? How do we find ways to work in collaboration with directly affected communities and movements? In addition to case studies, students workshop and reflect on their participation in supervised clinical projects, which include fact-finding investigations, media work, negotiations, advocacy, and litigation. Critical reflection will not be the end, but rather the means to find responsible ways of advancing justice.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> None</p> <p><strong>Exam Type:</strong> No Exam</p> <p>Ours is a time fraught with uncertainty about the stability and legitimacy of political and legal institutions and the security of our individual health and that of the planet. To a surprising extent, the human capacity to make, receive, and be convinced by arguments is central to the way we make sense of information about both our individual lives and the world in general. Arguments are also central to the operations of vital domains of life, including politics (think about the political effects of social media), law (think about the contentious issues that come before the Supreme Court as well as who should sit on the Court), and everyday life (think about urgent decisions to be made about public health and personal precaution during a pandemic). This course presents a detailed philosophical examination of arguments and their operation and effects in legal, political, and everyday life. The course framework is the Logocratic Method, a systematic method for understanding the nature of arguments and their principal uses, which can enhance one&apos;s ability both to make and to critique arguments. Although the Logocratic Method applies to arguments in any domain, our principal focus will be on legal and political arguments. From a Logocratic point of view, these tools of analysis are to lawyering and political persuasion as materials engineering is to architecture. One must know the strengths and the weaknesses of the materials from which an edifice is built, and, no less importantly, the different ways in which these materials can be strong or weak, lest it collapse under its own weight -- whether the edifice is a dome atop a cathedral, an argument for plaintiff, prosecutor, or defendant, or an argument for the electability of a candidate or in favor of or in opposition to a legislative policy. Readings are from philosophers, legal and political theorists, as well as from cases, statutes, and political speeches.</p> <p> Although the course introduces and uses some basic techniques from formal logic (familiar to all LSAT-takers!), this course presupposes no background in logic or philosophy. Work for the course consists of class participation and a paper that applies the methods learned in the course to a case or political speech (to be agreed in consultation with the professor). Cross-registrants are welcome. Anyone seeking information about this course should feel free to contact Professor Scott Brewer at sbrewer@law.harvard.edu.</p>"

It then follows with a study of changes in labor law, corporations, and torts as Big Business emerged in the Northeast and Midwest in the late 19th century, shaping of the uniquely weak status of American labor during the &ldquo;Second Industrial Divide,&rdquo; and the network of legal elements governing property, contract, credit, trespass, game, and criminal labor law that laid the foundations for racialized class structure in the post-Reconstruction South. After learning about the rise of Legal Realism in reaction to the judicial imposition of laissez faire at the turn of the 20th century, the heart of the course revolves around the role of law in supporting the emergence of a broad, primarily white middle class from the 1930s to the 1960s, the structuring of racialized class in response to the Great Migration outside of the South, and then since the 1970s, the dismantling of the welfare state, its displacement by mass incarceration and a punitive welfare regime, and changes in the law governing labor, banking, financial regulation, antitrust, corporate governance, and trade that drove the dramatic increase in precarious employment, the stagnation of middle class wages, and the spectacular escape of the 1%, unique to the United States among advanced market society. The course concludes with examination of proposed reforms, and assessment of their likely effectiveness on the background of the experience of regimes within American capitalism covered in the first ten weeks of the course.</p> <p>There is no exam.

Harvard Law School students who satisfy these requirements may enroll by emailing Lauren McCalla at lmccalla@law.harvard.edu by November 17. Other students may enroll only with the permission of the instructor. To seek such permission, please send a resume and an explanation of your interest and qualifications to tfisher@law.harvard.edu by November 17.</p> <p><strong>Exam Type:</strong> No Exam</p> <p>This course is designed for students who are interested in deepening their knowledge of copyright law and gaining experience with law teaching. Each student in the course will be a Teaching Fellow for CopyrightX, an online copyright course taught by Prof. Fisher to roughly 500 students worldwide. The weekly meetings of the course have two functions: to provide an advanced seminar on copyright; and to provide students guidance and support as they learn to teach.</p> <p>CopyrightX closely parallels the HLS course on Copyright. Like the HLS students, the CopyrightX students learn the essential elements of both doctrine and theory by watching videotaped lectures prepared by Prof. Fisher, reading cases and secondary materials, and watching webcast special events in which guest speakers examine controversial current topics. In addition, each CopyrightX student participates in a 25-person seminar led by a Teaching Fellow.</p> <p>Each Teaching Fellow has two primary responsibilities: to conduct each week an 80-minute live online discussion that uses case studies to refine the student's understanding of the pertinent laws and policies; and to draft or revise (at some point during the semester) one case study that will be employed both by Prof. Fisher and by the other Teaching Fellows to facilitate discussions. In addition, the Teaching Fellows will meet once a week with Prof. Fisher to discuss the issues addressed in the lecture and readings for that week and to exchange ideas concerning possible ways of teaching their own seminars. During most weeks, this meeting will be held during one of the time slots allocated to the regular Copyright course. On a few occasions, however, it will meet on a weekday evening.</p> <p>Additional information concerning CopyrightX and the role of the Teaching Fellows can be found by visiting copyx.org or by emailing copyrightx[at]cyber.law.harvard.edu.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> The credit breakdown for this course is as follows: three total credits - two classroom credits and one writing credit.</p>"

We will study the family law embedded in institutions that poor people, because of their poverty, encounter in a much more pervasive and intense way than others do: prisons, immigration, child protection/child welfare/foster care; child delinquency; homeless policy and provision; school discipline; and domestic violence response.&nbsp; Throughout, our focus will be on these materials from a family-eye perspective: how do poor families strategize in the network of law created by all these legal institutions and practices?</p> <p>Readings are interdisciplinary.

We will look critically at efforts to use neuroimaging in court in connection with in the prediction of criminality and predispositions towards mental illness and addiction, as well as efforts to identify neurobiological influences on the brain. Is there such a thing as a criminally violent brain? Does it make sense to speak of the neurobiology of violence or the psychopathology of crime, and how are (or should) such concepts translated into criminal law. The seminar will necessarily lead us to consider the relationship between law and science, more generally, and neuroscience in particular.

The CRPD has, through its near-universal ratification, dramatically raised the standards for how disability human rights are conceived, developed, implemented and adjudicated around the globe. It has also catapulted disability rights onto the development and humanitarian agenda, including state-based aid schemes and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yet many questions remain open regarding how to make it operational around the world. We will consider what effect the CRPD has had on law reform and development (including development aid and humanitarian assistance), as well as what barriers and systemic concerns remain to be addressed. Throughout, we will look at a few specific disabilities (such as Autism) as a way of identifying themes that cross boundaries, cultures, and approaches to realizing disability rights.

We will then examine more closely the legal framework that enabled those policies, including the war on drugs, emphasis on retribution over rehabilitation, the changes in sentencing law and the structure of sentencing decisionmaking. Particular attention will be devoted to substantive sentencing standards (the insights of neuroscience, evidence based lessons from diversion programs) in addition to the procedures governing those decisions. The course will explore different kinds of sentencing regimes-state guideline systems, international models on which sentencing standards have evolved from common law decision making or judge-imposed guidelines (Australia, Israel, England), in addition to the federal sentencing guidelines. We will consider the interplay between principles of proportionality, severity, and parsimony on sentencing law. </p> <p>This course will be divided into two parts: the first part of the term will involve the substantive law of sentencing, and the sociological and historical context in which it evolved as described in the original course description. But the second part of the term will be somewhat unusual. I will invite judges (federal and state), prosecutors, defense lawyers to join the class in addressing particular sentencing issues, with discussions centered around hypothetical cases. All the participants will sentence; they will review the cases, determine the sentences, and discuss them at the class sessions. The issues will be cases involving addiction and drug offenses, mental health, the neuroscience of childhood adversity, juvenile offenders, sex offenders, and issues of race and gender. The idea is not only to look at sentencing at the meta level, but also at the level of the concrete case, which may challenge the generalizations of the sentencing law. </p>"

American health care is broken. We long ago abandoned President Roosevelt's effort to include the right to adequate medical care as among those in a Second Bill of Rights necessary for the security and prosperity of all. The status quo reveals the central importance of rights within our health care system, especially around issues of resource allocation, access to care, and equity. This course will briefly trace the history of the American conception of health care rights through the last half-century of administrative and political cycles. We will contrast a diverse array of ideological perspectives over this progression to understand the context of the current climate.</p> <p>Building on this background, we will consider a broad range of rights-affording sources across the landscape of the modern American health care system: Federal civil rights statutes; the laws and agreements that govern public and private health insurance arrangements; common law duties as between patients, providers and payers; and other state and federal statutes that govern health care consumers, insurers, institutions and spending. We will place congressional and common law health care rights provisions in the broader context of civil rights jurisprudence, including anti-discrimination regimes. We will consider differing avenues available to achieve enforcement of health care rights, including through administrative and policy-based advocacy, as well as more formalized litigation.</p> <p>The seminar is designed to be limited lecture, incorporating debates, role-plays, and other interactive sessions. Class participation is expected. The seminar will culminate in a student project arising from the course materials. Students will have the option of further honing their health care rights skills by participating in the Health Law and Policy Clinic in conjunction with this seminar.</p> <p>The seminar will appeal to law students interested in working across the spectrum of the health care field generally, to those interested in the intersection between law and health care, and to those who aspire to be civil rights lawyers.</p> <p>This course satisfies the clinical seminar requirement for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://chlpi.org/health-law-and-policy\">Health Law & Policy Clinic.</a> The drop deadline for students enrolled in this course in a clinical seat is August 18, 2023.</p> <p>To learn more about the Clinical Curriculum and Registration, please visit our <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hls.harvard.edu/clinical-policies-and-registration/clinical-registration-center/\">Clinical Registration Center.</a></strong><br> You can also find more information on <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hls.harvard.edu/clinical-policies-and-registration/how-to-register-for-clinics/\">How to Register for Clinics</a></strong> and <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hls.harvard.edu/clinical-policies-and-registration/clinical-credits/\">How Clinical Credits Work.</a></strong></p>"

Students will learn to provide effective direct representation to low-income clients in the special education system. The course is organized around a series of hands-on simulations, designed to help students develop the following skills: interviewing and counseling clients; reading and interpreting educational evaluations; preparing and interviewing expert witnesses; identifying substantive and procedural violations; formulating legal arguments and theories of the case; engaging in oral advocacy at the school level and/or in administrative appeals; and interacting and negotiating with opposing counsel. In a typical semester, a hearing officer from the Massachusetts Bureau of Special Education Appeals visits the course and presides over a simulated pre-hearing conference. In addition to building these concrete skills, the course will introduce students to a theoretical orientation that encourages them to see the individual child in a holistic way and to use their developing legal skills to construct compelling narratives and obtain individual remedies that embrace all parts of the child. Students will also learn how to identify systemic problems, assess the education system's response to at-risk children, and reflect on the challenges and rewards of interdisciplinary advocacy at the intersection of the fields of law, education, neurobiology, psychology, and public policy. Students will learn about the impact that traumatic experiences can have on children's learning, behavior and relationships in school and about the ongoing multi-strategic advocacy campaign for safe and supportive school environments that is being conducted by the Trauma and Learning Policy Initiative (TLPI). There is no final examination for this course; students will prepare a \"rounds\" memo and presentation in which they lead a discussion with their colleagues based on their clinic case.&nbsp;</p>"

We will look at how modern human rights litigation started, how it has evolved, how it has changed (and not changed), and where we stand now. We will also think about the future prospects of such litigation in the United States and how it connects to other jurisdictions, including in Canada, Europe, South Africa, and elsewhere.</p> <p>Modern human rights litigation in U.S. courts started in the late 1970s with the resurrection of the Alien Tort Statute (ATS). For many, the ATS has defined U.S.-based human rights litigation for the past forty years, but the litigation landscape has changed significantly during over time. While this seminar will take a close look at the past several decades, this will only be the starting point. The seminar will focus the majority of its time on current approaches to human rights litigation, including innovative test cases and a number of statutes that receive far less attention than the ATS has. In particular, we will look at strategic litigation focused on climate justice and corporate accountability and efforts to develop and incubate new legal theories and cases in these practice areas.</p> <p>The seminar will also give us a chance to connect with day-to-day litigation practice, including the various stages of litigation as well as how litigation fits within broader human rights and climate justice advocacy efforts. Together, we will examine how litigation strategies and techniques have been shared and developed over time and identify common strategies and recurring legal issues that arise across the cases. The seminar will also examine practical issues, including how to work with communities, how to coordinate cases that touch on multiple jurisdictions, how to interact with large teams of lawyers in different countries, and how to address unique cross-cultural and logistical challenges given the transnational nature of these cases.</p> <p>A limited number of seats in the seminar are reserved for clinical students enrolled in the Human Rights Entrepreneurs and Incubator Clinic, which gives students the opportunity to work in a lab-like atmosphere to support entrepreneurial litigators as they attempt to translate their ideas for change into reality.</p>"

This seminar explores this essential question experientially, intellectually, and personally. Students begin the seminar by taking an intensive multi-day workshop that trains them in the theory and practice of community organizing. In teams facilitated by experienced organizer-coaches, students learn the craft of public narrative, weaving together stories of self and of shared communal purpose to motivate collective agency; the meaning of public leadership within the context of organizing teams; the relationship between strategy and tactical action; and the connection between organizing campaigns and enduring structures of community power. The workshop is team-based and coaches students in linking their personal sources of inspiration and motivation to focused and purposive action that is in service of social justice and emancipation. </p> <p>The remainder of the semester focuses on lawyering and its relationship to organizing, movements, and social change. Can law be a useful tool in efforts to upend entrenched injustice, including systemic racism and economic oppression? How can lawyers share skills, knowledge and resources while supporting the collective agency and empowerment of nonlawyers working for bold emancipatory futures? What forms of relationships between lawyers and organizers in shared coalition spaces best facilitate such partnerships? And what do legal tactics that aim to support enduring community power, even above short-term campaign victories, look like in practice?</p> <p>Students can expect to engage closely with readings from various traditions, including from scholars of abolition, critical studies (CLS and CRT), and law and social movements. This seminar accompanies and is a co/pre-requisite for the Institute to End Mass Incarceration Clinic. Admission is by application.

The course will offer a comprehensive overview of appellate advocacy covering matters such as how to define the issues for appeal; the process of seeking discretionary review in an appellate court; how to draft persuasive briefs; and how to prepare for and deliver an effective oral argument. It will also introduce students to pathways to a career as an appellate advocate. The class will focus on the federal appellate system, with a particular emphasis on the Supreme Court, but the skills covered in the course can be applied in any appellate court. The writing and advocacy exercises will draw from actual cases involving cutting-edge legal issues - such as cases involving the First Amendment, the separation of powers, criminal procedure, or complex jurisdictional questions. This will allow class members to grapple with inherently interesting substantive questions on an array of topics as they develop their advocacy skills.</p> <p>The centerpiece of the class experience will be interactive writing and oral advocacy exercises. The course will employ a writer's workshop approach that builds advocacy skills through the sharing of work product and crowd-sourcing of feedback. Each class session will target a discrete aspect of appellate practice, broken down into its essential components. To make the learning experience concrete, we will provide an overview of the topic for the day (for example, the purpose of the \"questions presented\" section of a brief and the options for crafting those questions), and students will participate in guided writing or oral advocacy exercises designed to hone particular skills. Students will also participate in moot courts as both advocates and judges. The course is designed for students who are interested in developing their talents in appellate advocacy through participatory exercises in a collaborative, supportive environment. It is also ideal for students planning to serve as judicial law clerks</p> <p>In addition to focusing on written and oral appellate advocacy, the course will also offer guidance on other aspects of litigating an appeal, such as learning the rules of appellate procedure, working with the Solicitor General's Office, and working with potential amici. Some sessions may feature guest speakers with expertise in appellate advocacy who can offer insight drawn from experience. Appellate advocacy is an art form that can only be perfected through practice and observation of master practitioners.

Over the past 50-plus years, Congress has enacted a myriad of consumer protection statutes and in so doing conferred on various administrative agencies substantial discretionary, quasi-legislative authority to regulate how these products are marketed and delivered. In the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, Congress consolidated most of those authorities into a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with a broad mandate and even a wider degree of discretion than had previously existed.&nbsp;</p> <p>This course will introduce students to a set of real-world legal and policy questions that have arisen during the Bureau&rsquo;s first decade, including questions relating to the regulation of mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, payday loans and overdraft services.

Students must be able to participate in the full four days of training (or have previously completed HMP&rsquo;s basic mediation training program) to be eligible to mediate.</p> <p><strong>By Permission:</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Add/Drop Deadline:</strong> August 18, 2023.</p> <p><strong>LLM Students:</strong> LLM students may enroll in this clinic through Helios.</p> <p>This 1-credit seminar is the required classroom component for students doing work through the Mediation Clinic. Students will read and discuss works related to: the legal, procedural and practical context in which we mediate; frameworks for evaluating the quality and efficacy of our work as mediators; handling challenges to mediator neutrality, impartiality, and ethics; working with parties to prepare effective settlement agreements; and understanding the role of party-advocates in a mediation context. Some sessions will require students to present problems related to the clinical work in which they are currently engaged to the members of the class for discussion and brainstorming. Students will submit approximately four short written journal entries reflecting on their mediation experience/observations, a written mock mediation scenario, and a final 7-10 page paper in the form of an extended journal entry.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Rather than a one-hour session each week, it is anticipated that this seminar will meet for 2 hour sessions concentrated in the second half of the semester, after the required training has been completed.</p>"

Even before this emergency immersion into remote learning for primary and secondary schools, kids and teens were at the vanguard of the twenty-first century transformation toward living networked lives within networked institutions. Children's and adolescents' openness to and facility with new and emerging digital technologies creates a sense of community that transcends physical and other traditional institutional boundaries, as well as a sense of self that is highly individualized. For instance, a child in a remote rural American town could play Minecraft with like-minded peers the world over and become Internet famous for their YouTube videos of local cows dressed up as Minecraft denizens. They could also become inspired by social justice activism on Twitter and be the first person in town to put up a &ldquo;Black Lives Matter&rdquo; banner. The potential for new connections and new forms of self-expression both online and off are essentially endless&mdash;as are the accompanying questions about whether and how state and federal laws, regulations, and other institutional policies, norms, and values interact with youth data privacy and other components of youth digital citizenship. For instance, what happens to our hypothetical child if they are arrested for hanging their banner on government property without a permit, and local law enforcement wants to search their social media accounts? This reading group will look at youth digital privacy and digital citizenship more broadly in the context of three primary institutions: (1) learning ecosystems, with a focus on the recent mode of pandemic operation in K-12 public and private schools; (2) the justice system (including school disciplinary proceedings, interactions with law enforcement, and court proceedings); and (3) family units (including nuclear, extended, foster, group home, institutional, and homeless configurations). The group will identify, analyze, and challenge the laws, regulations, policies, practices, and norms that enable or constrain the development of youth data privacy and digital citizenship through diverse readings and dynamic discussion of these cutting-edge topics.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This reading group will meet on the following dates: 9/13, 9/27, 10/11, 10/25, 11/8, 11/29</p>"

Transitional justice refers to the judicial and non-judicial processes and mechanisms countries may use to seek to address mass or systemic war crimes and violations of human rights, including prosecutions, truth-seeking processes, reparations programs, and guarantees of non-recurrence, primarily institutional reforms. Practitioners and scholars largely agree that transitional justice is critical to achieving a durable peace and preventing future harms, however, there is no formula for transitional justice and the needs of each context are unique.</p> <p>This seminar will examine transitional justice through a lens of dispute system design, engaging questions such as: </p><ul> <li><strong>What </strong> is the legal foundation for transitional justice? <ul> <li><em>Where does transitional justice come from as a field? What legal parameters and rights exist?</em></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>When</strong> should a transitional justice system be established? <ul> <li><em>When is a context ripe for transitional justice? How can tensions between justice and peace be addressed?</em></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Who </strong>should design and implement the transitional justice processes? <ul> <li><em>Who should be the design decision-makers? Who should be consulted? Who should have ownership of the transitional justice system? </em></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>How </strong>should a transitional justice system be designed? <ul> <li><em>Which judicial and non-judicial processes and mechanisms should be used and how should each be designed? How do these processes and mechanisms intersect and interact with each other? What values should be promoted and what remedies should be provided?</em></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>When</strong>is transitional justice complete and <strong>how</strong> should the transitional justice system be evaluated? <ul> <li><em>How do implementers know when transitional justice has been concluded? What metrics can be used to evaluate the successes and shortcomings of a system?</em></li> </ul> </li> <p>All of the above are live and heavily debated questions in the field of transitional justice and will be examined in the seminar through a combination of readings, country-specific case studies, lectures, discussions, and a simulation on designing transitional justice. The seminar will also connect with one or more guest speakers who engaged in the design and implementation of transitional justice in their countries. </p>"

This course explores the varied roles that international lawyers and international institutions have played in shaping responses to climate change, the competing legal projects and strategies that they have developed to do so, and the shifting geopolitical contexts in which this work is taking place.</p> <p>Our focus will include the role of international lawyers in multilateral negotiations conducted under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the move by small island states to seek advisory opinions on climate change from the International Court of Justice and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the turn to human rights litigation as a means of demanding greater climate action from states and fossil fuel companies, the use of trade and investment agreements as a basis for private actors to challenge state regulatory responses to climate change, expanding the role of the UN Security Council to address climate-related risks to international peace and security, and the proposal of a new international crime of ecocide. We will explore how the relative strengths of states, corporations, investors, and civil society organizations in different international fora have influenced the direction of new treaties, litigation strategies, security agendas, and multilateral projects.</p> <p>The readings will include texts from law, history, political economy, and postcolonial theory, designed to interrogate how broader narratives of climate change are used to justify particular technical legal projects. Throughout, we will evaluate whether and how international lawyers are supporting or delaying the decarbonization of the global economy, and which actors are empowered by different forms of international legal engagement with climate change.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This course will meet over the first six weeks of the term.</p>"

The short introductory portion surveys the landscape of international courts and tribunals, including those constituted to resolve disputes between States, such as the International Court of Justice, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, and ad hoc inter-State arbitral tribunals; those that arbitrate disputes between foreign investors and States, such as tribunals formed by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes; and those that resolve private international commercial disputes, such as arbitrations conducted under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce.

Students will then devise strategies for planning the organizational structure of the brief, including through detailed outlining. In doing so, particular attention will be paid to developing logical flow of argumentation. Specific topics that will be addressed include techniques for achieving an effective integration of facts and law; applying the case law of international courts and tribunals to the dispute at issue; interpreting treaties through the relevant principles set out in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties; developing arguments concerning whether (or not) there are relevant rules of customary international law in light of State practice and opinio juris; and learning how to anticipate and preempt arguments that might be made by the opposing party. Students will also learn strategies for editing and refining the brief prior to its submission. </p> <p>The final part of the course focuses on oral advocacy.

Regular class participation will also count heavily toward the final course grade.</p> <p>This course explores differences in corporate governance and financing across listed companies both within and across jurisdictions. A principal point of comparison will be the structure of share ownership and the identity of large shareholders. For example, companies might be widely held by retail or institutional investors who play a passive role in corporate affairs except under unusual circumstances. Alternatively, a company might be controlled or influenced by large block shareholders. Family and founder control are common forms of blockholder control in most jurisdictions. But there are very different subtypes within this category. Even the venerable family dynasty comes in multiple flavors. Family members may inherit active leadership positions in their companies from the preceding generation or they may play the role of non-executive directors or monitoring shareholders who intervene only at critical moments. Similarly, founders may aspire to found family businesses or to secure leadership positions only for themselves as is usually the case when founders of American tech firms capitalize their companies with through multiclass IPOs. The principal example of the third major class of dominant shareholder is the State. And the motivations behind state ownership may be the most varied of all. They range from investment and security interests to advancing political or personal agendas with no immediate connection to a company&rsquo;s business. Our course materials match each of these ownership configurations with corresponding legal and capital constraints. Up to a point, financial markets, relational banking, and State-rationed capital each seem to align with ownership structure. But even as access to capital becomes more competitive, the legal, cultural, and political institutions that evolved with constrained access to capital may have an inertia of their own.</p> <p>Students who enrolled and completed the course, Comparative Corporate Law, Finance and Governance, are not eligible to enroll in this offering.</p>"

Yet public administration is, for some, at the core of constitutionalism, in so far as it governs the relationships between citizens and government across a wide range of areas. The constitutional role of executive departments and administrative agencies has become increasingly contentious, as discussed, for example, in Stephen Skowronek et al, Phantoms of a Beleaguered Republic (2021). This course will explore the relationships between constitutionalism and public administration, between constitutional law and administrative law, in the United States and in other constitutional democracies. Specific topics are likely to include the constitutional role and degree of independence of the civil service and of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fourth Branch\u00e2\u20ac institutions designed to protect integrity and competence; the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deep state\u00e2\u20ac as concept and critique; constitutional variations between and among parliamentary and presidential systems that affect the execution of laws; the constitutional roles of legislatures, after enacting laws, in supervising their administration; the role of courts in reviewing challenges to executive/administrative actions or omissions; the role of chief executives, heads of department or ministers in issuing regulations and administering the law; and constitutions as facilitating or obstructing effective and rights-respecting administration of public law.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This reading group will meet on the following dates: 9/11, 10/2, 10/10, 10/23, 11/6, 11/20</p>"

To date, however, our nation has mostly stumbled in its efforts to craft laws that meet the immense challenge of reducing domestic greenhouse gas emissions and that redress the massive adverse effects of climate change that can no longer be avoided during our own lifetimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Meeting those lawmaking challenges will require far more than the enactment of traditional pollution control laws that impose emissions limitations on the largest immediate domestic sources of greenhouse gases, such as motor vehicles, power plants, and other industrial activities that burn fossil fuels to produce energy. No less than a wholesale transformation of how we produce and distribute energy will be required. The necessary technology to accomplish that transformation already exists or is within reach. The principal obstacle is instead existing laws that fail to control emissions adequately, unwittingly promote the status quo, and erect insurmountable hurdles to securing the necessary reform of the nation&rsquo;s laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This course will examine the constructive role that lawyers can play in addressing climate change in several diverse legal practice areas beyond classic pollution control and natural resource management, including, for example, corporate law, energy regulation, financial regulation, intellectual property law, national security law, and international climate treaty negotiation. Their work, moreover, can be in a wide variety of practice settings, whether as federal, state, tribal, or local government lawyers; public interest advocates for national and local environmental organizations; or private sector lawyers &mdash; including those in large and small law firms serving as counsel to private companies seeking to sell products and services that promote such a transition.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This course meets over six weeks, starting on March 4, 2024.</p>"

By applying some relevant theories and approaches such as New Home Economics (initiated by Gary Becker and his critics) and bargaining under the shadow of the law on selected family law issues, such as marital contracts, divorce and post-divorce distributive regimes of marital property and alimony, this seminar will comparatively examine the particular default rules, legal regimes, choices and solutions developed by each legal system on these issues, and will explore their impact on the positions and strategies advanced by various legal actors. Throughout our comparative study of the various approaches of these legal systems towards the economic relationship of spouses during marriage and at divorce, we will examine any possible convergence and divergence between these legal systems, as well as the potential of different legal theories for universal and particular application. By exploring the legal history, default rules and case-law aspects of selected family law issues from these legal systems, our comparative analysis will help us to examine whether the particular rules and choices made by each legal system are justified and whether any alternatives can be imagined, especially under the light of some of the challenges and demands present in the current legal reform debates in these legal systems.

Fugitive Negotiation refuses that premise, instead seeking to understand negotiation with/in the law as intimately related to the backdrops of colonialism, chattel slavery, and their afterlives. Fugitive Negotiation is a Black queer feminist approach to negotiating power, space, and purpose rooted in surviving long histories of extraction, violence, and dispossession, while visioning and building new futures; a negotiation theory that looks as closely at the power we can, do, and might wield as the power we encounter. </p> <p>This course will invite you to examine how power shapes your negotiation and legal practice and to explore strategies beyond those traditionally offered in the law or marketed in its shadow. We will draw wisdom from Black queer feminist texts and ancestors, arts practices, and creative engagement to identify our negotiation principles and expand our negotiation repertoire.

We should tell clients the candid truth <em>and</em> deliver this message diplomatically. We have a duty to respect the law <em>and</em> a calling to evolve it. </p> <p>We all face situations where our choices feel diametrically opposed, yet neither option is sufficient on its own. For example, should I prioritize my own needs or the needs of others? As a leader, is it more important to focus on action or reflection? Should I press for change, or keep things stable? Is it better for society to value justice or mercy?</p> <p>This juxtaposition of opposites tricks us into thinking we must choose one <em>Or</em> the other \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and sometimes that is true. But the examples above are a special type of opposites, called Polarities. With Polarities, the opposites are interdependent, meaning that the path to success requires us to pursue <em>Both</em>. Some examples of Polarities are simple: Our bodies require <em>both</em> Rest <em>and</em> Activity. Our lungs must inhale <em>and</em> exhale. As for the more nuanced examples of polarities above: We should focus on our own needs <em>and</em> the needs of others; effective leaders take action <em>and</em> spend time in reflection; it is useful to promote change <em>and</em> maintain a stable core; and, to function properly, societies should honor the principles of justice <em>and</em> mercy.</p> <p>The instinct to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153choose\u00e2\u20ac isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t our fault.

The group will cast particular focus on questions about the proper role of the federal judiciary in interpreting and applying statutes. Should the federal courts strive to decode the most accurate reading of statutory texts, acting as Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s faithful agents in the work they do? Or should federal courts, as principals of a co-equal branch, take responsibility for making statutory programs work sensibly and effectively, acting as Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partners in the enterprise of governance? How, if at all, do our answers change when Congress has given federal agencies primary responsibility for carrying out the programmatic aims of federal statutes? Finally, what metric does one use answer the foregoing question? Do our answers come from the text and structure of the U.S. Constitution, from the accretion of constitutional practice, from a political theory of how best to make a constitutional democracy serve the broad goals of public welfare, or from some other source?

In particular, low-income students, students of color, students with disabilities, and English language learners continue to evidence lower levels of educational attainment across a range of indicators compared with their more affluent and White peers. Many state and district education systems fail to provide adequate and/or equitable access to educational opportunities that effectively prepare students to compete in the world of work and/or to understand, appreciate, and participate meaningfully in democratic institutions. The post-COVID workforce shortage and crisis in student mental health; the rapid proliferation of technological innovations, including the advent of AI; and the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing civic divisiveness together constitute an unprecedented set of challenges that complicate the question of how to envision and operationalize a 21st century education system that works for all learners. This seminar will explore and evaluate the potential role of state constitutional litigation as a strategy for pursuing public education reform that begins to address these manifold difficulties by fully (re)defining and enforcing all students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 right to a meaningful educational opportunity.</p> <p>More specifically, the seminar will examine a number of state supreme court cases that have interpreted the education clauses in their respective constitutions to require that their states provide all children an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adequate\u00e2\u20ac or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sound basic\u00e2\u20ac education. Although these rulings have explored and articulated many educational concepts that constitute components of a meaningful educational opportunity, none have comprehensively specified the full range of resource inputs or educational outcomes that should constitute a baseline education in a democratic society. We will closely examine the written decisions in these cases to determine the extent to which their holdings contain helpful building blocks for articulating a contemporary constitutional theory of the right to a meaningful educational opportunity (as well as ways in which they are inadequate for addressing current and future challenges). We will also analyze portions of the evidentiary record in some of these litigations to gain insight on the types of evidence regarding student needs that courts have found persuasive. Orders and pleadings from the remedial stages of these cases will also provide valuable insights on how an updated and comprehensive right to a meaningful educational opportunity might actually be implemented. Through our close analysis of a limited number of cases, the seminar will provide students with the rare opportunity to get a good sense of how a constitutional litigation is conducted from pleadings through the trial and remedy stages.</p> <p>Our analysis will necessarily take account of recent developments in federal law, particularly the Supreme Court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision in the Harvard/UNC cases, which arguably constrains states\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 race conscious efforts to address educational inequities. We will look at federal cases dealing with gender equity, as well as the rights of English learners and students with disabilities, to consider whether they offer any alternative options for conceptualizing comprehensive approaches to educational equity.</p> <p>Students will produce a research memo for the seminar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final assignment and class participation will constitute a portion of the grade; there will be no final exam. Students enrolled in the Education Law Clinic: Strategic Litigation will be required to enroll in this seminar as a co-requisite for the clinic.</P>"

Often described as an essential separation-of-powers constraint on the executive branch, this power has been at the center of many recent controversies, including the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the 2008 financial crisis, payment of Obamacare subsidies, President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s border wall funding, President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first impeachment, and President Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s student debt relief plan. The reading group will examine scholarly writings on this topic along with court decisions and other primary materials relating to recent controversies. Questions for discussion will include: How does Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power of the purse relate to the constitutional powers of the executive and judicial branches? What makes the power of the purse effective? Is it losing effectiveness? Should political polarization affect how we think about the power of the purse?

The idea of rights of nature (RoN) may seem farfetched, but it is already a reality in many jurisdictions around the world, including in the U.S. The growing prominence of RoN can be seen as a response to our ongoing destruction of nature, combining liberal rights with assertions by indigenous peoples of their right to live in harmony with nature. The leading RoN example is Ecuador, where the constitution (2008) specifically provides for RoN in Article 71: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nature, or Pacha Mama, where life is reproduced and occurs, has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes.\u00e2\u20ac In a series of decisions, the Constitutional Court of Ecuador has elaborated on Article 71, granting rights to a river, a forest, and, most recently, a wooly monkey named Estrellita.

The catalyst for the act was the agreement by the US and Britain to create a military base on one of the islands, Diego Garcia. Mauritius attained its independence in 1968, without the Chagos Archipelago. Between 1968 and 1973 the entire population of Chagos was forcibly deported to Mauritius, Seychelles and the UK. In 1982, Mauritius began to agitate for the return of the Chagos Archipelago, which culminated in February 2019 with an Advisory Opinion by the International Court of Justice that the separation of the Chagos Archipelago was unlawful and without legal effect, that Chagos remained a part of Mauritius, and the Chagossians were entitled to return. </p> <p>The course will address these events through two lenses: <br><em>First, by reference to practise under international law, through five illustrative moments and cases before the IMT and ICJ (Nuremberg, 1945; South West Africa, 1966; Nicaragua, 1984; Whaling in the Antarctic, 2012; Decolonisation of Chagos, 2019); Second, by reference to the experience of a single individual, Liseby Elyse, born in 1953 on Peros Banhos, an island of the Chagos Archipelago, descended from enslaved people, in 1973 forcibly deported to Mauritius by the UK (with US support), in 2018 the key witness in proceedings before the ICJ on the right to return. </em></br></p> <p>The course will explore the interrelationship between the life of an individual, on the one hand, and the changing role and practise of international law and the ICJ, on the other. It addresses also the changing relationship between the US and the UK and the idea of an international rule of law - the rights of individuals and groups under international law, the role of international courts, decolonisation and self-determination \u00e2\u20ac\u201c over a period of seventy-five years. The course will also touch on the implications for the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine. </p> <p>The key themes include:</p><p> <ul> <li>the reality of international law and litigation, as opposed to its presentation in academic discourse; </li> <li>the role of individuals in the making and application of international laws;</li> <li>matters of gender, identity and race in international legal discourse;</li> <li>international legal discourses in the forms of narrative and story-telling; and</li> <li>making aspects of international law more accessible to others outside the discipline. </li> </ul></p> <p>The course will be based on Philippe Sands's new book, <em>The Last Colony</em>, published in the U.S. by Alfred Knopf in September 2023. </p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This reading group will meet from March 19 through April 9, with two makeup sessions needing to be scheduled. </p>"

If have taken another negotiation course at Harvard, you will find that this course builds upon and extends what you learned.</p> <p><strong>Exam Type:</strong> No Exam</p> <p>Leaders and change agents of all kinds often must engage effectively with people whose worldviews are very different than their own. Conflicts involving deeply held values and other fundamental differences in perspective present special challenges and may require adjustments to approaches to negotiation we use in other situations. Through interdisciplinary readings, presentations, negotiation simulations, dialogue experiences, exercises, discussion, and reflective practices, this practice-focused, workshop style course aims to help participants become more aware of how their own and others\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worldviews influence conflicts involving identity-defining value differences and to help them become more effective negotiators. </p> <p>Worldview conflict can arise in what we think of as private (e.g., business transactions), local (e.g., land use disputes), societal (e.g., the abortion debate), or global (e.g., climate change policy) contexts. We will consider the potential and challenges of negotiation across diverse contexts, taking up topics such as the comparative advantages and disadvantages, and interplay among, litigation, civil resistance, and negotiation as tools for social change and a bounded theory of pluralistic relativism as a response to the reality of moral diversity.</p> <p>This course is intensive and time consuming. Because any absences deprive your peers of the chance to participate and learn from collaborative experiences, attendance for all class sessions is mandatory.</p> <p>The course is limited to 48 students. In addition to participating in in-class activities, students will be expected to keep a journal and submit potions of it throughout the term and will participate in a small group dialogue that requires a modest commitment of time outside class.

Through a series of simulated business transactions informed by real world corporate experiences, students will have the opportunity to practice their negotiation skills and develop their own personal negotiation style. Students will engage in: (1) negotiation preparation and planning, (2) matter/case evaluation, (3) client counseling and securing of informed client consent, (4) analysis of bargaining range and principled concession patterns, (5) problem-solving strategies, (6) information bargaining, and (7) dispute resolution. Students will consider ethical requirements and norms in negotiations. Students also will complete various written assignments, including reflection journals, negotiation plans and deal documentation. Students will learn to internalize habits of preparation, analysis, prediction, flexibility, and self-evaluation, which will support continuous improvement of their negotiation skills.</p>"

Dozens of countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe have established truth commissions to help them deal with their violent pasts and chart better, more peaceful and more democratic futures. They adopt these transitional justice mechanisms because their regular justice systems are inadequate to deal with the scale of human rights violations committed, provide reasonable redress to victims, or promote reconciliation and healing.</p> <p>Truth commission mandates are usually limited to relatively short periods of time ranging from a few months to a few years, and are restricted to specific episodes or events in the recent past. They generally have as their key objectives to discover the truth of what happened, identify the key perpetrators, facilitate justice for victims (including reparations), promote reconciliation and healing, and recommend institutional reforms and the prosecution of those found most responsible for human rights violations.

Students use the legal tools contained in the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and related laws (including the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1972, federal Medicaid laws, and federal and state statutes regarding confidentiality, among others) to advocate for individual remedies that will enable their client's children to succeed in school. Students will utilize research from psychology, neurobiology, and education about the effects of trauma on learning to inform their representation. Depending on the posture of the cases in the clinic, students will represent clients either at the first administrative hearing level - the IEP team meeting - or at the administrative appeal level - the Bureau of Special Education Appeals. Past students have made enormous differences in the lives of children by obtaining an appropriate education, and in many cases reversing school exclusions, for individual children at school. Though the major focus of students' clinic work will be direct client representation, students will also engage in systemic advocacy that furthers the Clinic&rsquo;s broader mission. In recent semesters, this has included conducting legal trainings for expert evaluators and community-based mental health providers so they can assist their families to navigate the special education system at school and assert their legal rights. The Education Law Clinic is part of the Trauma and Learning Policy Initiative (TLPI), the mission of which is to ensure that all children, including those traumatized by exposure to violence and other adverse childhood experiences, succeed in school. The clinic's direct legal representation of individual families is a key strategy in TLPI's ongoing multi-strategic advocacy campaign to create safe and supportive school environments where all students can learn and thrive.</p>"

The Bureau specializes in four major areas of practice: housing law, including evictions and housing discrimination; family law, including divorce, child custody, paternity, visitation, support, and Special Immigrant Juvenile Status issues; fair wage law, including nonpayment or underpayment of wages; and government benefits law, including appeals of the denial or termination of unemployment or social security disability benefits. Because the Bureau is student-run, students take the lead in setting organizational policy and exploring potential new areas or modes of practice. Enrollment is by application during the spring of the student's 1L year; participants commit to at least 20 hours per week of clinic work for the following two academic years.</p>"

The Clinic serves as&nbsp;partner and legal advisor&nbsp;to a wide range of human rights and civil rights organizations in the United States and globally. Working on small project teams under the close supervision of expert clinicians, students take the lead on lawyering and advocating for human rights across a range of thematic and geographic areas, using a variety of skills that reflect the diverse modes of human rights practice. Students are involved in all aspects of their projects, from conceptualizing goals and formulating strategies, to researching and drafting reports, treaties, and legal briefs, to interviewing witnesses, to presenting findings before courts and international bodies. Students will be exposed to multiple strategies and innovative techniques for promoting and protecting human rights, and will also critically reflect on their work and the human rights movement more broadly.</p> <p>IHRC&rsquo;s docket draws on clinicians&rsquo; established expertise and networks in six broad areas, while remaining dynamic and responsive to emerging needs and the evolving field. Our primary areas of work are: (1) accountability and remedies; (2) armed conflict &amp; civilian protection; (3) climate justice &amp; the environment; (4) gender, race &amp; non-discrimination; (5) protecting fundamental freedoms; and (6) social &amp; economic justice.</p> <p>Spring clinic students must take an accompanying clinical seminar (2 classroom credits). The seminars teach the skills and methods of human rights practitioners through case studies, workshopping of clinical projects, and simulations related to fact-finding and field investigations, media work, and/or negotiation and legislative work. Clinical seminar selection and enrollment occurs once a student has enrolled in the clinic and is orchestrated by the Office of Clinical and Pro Bono Programs.</p>"
