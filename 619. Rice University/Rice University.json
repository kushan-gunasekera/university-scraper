Is a Black aesthetic inherently revolutionary and interested in the political lives of black people and their liberation? Or is a Black aesthetic best exemplified by the manipulation of materials, visual composition, and saturation? Or both? We will engage theories of black art and aesthetics that emerged in the 1920s through today to take seriously the question: how does the visual life of blackness matter? In this class we will break through the traditional rhetoric of diversity and representation and discuss how artists over the decades have insisted instead on redistributions of power, radical and speculative material practices, and structural change. It is my priority to make this course on black aesthetics joyous, safe, and accessible to students of all genders, sexualities, and disabilities. Cross-list: HART 204."

At the same time, we develop a cross-cultural perspective by comparing our own notions of what counts as bad language with ways of speaking that others cultural groups consider rude, vulgar, and even dangerous. We will also explore how different societies set standards for pronunciation, word choice, spelling, speaking and writing, how those standards are enforced, and how/why they sometimes get contested or resisted. Under this heading we consider such issues as plagiarism, libel, hate speech, intellectual property and, in general, the policing of language and signs."

Students will learn methodologies and gain practical experience in the fields of ecology, paleontology, and paleoanthropology. Activities will include observing wildlife in natural ecosystems including the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Serengeti National Park and participating in paleontological excavations at Olduvai Gorge\u2014 all UNESCO World Heritage Sites in northern Tanzania. By examining both the dynamics of the modern African savanna ecosystem and the paleoecology of the region, this course provides both a way of understanding our origins as well as a glimpse into our possible future in a rapidly changing world.

The general consensus is that human rights are important because they protect us against abuse and harm, but what might it mean to consider that human rights are not always good? How might we have to reconceptualize the use, utility, and possibility of human rights when they are used to reinforce inequality, persecute vulnerable populations, or support nativist rhetoric and policy?

Does development in multimedia technologies help or undermine our\ncapacities to elicit the \"truth\" and \"reality\"? In this seminar, we will explore the field of visual anthropology to consider how different media practices shape and inform our pursuit of knowledge about human conditions. Lectures, readings, and discussions will furnish students with key concepts for analyzing and articulating media practices through the lens of authorship, audience, circulation, and archival practices. Throughout the course, students will engage with and develop approaches to challenging subjects of representation, such as sensorial experiences, taboos, memories of violence and trauma, and politically charged cross-cultural dialogues. Graduate/Undergraduate Equivalency: ANTH 328. Recommended Prerequisite(s): Although there are no required prerequisites to this course, students are recommended to have some background in anthropology, cinema and media studies, history, or other related fields in social sciences. Class readings and mini lectures will provide some historical backgrounds and key approaches in anthropology.

This course will look at the cultural dimensions of systems of exchange, ranging from gift giving among Northwest Coast Indians to foreign currency exchanges between financial institutions. Along with the classic work of Marx and Simmel on money and capital, we will also cover some of the anthropological work on gifts and exchange, such as that of Mauss, Levi-Strauss, and Bourdieu, as well as some of the contemporary debates initiated by Bataille and Derrida.

While our scope is both geographically and temporally broad, specific case studies will be highlighted from Africa, Eurasia, North America, and the Pacific islands. The unifying thread among these case studies is a focus on lines of evidence, with the goal of exposing students to the diverse methods of archaeology: how can archaeologists determine the impacts of humans upon animals and vice versa, and how well are their interpretations supported by their data? Finally, we consider how knowledge of the past can help shape our approaches to animals and their environments today, with respect for the planet that we all share.

In the first half of this seminar, we will explore the history of social design and how anthropological culture theory and its insights into the interpretation of meaning (e.g., Geertz) have directly impacted practices of social design. We will also explore how design\u2019s concern with innovation and futurity has attracted interest from public anthropologists interested not only in analyzing the world as it stands but also changing it for the better. In the second half of the course, the seminar will incorporate studio exercises where students will work in teams to practice social design skills through public-engaged projects to identify problems that are susceptible to social design solutions. Graduate/Undergraduate Equivalency: ANTH 368. Recommended Prerequisite(s): There are no specific prerequisites for this course.

The general consensus is that human rights are important because they protect us against abuse and harm, but what might it mean to consider that human rights are not always good? How might we have to reconceptualize the use, utility, and possibility of human rights when they are used to reinforce inequality, persecute vulnerable populations, or support nativist rhetoric and policy?

        "course_description": "This course offers an introduction to design anthropology in theory and practice. Design anthropology is a fast-developing interdisciplinary field that incorporates concepts, research methods and creative practices drawn from design and anthropology. Design anthropology draws upon anthropological insights into social relations and cultural forms in order to challenge expert-defined design practices with more collaborative and contextually sensitive processes of design co-creation. In the first half of this seminar, we will explore the history of social design and how anthropological culture theory and its insights into the interpretation of meaning (e.g., Geertz) have directly impacted practices of social design. We will also explore how design\u2019s concern with innovation and futurity has attracted interest from public anthropologists interested not only in analyzing the world as it stands but also changing it for the better. In the second half of the course, the seminar will incorporate studio exercises where students will work in teams to practice social design skills through public-engaged projects to identify problems that are susceptible to social design solutions. Graduate/Undergraduate Equivalency: ANTH 461. Recommended Prerequisite(s): There are no specific prerequisites for this course. However, introductory level familiarity with anthropological theory and practice will be helpful. Design skills will also be useful, although are not required since the seminar\u2019s focus will be on design ideation.

We will do deep dives of several important pandemic diseases to understand their epidemiological contexts, pathogenesis and disease states. We will then examine how vaccines, antiviral and antimicrobial strategies work to protect human health at the molecular level. Importantly, we will then examine how molecular evolution provides adaptation to various biomedical interventions and why the fight against infectious diseases cannot be easily won.

While Business 540 focuses on seminal theory and recent theoretical approaches in the strategic management literature, this seminar focuses on phenomena and research topics in strategy research. It provides an overview of classic and current research topics including innovation and technology strategy, strategic alliances and networks, international strategy, product diversification, corporate governance, executive leadership, strategic decision processes, change and adaptation. Specific topics and phenomena will be examined from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. From the theoretical perspective, we will discuss how the various theories discussed in Business 540 are used to explain these phenomena. From the empirical perspective, we will discuss various research designs and methods used to in research on these topics. Overall, the intent of this seminar is to provide students a foundation for conducting and publishing original research in strategic management.  Repeatable for Credit."

Decisions about how to develop and choose risk management strategies are often based on pure vibes, but occasionally rigorous quantitative analyses that make use of scientific information can inform them (we will focus on these cases). These analyses involve integrating knowledge from multiple disciplines to balance competing goals (objectives) under uncertainty. In this course, you will learn a structured bottom-up decision analytic framework for quantitative climate risk analysis. This involves (i) defining a system of interest and what constitutes desirable outcomes; (ii) understanding and modeling the specific pathways through which climate variability and change can create risk to this system; (iii) identifying possible levers for risk management; (iv) quantifying the performance of proposed decisions under climate and other interacting factors; and (v) generating possible alternatives. You will be assigned readings for every class that cover relevant methods or applications, and will work collaboratively to implement key concepts through programming problem sets.

How can food or drink shape a second-generation community? In this course, we will be discussing boba tea primarily from the Asian-American and American experiences. We will learn about the traditional influences available at the inception of boba tea, explore how and why boba continues to evolve in the present day, and investigate the history of boba culture from the perspectives of both those in the Asian-American community and those outside of it. Regardless of the student\u2019s initial familiarity with boba, students will gain the cultural understanding to feel comfortable ordering and socializing in a boba shop. Students will demonstrate what they have learned in class and in readings/videos through online discussions. Learning will be augmented by hands-on boba-making activities and trips to local boba shops that are accompanied by individual reflections.

Specifically, we consider, What do the monotheistic faiths and modern science say about origins of life, and how harmonious or conflicting are their visions? We study both the original historical context and modern-day interpretations of the religious texts, as well as the history of evolution as an alternative origins framework.

The name itself brings both appeal and aversions, yet what really shines about the star is her songwriting. Through close readings of her music, alongside considerations of her public discourse, this class will be a seminar discussing the nuances of her lyrics. Using a chronological approach, this course will spend time on each one of her ten albums. We'll consider a broad range of topics, including: femininity and gender; social media and public opinion; politics and social impact; fiction and nonfiction; American nationalism and whiteness; and finally, family and feuds. \nWe therefore aim to answer the question: What does Taylor Swift\u2019s songwriting evolution say about her own personal growth surrounding public discourse? Instruction will be provided in lecture, discussion, and audiovisual formats. Knowledge will be evaluated with short written responses, participation in class discussions, and a final essay analyzing a song of your choosing.\""

        "course_description": "Role-playing video games, frequently shortened to role-playing games (RPGs), are a genre of video games, where the player interacts directly with the world, usually gaining character development in terms of recording statistics. The game world is often rooted in speculative fiction, drawing from fantasy and sci-fiction to inhabit worlds that suspend standard understandings of reality. More than other genres, RPGs rely on a combination of gameplay mechanics, cutscenes, and user interface to develop well-defined stories and settings that drive the complex negotiation between the player and the game. Building on this, how do RPGs integrate interactive gameplay and narrative elements to create an effective story?\nIn this course, we will explore elements of role-playing games (abilities, items, combat, cutscenes, setting) through the lenses of narrative (character development, worldbuilding, plot) with an intersectional framework that attends to culture, gender, sexuality, and disability simultaneously. We will be thinking about how RPGs serve as a site of speculative possibility for experimental and unconventional stories. During class, we will discuss popular RPGs such as Chrono Trigger and Legend of Zelda, as well as less known titles like Okami and Ib, walking through gameplay footage and cutscenes to eventually apply their understanding in a final project, where students get the opportunity to work in teams to either submit their own game design proposal or write a short analytical paper on a RPG of their choice."

As a result, it is more important than ever to ensure that programs function correctly and cannot be exploited by hostile adversaries. The field of formal methods takes on this challenge, developing algorithms and programming methodologies that can be used to formally reason about what happens when software executes on arbitrary inputs, often without actually executing the program. Such reasoning can be used, for example, to identify subtle bugs and vulnerabilities in programs, or to give mathematical proofs of program correctness. This is a hands-on introduction to the field of formal methods. In this class, you will learn the theoretical foundations of these systems; you will also implement a series of systems that can be used to reason about the correctness of C programs.

While we are not fully ready to welcome them, yet, we are more than certain that we need to work with them in ways that we did not know before. On the one hand, we are still challenged by many technical problems to enable robots to be more dexterous and robust. On another hand, in a time where resources are connected and networked, we need to design novel systems to manage different robots, share the robots, or even make them autonomously and adaptively build teams. In this senior design course, we will develop team-based projects and will look into a robotized future with our imaginations: we will either solve problems that are technically going to enhance the robot skills, or address problems that will make future robots more useful and more organized in the real world.  Background in robotics is not required. In our creative projects, your efforts in developing core robot algorithms, databases, machine learning systems, web applications, mobile apps, LLM models, or anything else that can be useful, will together make this robotized world a better place."

While this layered architecture has made building systems easier, it has also made understanding their behavior and performance more difficult. Every layer from the managed run-time environments used by modern programming languages to the hypervisor play a role in processor scheduling, memory management, and I/O, making it oftentimes difficult to pinpoint which layer of the system is interacting poorly with a program.  This class will teach students about the fundamental characteristics of the abstractions for processing, memory, and I/O at each layer of a modern computer system, so that they might understand the functionality provided by each layer, and instruct them on the use of modern debugging, profiling, and tracing tools, so that they are equipped to characterize the behavior and performance of their programs.

The Machine Learning component will, in part, build on the first two fundamental components and will be taught using the full class time.\nComputational Geophysics\nThe participants in this geophysics part of the course are expected to be interested into learn how to use modern seismic data to image the subsurface with awareness of the computational costs of the techniques involved. The main focus will be given to current seismic imaging tools including cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) applications. As the result of the successful completion of this course part, the course participants should be able to: (1) Understand the context and value of imaging tools for the hydrocarbon exploration business. (2) Relate the imaging tools with their computational costs for modern computer resources. (3) Properly use wave-based geophysical imaging and ML-based tools and (4) Understand main seismic processing and interpretation decisions.\nApplied Reservoir Simulation\nThis component of the course will introduce participants to the practice of reservoir simulation. This class will be an applied course on reservoir simulation. Theoretical descriptions will be provided as warranted but will be kept to minimum. Class participants will learn about the fundamentals of applied reservoir simulation, use of a reservoir simulator, and how to select the proper model for a simulation study. This course will also cover data preparation, grid design, calibration of the reservoir model, forecasting of future performance, and interpretation of simulation results. Participants will also be introduced to the role of simulation in reservoir management, limitations of reservoir simulation, and the structural aspects of the models. Upscaling and recent advances simulation techniques will also be discussed. A realistic open-source reservoir simulation software will be used during the tutorials and computer projects.\nMachine Learning for Oil & Gas\nThis part of the course will introduce the fundamentals of statistical learning, present a few of the popular learning paradigms and algorithms, and culminate in a small student project applying them to an oil reservoir data set using the R programming language (solutions to class problems will be accepted in any programming language or system). Much of the material presented here is also known under the names \u201cBig Data\u201d, \u201cData Analytics\u201d, \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d, \u201cData Mining\u201d, \u201cPetroleum Data Driven Analytics\u201d and other terms.

These theories use concepts from dynamical systems (attractors, oscillations, chaos) and concepts from statistics (information, uncertainty, inference) to relate the dynamics and functions of neural networks. We will apply these theories to sensory computation, learning and memory, and motor control. Students will learn to formalize and mathematically answer questions about neural computations, including \u201cwhat does a network compute?\u201d, \u201chow does it compute?\u201d, and \u201cwhy does it compute that way?\u201d\nPrerequisites: knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and probability and statistics.

Several classes throughout the semester will feature discussions with visiting publishers, editors, agents, poets, essayists, and/or novelists. Students will also be asked to become practitioners of \u201cliterary citizenship.\u201d This will come about through weekly attendance at staff meetings of The Rice Review, participation in literary events throughout Houston, and through the hands-on experience of planning and hosting The Rice Review\u2019s annual Fall Open Mic Night. All students will be considered as official staffers for the magazine and will be acknowledged in that year\u2019s annual issue. Course counts toward the English Creative Writing Major Concentration (ECRW). There is no prerequisite for this course, but a joy for reading and debating the qualities of great poetry and prose is strongly encouraged. ENGL 113 is a prerequisite for ENGL 114.

Focusing on works from Octavia Butler to Victor Levalle, from George Schuyler to Mat Johnson, from John Williams to Colson Whitehead among others, the course engages the ways in which these authors represent the monstrous and grotesque; pandemics, environmental and technological degradation and catastrophe; urbanization, gentrification, and immigration; and (biological/technological) warfare, in order to recalibrate our understanding of the central role race plays in determining both access to, and allocation of, necessary resources.  We will track the histories and afterlives of slavery and colonialism that continue to transfigure our society, while also studying varied blueprints for, and critiques of, alternative, more egalitarian societies imagined by these artists."

There were, however, poems of quite different kinds before and after Goethe, Eichendorff, and Heine. Without neglecting the Classical-Romantic period, the course will explore the history of lyric expression in German literature from the early modern period to the present in both poems and theoretical texts.

From diagrams in medical manuscripts to sculptures adorning cathedral fa\u00e7ades to body-part-shaped liturgical vessels, bodies are everywhere in medieval visual culture. We will pair these images and objects with medieval texts offering period insights into the nature and meanings of bodies, and consider them through a contemporary theoretical lens.

From burying ships beneath the ground to gilding the bones of deceased saints, medieval people went to great lengths to memorialize the dead. Represented in manuscripts, wall-painting, sculpture, and more, death pervaded the visual landscape of the Middle Ages. With threats of illness, war, invasion, and violence looming large throughout Europe in the period between 500 and 1500 CE, beliefs, superstitions, and fears around death governed medieval life. This course explores how those beliefs and fears became the basis of a rich, at times luxurious visual culture. From lavish textiles that adorned the recently deceased to elegant marble plaques affixed to tombs, the dead were often recipients of precious works of art. We will consider objects such as these, as well as representations of death itself. This is a discussion-based seminar in which we will investigate medieval attitudes around death, burial, and memorialization; students will conduct their own research on objects related to death in the Middle Ages. Students will develop the conceptual tools to analyze visual and material culture in historical context and through the lens of death."

We will take field trips into the studio spaces of Houston-based artists in order to ask questions about who they cite and why. Additionally, we will discuss how those citations of radical Black thought are visible within their art-making. Over the course of the semester, we will pair black contemporary artists with core readings in black studies and underline citational practices between the fields of Black studies and art history. Through this unique case-study-based pairing, students will learn about the methods, materials, and theoretical throughlines within the work of formative visual and performance artists while also becoming familiar with different concepts within the interdisciplinary field of black studies."

This class will examine the modernist fascination with monstrosity, asking why it became a topic of such interest to artists, writers, and filmmakers during this time, and what it can tell us about modernist aesthetics more broadly. Examining a range of representations from the 18th century on, we will look at visual artists, filmmakers, and novelists who depict various forms of monsters, be they human (Jack the Ripper) or non-human (the Golem). From Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein and the myth of the vampire, to Picasso\u2019s monstrous images of 1920s, to the distinctly modern phenomenon of serial killing, this course will chart the dark monstrous underside to modern art.

As industrial centers in East Asia continue to intensify, so does a swelling sentiment to capture and maintain national and cultural legacies. What do histories of science and technology in East Asia look like?  What should they represent? To answer these questions, this course uses histories of scientific and technological artifacts to explore the boundaries between forms of knowledge and expertise that are both common and uncommon. Each week, we will pair an artifact or process with core literature from Science and Technology and Society (STS) studies to read again the grain and raise new historical questions. Rather than a comprehensive survey of scientific ideas alone, this course takes on histories of everyday objects and their practices to expand the scope of STS at large."

In the small rooms of houses and on small screens of reality television programming. Whether streaming or tweeting, drama is everywhere. What is drama such that it enjoys such intensity and ubiquity? Is it an overflow of energy that creates authenticity? An artificially heightened state (as in \u201ctoo much drama\u201d)? A carefully crafted manipulation (as in \u201cpolitical drama\u201d)? A way of being in space? A cultural habit? This course considers why theater is so central to our idioms and cultural practices even for people who have never seen, much less set foot on, a proscenium stage. We\u2019ll explore the many senses of drama central to social behavior by witnessing the long transit of theater from the classical amphitheater to just about anywhere. The course is designed to offer an introduction to the history and conventions of theatrical practice, from the ancient theater to 21st-century immersive and site-specific performance, which will offer a lens for understanding the drama of human interaction that spills out everywhere. Class sessions will include: 1) lecture/discussions about the histories of theater and languages of performance; 2) Learning Lab sessions that allow students to create their own personal theatrical experience with a combination of acting and directing exercises, live performance experiences, and conversations with theater professionals; and 3) theater of the everyday exercises inviting students to look at the world from the point of view of theatrical experience. No previous theater experience or training required."

We will examine the unsettling question of \u201chatred\u201d through scholarly works, literary expressions, and visual culture dealing with prejudice, discrimination, extreme nationalistic movements, racism, and genocide. Along with these academic and artistic explorations, we will advance into the realm of engaged humanities and activism, through a series of presentations by scholars and advocates. The class will benefit from presentations by faculty and guest speakers from our university (the Boniuk Institute for Religious Tolerance, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion), and the larger Houston community (Houston Coalition Against Hate, Anti-Defamation League, ACLU, etc.)."

Thus, the philosophical material will be supplemented with poetry, film, literature, and personal essays from non-philosophers: material that will enrich their own thoughts as they try to determine the respect in which they agree or disagree with the philosophical perspectives on offer. One goal is to have the students recognize the extent to which philosophical reflection, and engaging with the humanities, can influence and deepen their perception and understanding of their lives."

Thomas More\u2019s original coinage, suggesting both \u201cgood place\u201d and \u201cno place,\u201d might give little cause for hope, but that hasn\u2019t stopped visionaries, scientists, artists and scholars from seeking it out over the years. It might be in our past, or just ahead. We might  be there now, if only we knew how to look: under the pavement, we might find the beach. Or utopia might be off our planet entirely.  Ideals shape societies; scientific research, architecture, city planning and cultural production all attest to the hopes and values that spawned them.  But as we consider the fallout of past utopian efforts, corollary questions present themselves: do we even want to find utopia?  Does every \u201cperfect\u201d society imply a dystopian counterpart?  Who is utopia for, and who is excluded?  This course will explore utopia through the work of scientists, architects, artists and art movements. Classes will fall into three categories: lectures and reading discussions; field trips; and group art projects. These latter Learning Lab projects will encourage students to work together and apply the readings, discussions and artistic precedents towards their own visions of utopia."

What makes Jewish culture radical? What are some of the aesthetic characteristics of alternative Jewish artistic practices? What social questions related to Jewish life are entangled within these practices? In what ways does alternative Jewish art expand the conversation on relevant social questions and vice versa?\n \nThis course explores this core set of questions among a range of Radical Jewish Cultures across media and around the world throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Moving through Europe, the U.S., Latin America, North Africa, and Israel/Palestine, we will read, listen to, and view Jewish literature, music, theatre, dance, and film that sit outside the mainstream."

Bhangra, rai, jazz, klezmer, and many more point to longer histories and larger systems of transnational movement and social consciousness. In this course, we follow the music to explore the central place of diaspora in our world as well as the social critiques it offers. We ask two simultaneous questions: How does diaspora shape music? And what can music teach us about diaspora? Throughout the semester, we will listen to and read about Afro-diasporic music, music from the Jewish diaspora, the South Asian diaspora, \u201cqueer diaspora,\u201d and beyond. Threaded together with broader materials from ethnomusicology, anthropology, cultural studies, and more, we explore key histories of border crossing that lead to modern diasporic formations, including the transatlantic African slave trade and colonialism. Critically analyzing musical questions such as tradition and hybridity leads us to examine diasporic approaches to themes of movement, borders, home, and identity, that challenge social systems of power. This course is designed to benefit and interest students from a wide range of disciplines and interests in the subject matter.

Students will think historically about the construction of race, ethnicity, and religion and the various modes by which these are employed, and they will use that knowledge to think critically about current depictions of anti-Semitic and Islamophobic violence. In the first part of the course, we will consider some of the historical and conceptual underpinnings of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. We will begin in medieval Spain and then track their development through modernity, paying close attention to how these discourses changed and evolved over time; in the second part, we will look at the impact of the Holocaust and the rise of the State of Israel and consider current iterations of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism in Europe and America today.

We will look at research across all levels of language (e.g., from sounds to clauses to interaction), and we will think about the positionality of the researcher as we develop our own methods and experiments.  Repeatable for Credit."

To get out of bed, lift objects, or clean our room, we need healthy range of motion around our joints. Over time, our inefficient habits of movement, and the decreased suppleness of muscle tissue that occurs naturally as we age can lead to reduced mobility of joints and compromised body positions. Staying active and stretching regularly reduces the chance of experiencing occasional and chronic musculoskeletal pain and helps prevent this loss of mobility. No previous experience is required and all fitness levels are welcome."

This course proposes to document the role of literature, painting, popular music, and, especially, cinema have played in memorializing our shared dread over not just the human body\u2019s failures, but also their treatment. While primarily focused on the American twentieth century, this course will begin in Romantic-era Britain with Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein, and will culminate in the very-recent past with Jordan Peele\u2019s Get Out. Along the way, we will attend to the 70s slasher film, the work of body horror\u2019s cinematic dean, David Cronenberg, Japanese cyberpunk, extreme metal and grindcore lyrics, the paintings of Lucien Freud and Francis Bacon, high postmodern literature, any many more texts. We will propose to ask what these narratives can tell us about why we fear the body & its dangers, as well as how that anxiety has changed over time, both in response to changing medical/surgical technology and other developments. These questions will in turn find us asking whether the horrors of embodiment and medicine are inflected by the specificities of the body in question\u2014axes, that is to say, of gender, sex, sexuality, race, and ability. Is there a reason why the overwhelming majority of directors working in medical horror are straight white men? Do depictions of medical aberrations stage and exorcise fears about the otherness about the nonwhite, queer, or female body?

IGA addresses the time bottleneck of mesh generation in FEA by conducting an analysis directly from the exact geometry output by a CAD system.  Beginning with polynomial splines this class develops the analysis techniques followed in FEA, except mesh generation, and applies them to engineering analysis applications via IGA including heat transfer, stress analysis, and vibrations. Then the polynomials are extended to non-uniform-rational-b-splines (NURBS) which lead to the T-splines required to produce refinement regions needed for many 2D and 3D engineering studies. Matlab will be used to define splines, and carry out various applications.\n\nSpring 2024, Section 002: Translational Neuroengineering. This course will cover topics in human motor control, haptic perception, and physical human robot interaction through text and paper readings and discussions. In parallel to the topical readings and discussions, the course will explore the research pipeline, including paper review, writing abstracts, ethics (related to plagiarism, self-citation, and human subjects research), proposal writing, paper writing, and presentation.

        "course_description": "As healthcare costs continue to rise at an alarming rate in U.S. over the past decade (about 20% of GDP by some accounts), issues relating cost measurement and management in the delivery of healthcare have also taken center stage. Experts in business and management have argued that extant cost systems do a poor job of measuring how much it costs to treat patients. Absent accurate measurement of these costs, many decisions could go wrong.  Cost management and efficiency initiatives would be misguided, and medical reimbursements would lack proper cost bases. These concerns have triggered advances in cost measurement and management techniques that are useful not just in the healthcare setting, but also in other service organizations. The purpose of this elective is to help students develop a critical understanding of the nature of costs in healthcare delivery, their measurement in a variety of decision contexts, and how they can be managed and improved. Students will be exposed to tools such as the break-even analysis, role of cost allocations, activity-based costing, time-driven activity based costing, and cost control."

Nevertheless, the best analysis in the world will have little effect if it cannot be communicated to others. Managers must be able to articulate their views coherently and persuasively, and they must be skilled at understanding and critiquing other points of view. Management is a \"verbal sport;\" perhaps 90% of a typical manager's day is consumed by oral communication. Time is often scarce. You must learn to make convincing arguments and to make them quickly, or the merits of your ideas are likely to become simply irrelevant.

Works such as Arnold Schoenberg's Perrot lunaire, Claude Debussy's Jeux, and compositions by American composers Henry Cowell and Charles Ives set the bar for musical modernism that year. But other pieces from France, Germany, Russia, Spain, Hungary and England suggested that the future would present major changes. What did audiences in the United States know about such music? What did they think about it? What did the founders of the Rice Institute think about the new musical trends? How did the music played at the opening festivities of the Rice Institute reflect these perceptions of musical modernism? This course will consider these questions from a variety of parameters and get a sense of \"what modern was\" and its relationship to the momentous events of 1912 in Houston, Texas.

Until recently we have relied on philosophers and religious thinkers for answers to that question, and many of them have provided useful recipes that seem to work for at least some people some of the time. The last century or so has seen many psychologists and self-help gurus who have also handed out (well, more often sold) recipes that generally seem to be less satisfactory than the wisdom of the ancients. Interestingly until recently psychologists have tended to ignore this seeming important topic, but in the past 10 or so years social and personality psychologists, neuroscientists and even economists have begun to pose empirically answerable questions about happiness and to find some data-based answers to what makes people happy. In this course we will read some of the traditional wisdom provided by religious and philosophical thinkers, but we will focus primarily on questions and issues that are subject to empirical resolution.

Is music a \u201cuniversal language\u201d? Why does music so powerfully affect our emotions? Why are some sounds pleasing and others are not? Our goal in this class is to explore what scientific approaches to these questions can tell us about the place of science in the modern world\u2014as well as how and why science has become so important to our imagining of ourselves as thinking, feeling, and willing beings. Armed with this historical knowledge, we will also read recent examples of popular science writing on sound and music a way to think about how we can we become better consumers of scientific knowledge as it is disseminated in the public sphere.

The methodology is analytical, supported by theoretical underpinnings, and illustrated with pertinent case studies. Key theoretical frameworks such as social constructionism, intersectional feminism, and the capability approach will be addressed. Through a series of case studies, students will examine pieces of music by marginalized composers, and films and scholarly works highlighting DEI issues. In addition, they will analyze policies and institutional approaches that have either hindered or fostered diversity and inclusion within the field. Additionally, the course offers opportunities for students to interact with guest scholars, accomplished musicians, and artists from the local community who work on promoting DEI initiatives. The objective of this course is to empower students with the necessary skills to analyze diversity and inclusion issues through the lens of art and music."

        "course_description": "Markets are everywhere today: if you want to find a job, if you want to buy some good, or if you want to sell some service, you will inevitably have to submit yourself to their norms. Yet, this omnipresence of markets raises fundamental ethical questions. Is it really good that we organize exchange and production largely through markets? How are societies and individuals impacted by centrally relying on them? Should we, much rather, prefer a planned economy? Or would such a planned economy unduly constrain people's freedom? And, if we opt for markets, what are their moral limits? Should human organs or access to lawmakers be distributed via a market? Should access to health-care be governed by market principles? This seminar explores these questions through contemporary and historical readings, drawing on a broad set of ideas in order to tackle the philosophical, moral and existential challenges that markets pose."

By contrast, the voices of women philosophers (such as Karoline von G\u00fcnderrode, Bettina von Arnim or Clara Zetkin) are rarely remembered, and even less frequently taught. This course aims to change that. Reading a wide array of texts written by women intellectuals of the time, we will aim to understand their philosophical contributions to German Idealism (e.g. G\u00fcnderrode and Arnim), Feminism (e.g. Zetkin and Hedwig Dohm) and classical Socialism (e.g. Rosa Luxemburg). We will also examine their relationship to, and, more importantly, their critique of the work of some of their male counterparts (such as Fichte, Schelling, Marx and Nietzsche). Finally, we will consider why these women's voices have been so frequently neglected \u2013 and why it is, from a contemporary philosophical standpoint, worthwhile to discover them again."

We will begin with the foundations of political, constitutional, and legal philosophy in Plato and Aristotle.  We will then study the foundations of the common law system, in England,  the theory of the social contract, and the foundations of the democratic constitutional republic in England and the United States. We will explore legal reason and contemporary theories of how it should be used to analyze and decide cases justly and to further the common good.

Theorizing is an activity but also a writing genre. We explore classic and current works in that genre. Finally, we examine the interaction between theory and research practice, via the concept of engaged research, showing that theoretical debates inform more accurate and just research practices.
