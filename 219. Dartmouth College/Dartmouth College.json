European modernity has tended to posit images, sounds, and performances as signs of a world \u201cout there\u201d that recreated in ritual contexts facilitate individual transcendence through an almost spiritual experience. We will examine how West African and African diasporic notions of modern aesthetics tend to offer a counterpoint by enacting theories of representation that are more explicitly performative and socially dialogic. In the 1950s and 1960s people across Africa and African peoples in the Americas and the Caribbean fought for political rights and sovereignty. Aesthetic forms were crucial to these projects. Political power was contested in economic and institutional ways, but people experienced it through their bodies and senses. The power to control political and economic order is enacted in the realms of signs, desires, and value. Moral dichotomies between beautiful or ugly, expensive or cheap, important or illegible, appear to be about aesthetics alone but are in fact ways that power is produced, naturalized, and contested. We examine art media as well as political and social forms as a way to understand how broad forms of power shape both everyday and spectacular experiences and how individuals and collectives use expression as a way to contest the terms of power. In political terms, we explore rituals of state as events through which power is produced and contested in embodied ways. Producing loyal citizens requires a nation-state to create rituals that orient people to feel like they are part of a shared collective experience. This course will draw upon transdisciplinary approaches to understanding aesthetics including ethnographic, literary and theatre studies, political analysis, performance analysis, musicology."

This course seeks to familiarize students with the works of contemporary black political thinkers who have contributed to the rich theoretical developments and productive tensions in Black Studies, discourses on black resistance and freedom struggle, and political action itself. The course focuses on several key concepts\u2014such as civic and social death, sovereignty, the collective unconscious, the radical imagination\u2014as a way to examine notions of agency and the psychic life of racial violence, particularly in the context of the United States. What is the dream-work of Black freedom? And how do dreams of (black) freedom become realized and/or barred from larger socio-political, economic, and legal structures to the more abstract registers of language, aesthetics, culture, and the imagination? The course investigates the theoretical tenets within contemporary Black Studies as critical theory, arguing that these are equally contributive to the continental philosophical tradition on questions of life, rights, civil society, and personhood."

        "course_description": "This interdisciplinary course explores the historical legacy of public rituals of extreme violence against African American peoples as both sites of anti-black state and non-state sanctioned disciplinary projects as well as time-spaces of radical resistance. From the slave trade to life and labor under conditions\u00a0of slavery to post-reconstruction segregation to lynching to police violence, American history can be read through the changing nature of the public torture of Black peoples. At the center of these forms of violence are the control of breath as life force and sign of freedom. This course examines the murder of Eric Garner in 2014 in a police-executed choke hold as a key event that both harkens back to a long history of lynchings and shootings and also to a history of how Black communities have organized around and resisted these forms of violence. Aesthetic representation has been intimately connected to anti-Black racial violence from photographs and postcards of lynchings in which white perpetrators pose alongside dead Black bodies to representations of Emmitt Till\u2019s mutilated body at his funeral in an open casket\u00a0to video of Rodney King\u2019s beating to the continuing stream of video and images of extra-judicial killings of black citizens. Generations of artists in film, theater, painting/sculpture, dance, and across media have challenged and confronted this aesthetics of violence. This course explores theories of ritual and performance to understand how artists and communities come together as collectives to contextualize and re-present impossible terrors. Artists and political organizers use aesthetics and collective action to transform the horror of being subject to violence at any moment into rituals of potential social transformation. This course then teaches students theories of ritual and performance as ways that communities have historically engaged and confronted histories of anti-Black violences in order to conceive of new future possibilities in the face of disciplinary actions meant to contain and choke black people(s). In some manner, the course links African American experiences of violence and resistance to those of other African peoples around the world. This course is team taught and also draws upon the expertise of various faculty at Dartmouth.\u00a0This course aims to link theories of Black life and performance to active practices of performance-making, interrogating the intersections between art and scholarship."

Students will be asked to approach canonical texts (Passing, Beloved, The Color Purple) and less familar texts (A Visitation of Spirits) for messier re-readings, unraveling(s) and ravings that complicate Black life. Likewise, we will watch film adapations that also represent disability and madness on screen (Passing, Beloved, Native Son).\u00a0Because disability and madness are recurrently represented visually, as is race, this course will trace representation from the page to the screen as part of a deeper understanding of how disability and race become co-constituted in American culture. Lastly, we will ask, again and again: what does disability and madness look like in literature? What images, language, etc., are used to represent disability and madness as it intersects with Blackness? And finally, what things are made possible through a disabled and mad lens? How are freedom, injury (and healing), and salvation better imagined through disability and madness?\u00a0"

DuBois\u2019s Souls of Black Folk (1903) and proceeds through successive periods of black cultural apprenticeship in the geopolitical context of the Americas. Those eras may be characterized according to four broad rubrics or temporal themes as follows: 1) the Pan-African movement, pursued as a practice by black activists at the turn of the twentieth century and after the end of WWI; 2) the era of decolonization and the mounting of the Civil and human rights campaigns in the United States, the Caribbean, and independence movements on the Sub-Saharan African Continent, which events share the global context of the \u201cCold War\u201d (from the Marshall Plan to the collapse of the Berlin Wall, 1989, and the dismantling of the Soviet Union, 1991); 3) the birth of the Black Studies movement (alongside the resurgence of black nationalism) and the development of the new epistemologies of the post-\u2018sixties and beyond, and finally 4) the emergence of the concept of the African Diaspora and the post-race/post-colonial thematics of the late twentieth-early twenty-first century, marked by the presidency of Barack Obama. Each of these eras of human and social engagement has engendered its own distinctive work on the idea of black culture. This seminar will examine some of those ideas by analyzing selective texts by W.E.B. DuBois, C.L.R. James, Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, and Frantz Fanon.

Consequently, Rasta is often mistaken for practicing a countercultural phenomenon of no global significance, a poster child for the undesirable other, or merely a misguided rebel. Rastafari however, is significantly more profound. Rastafari has offered, cloaked in revolutionary black hermeneutics, some of the sharpest critiques against European imperialism and exploitation. Despite the presence of burgeoning scholarship, Rasta\u2019s global significance remains hidden in the fissures of most historical discourses and behind the haze of marijuana smoke created by popular understandings of the movement. This course employs monographs, scholarly articles, documentary films and primary sources and music to and explore Rastafarian ideologies that among other things, promoted decolonization while decrying racism and imperialism.

Through an engagement with sound recordings, scholarly writings, journalism, lyrical analysis, film, and other sources, we will expand our understanding of how and why death is so frequently invoked in African American music.\u00a0 Although some reasons for these invocations - for instance, loss or mourning \u2013 may seem obvious, this course will require us to reframe our perceptions of death as simply the ending point of life. As we will learn, death and dying can serve a number of purposes, from \u2018deadness\u2019 serving as a necessary aesthetic for creation, to death being an integral part of an artist\u2019s identity."

To understand the island\u2019s history, students are expected to read what historians and writers have written about Haiti; and to read the primary letters of frantic French planters, rebellious African slaves, egalitarian peasants, entrepreneurial market women, conscientious revolutionaries, exuberant military generals, loquacious politicians, feared dictators, and dreaded militias through time. The course will, indeed, move through four important, though overlapping, historical moments. First, we begin with an examination of the 1791-1804 Haitian Revolution when enslaved Africans revolted against the French colonial planters to successfully abolish slavery and to achieve national independence. Second, we read through the formation of grassroots and institutional democratic traditions in the nineteenth century and how they were undone during the 1915-1934 US Occupation of Haiti, where US President Woodrow Wilson ordered the American military to invade Haiti and control the island for almost two decades. Third, we will explore how the undoing of democracy led to the rise of the Francois and Jean-Claude Duvalier dictatorship (1957-1971) and its dreaded militia called the tonton makout militia (often spelled in the following French orthography: tonton macoutes). Finally, we will conclude the class by looking at how and why the Haitian peasantry overthrew the dictatorship to replace it with the democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide (1991)."

The goal of this course is to better understand the nature of Jews as a genos/race/ethos/people as they are labeled by others as well as how they self-identify. Jews identified as a \u201crace,\u201d and were identified as such by others, until the 1930s, after which ethnos served as a substitute.

The City of Light is arguably one of the most beautiful and exciting destinations in the world. However, all that glitters is not gold. Matters of race and anti-blackness co-exist with a variety of myths, narratives, and representations of Paris and France as color-blind and race-free. Through French film, students will explore these and related issues and thereby gain a broader understanding of pressing social questions, involving anti-racism, belonging, inequality, racism, and their intersections. This course follows a lecture-discussion format."

The selective acquisition, cataloging and exhibition of paintings, sculptures, engravings, photographs, fashion, archeological or ethnographic objects, furniture and decorative art, uses of space, and more not only narrate but also obscure how imperialism, power, and racism are embedded in visual culture.This course explores how art objects in French museum collections bear witness to the history, memory, and legacies of black enslavement in African and its diasporas. The central questions examined in this course include: What is the provenance of these objects? What are the differences across various types of museums in their representation of black enslavement? \u00a0How do the exhibit labels and catalogs, books, and reproductions inform and misinform viewers\u2019 knowledge of the peoples and processes of enslavement? How have museums managed their collections amid public scrutiny and disputes over repatriating and/or redistributing artwork and cultural objects? How have contemporary artists and social justice movements addressed colonial collections in relation to present-day struggles in France? What are the future directions in museum practices? Students will engage with these questions and efforts to decolonize museums and curatorial practices through scholarship, guided tours, excursions, guest speakers, and various assignments designed to explore and analyze these questions."

What does it mean to write oneself into existence if and when knowledge is premised on their epistemic and actual disappearance? This course approaches Black women\u2019s intellectual and cultural production as one entry point into the project of creating from nothing, writing to become, writing as an act of survival, and writing to envision and practice new worlds.

Examining various institutionally structured encounters between Europeans and non-Western peoples we unpack assumptions about the naturalness of power. In postcolonial societies the tensions between ideas of tradition and modernity structure many conflicts over rights, citizenship, and the role of the individual in society."

Was it the War on Drugs, or the long term effects of housing discrimination?\rThis course is designed to explore and explain these questions by unpacking the roles of surveillance, criminalization, policing and incarceration to historical and contemporary US state formation and global capitalism. Proceeding from the idea that carceral geographies such as prison towns, policing, and surveillance are spatial fixes for social, economic, and political crises, we will engage scholarship from a variety of fields including: critical prison studies, geography, cultural studies, gender and sexuality studies, and critical ethnic studies. Students will have an opportunity to understand the historical and contemporary organization of people, places, ideas, and infrastructure that makes up US carceral geographies of the United States.

European modernity has tended to posit images, sounds, and performances as signs of a world \u201cout there\u201d that recreated in ritual contexts facilitate individual transcendence through an almost spiritual experience. We will examine how West African and African diasporic notions of modern aesthetics tend to offer a counterpoint by enacting theories of representation that are more explicitly performative and socially dialogic. In the 1950s and 1960s people across Africa and African peoples in the Americas and the Caribbean fought for political rights and sovereignty. Aesthetic forms were crucial to these projects. Political power was contested in economic and institutional ways, but people experienced it through their bodies and senses. The power to control political and economic order is enacted in the realms of signs, desires, and value. Moral dichotomies between beautiful or ugly, expensive or cheap, important or illegible, appear to be about aesthetics alone but are in fact ways that power is produced, naturalized, and contested. We examine art media as well as political and social forms as a way to understand how broad forms of power shape both everyday and spectacular experiences and how individuals and collectives use expression as a way to contest the terms of power. In political terms, we explore rituals of state as events through which power is produced and contested in embodied ways. Producing loyal citizens requires a nation-state to create rituals that orient people to feel like they are part of a shared collective experience. This course will draw upon transdisciplinary approaches to understanding aesthetics including ethnographic, literary and theatre studies, political analysis, performance analysis, musicology."

Set against the social, political, and devotional contexts of the period, this course explores the transcultural development of the arts across media. In this discussion-based seminar, students will engage with readings that explore early modern art in Europe and its empires. Working directly with the collections of the Hood Museum and other campus resources, students will also learn object-based approaches to art history. Particular attention will be given to material culture, sculpture, decorative arts, and printmaking. Additionally, students will encounter theoretical discourses on exchange, hybridity, hierarchies, and collecting. This seminar will highlight the Dutch Republic, the Habsburg Empire, and their colonies in the Americas, Asia, and Africa. Each week of the seminar will examine themes including: the global circulation of images; the development of national identities; trade in materials; objects as agents of conversion; and conceptions of race. Finally, this course will examine the place of religion and imperialism in the development of collections and museums. As a final project, students will organize an exhibition at the Hood Museum of Art related to the course topic."

        "course_description": "This course examines the relationship between art and industry through the visual and material culture of South Asia from 1800 to the present. The first third of the course will focus on the colonial discourse of art and economy, and the fear that industrial production would destroy indigenous craft and design. This instigated a colonial system of education, and the creation of museums, that taught both the European \u2018fine arts\u2019 of painting and sculpture, and the Indian \u2018applied arts\u2019 of craft and design in practice and in objects. The second third of the course will attend to specific media as physical and intellectual conduits in the economy. We will discuss the explosive effect of the technologies of print and photography in colonial control and nationalist agitation. We will also examine the materiality of textiles, clay, wood, metal, plastic, paper, and food in their production, exhibition display, and cultural and political context. The last third of the course will focus on modern artists\u2019 considerations of art and craft, the formation of national museums, and the contemporary art market. In parallel to the attention to visual and material objects, we will read selections from primary sources on art and industry, such as George C. Birdwood\u2019s Industrial Arts of India (1880), The Journal of Indian Art and Industry, Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s Hind Swaraj (1909), and K. G. Subrahmanyan\u2019s Eclecticism (1992)."

The course consists largely of four themes: the Silk Road and the Arts, the Pottery Stories, the Jesuits and the Arts, and Asian Arts in Europe. The class starts with the Silk Road, the world\u2019s first great superhighway that from ancient times linked East Asia to the Mediterranean World across Central Asia, and examines how ideas, art, and religions traveled and were transformed through their journey. The second theme, the Porcelain stories, conveys how aesthetics, technology, designs and motifs were transmitted from East to West and vice versa. We will ask questions, such as: Why was porcelain so desirable? Where did porcelain rank in the hierarchy of art forms and materials in Asia and Europe? How much did a piece of porcelain cost at any moment in time? Why did Japan and Korea have \u201cthe Pottery War\u201d and what was the significance of that war in East Asia (and Europe)? The third theme, the Jesuits and the Arts, looks at the hybrid blend of two or more traditions and the artistic productions that arose from those blends. We also will examine together the paintings of Asian and European artists, the paintings of European artists on Asian themes with a traditional Asian medium, and the work of Asian painters\u2019 on European subject matter with a European medium. The last theme, Asian art in Europe, scrutinizes the Western reception of Asian subjects, motifs, designs, and aesthetic values, and their appropriation for artistic productions. European interpretation (or imitation) of Chinese arts, so called Chinoiseries, and the Japanese influence on European art, known as Japonism, will be closely examined. Through lectures, readings, and films, we will explore the historical and artistic links between East and West and some selected art associated with those routes. This course requires no previous experience, but is intended for those who like interdisciplinary approaches to art and culture. No previous coursework is required."

The aristocracies that had ruled the West for a millennium, withered as the bourgeoisie and working classes struggled for control. The optimism of the Enlightenment slowly soured into the brooding inwardness of Romantic melancholia. The rise of mass industrial production and consumption would be accompanied by waves of technological and social change that irrevocably altered daily life. European powers pursued global dominance through colonial expansion with renewed vigor and brutality. This course examines these epochal changes through the lends of European cultural production, covering key artistic movements such as the Rococo, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, and Realism.

One of the main objectives of the course is to look at art practices that attempt to deepen our understanding of the varied cultures, ethnicities and societies that are found in this part of the world. The geographic focus of the course\u2013mostly the Muslim nations of the Arabian peninsula and North Africa\u2013is not meant to perpetuate the assumptions about this region as a monolithic geopolitical entity, nor to blindly label its production according to existing ethnic, religious or national categories. Against media stereotypes of the region, the artists studied in this course have made work that function as a critical platform for rethinking traditional identity formations and extending the space of cultural encounter across borders (territorial, political, linguistic). In many cases these artists may not be living and working in their country of birth but their ethnicity, religion or citizenship continues to inform both their own sense of identity and the terms of their art practice. Some of the topics to be discussed include: artistic responses to the Arab-Israeli conflict, representations of everyday life in times of war, the movement and obstruction of people, goods and information across borders, the rise of new art markets in the Middle East, the politics of gender and sexuality in the Arab world, and the of use archival documents to rethink the meaning of evidence, truth and testimony."

        "course_description": "One could imagine that in the 1970s, the architectural movement known as the International Style looked back at the twentieth century with glee, surveying its spoils. It was after all, a style of architecture that held the century in thrall for almost 50 years; determining the built forms for much of the world in steel, glass and concrete. Le Corbusier for instance, likened architecture to a machine with parts that could be erected and function anywhere. Yet voices arose to articulate local architectural responses to such a paradigm, where the interrelationship between self, place, identity and home needed to be articulated in built form. The phrase that became the rallying cry for such a movement was \u201cCritical Regionalism\u201d and this course analyzes how many architectural projects in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas embodied an approach to a more humane architecture."

We will pay particular attention to the role of satire in modern art as it employed irony, parody, ridicule and exaggeration to attack social mores, political figures and the art world status quo. We will also explore the use of satire in film and TV, from the darkly comic (Charlie Chaplin) to the ridiculous (Stephen Colbert).

        "course_description": "Since the advent of industrial capitalism, humans have released 555 petagrams of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, increasing CO2 concentrations to a level not seen for at least 800,000 years. The long-term consequences of these atmospheric changes remain unknown, but there is already strong evidence that the Earth is rapidly moving into a less biologically diverse, less forested, much warmer, and probably wetter and stormier state. Research on climate change points to a particular irony: human actions have unprecedented impact on the environment, but this produces effects that are increasingly out of human control. Inside that conundrum lies another. Scientists have certain strategies to address urgent environmental challenges, but what of the arts and the humanities? What can practitioners in these fields, in dialogue with the sciences, offer in this moment of climatic disruption and political inaction? To what new modes of visualization does global warming give rise, and how do these aesthetic innovations allow us to live with and through environmental change? What ontological status can be assigned to various biological, geological, and meteorological \u2018actors\u2019 if human agency is no longer privileged?In taking up these questions, this course recognizes that the manifold effects of climate change demand new structures of cross-disciplinary thinking and critical engagement. Accordingly, it draws on concepts and methods drawn from art history and critical theory as well as science and anthropology. As we will see, the field of contemporary art does not simply project forward to predicted catastrophic future scenarios. Rather, it foregrounds the unique capacities of humans to imagine scenarios or worlds that have not yet come into existence.\u00a0 What, in essence, can art help us imagine that science alone cannot? Through this line of enquiry, this course asks what it means to think through the possibilities and limits of our planet beyond a pessimistic orientation towards foreclosed futures."

        "course_description": "This Advanced Seminar addresses legal issues that pertain to the sale, acquisition, display, ownership, and destruction of works of art. The topic is framed around two related questions: How does the special status of art, as a privileged sphere of creative expression, grant it different treatment under the law? What are some of the exemptions, protections, or obligations that are accorded to art that are not extended to other forms of personal property? The first part of the course will focus on case studies in which legal questions are entangled with ethical and political concerns: illicit international trade in looted art, repatriation claims, high-profile forgeries, and new guidelines for authentication. The second half looks at the legal framework that governs artists\u2019 rights (including resale royalties, copyright, and freedom of expression) as well as the rules that structure transactions in the primary (e.g. artist-dealer contracts and handshake agreements) and secondary art markets. We will also analyze problems related to the representation of artists\u2019 estates, the acquisition and de-accessioning of artworks by museums, and the tax codes associated with charitable contributions of works of art. Finally, the class considers how artists strategically make use of the unique affordances of the law and test what it is that artworks can do outside the circumscribed domain of the art world."

        "course_name": "Art and Life! Avant-garde techniques, 1890-1970",
        "course_description": "For many artists in the late nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, the relationship between everyday lived experience and artistic practice required urgent rethinking and rearrangement. In addition to objecting to the modern systematization of life, work, and love, artists bristled against the notion that art had become just another thing to be admired, collected, bought and sold. This course examines the histories, interventions, and aspirations of this particular thread of avant-garde practice.\u00a0 We will pay special attention to the interventions and ideas of women artists and artist collectives as they sought to challenge standards of bourgeois respectability and the status of the hallowed singular art object.\u00a0 We will attend to the powerful critiques they offered against the standardization of life under capitalism and in the art world; we will consider the politics of avant-gardism, both in terms of its negativity, its occasional alignment with war and fascism, and some of its patriarchal and imperialist tendencies.\u00a0 We will also consider its positive utopian aspects, including its cultivation of liberatory politics and the clearing of space for new patterns of thought aligned with practices of equality, peace, and new possibilities for art. In addition to studying the techniques of historical avant-gardes in a classical academic/art historical sense, the course asks students to adopt and/or imagine what it would mean to stake out an avant-garde position relative to their own embodied experience as students in the space of Dartmouth's campus.\u00a0 Active learning activities will include the writing, printing, and distribution of manifestos, group derives, and other psychogeographic, surrealist and Fluxus-inspired collective experiments.\u00a0 The course will culminate with the \u201creinvention\u201d of one of Allan Kaprow\u2019s happenings, Fluids (1967) (pending Leslie Center Humanities Lab funding) in order to allow students to test out some of the theories we studied in class and perhaps make necessary adjustments for the needs to the present."

A student interested in undertaking Independent Study must first submit a proposal to the faculty member with whom he or she wishes to study. Assuming agreement by that faculty member, the proposal will then be reviewed by the entire Art History faculty. Ordinarily, this must be done in the term immediately preceding the term in which the Independent Study course will be taken.

The course consists largely of four themes: the Silk Road and the Arts, the Pottery Stories, the Jesuits and the Arts, and Asian Arts in Europe. The class starts with the Silk Road, the world\u2019s first great superhighway that from ancient times linked East Asia to the Mediterranean World across Central Asia, and examines how ideas, art, and religions traveled and were transformed through their journey. The second theme, the Porcelain stories, conveys how aesthetics, technology, designs and motifs were transmitted from East to West and vice versa. We will ask questions, such as: Why was porcelain so desirable? Where did porcelain rank in the hierarchy of art forms and materials in Asia and Europe? How much did a piece of porcelain cost at any moment in time? Why did Japan and Korea have \u201cthe Pottery War\u201d and what was the significance of that war in East Asia (and Europe)? The third theme, the Jesuits and the Arts, looks at the hybrid blend of two or more traditions and the artistic productions that arose from those blends. We also will examine together the paintings of Asian and European artists, the paintings of European artists on Asian themes with a traditional Asian medium, and the work of Asian painters\u2019 on European subject matter with a European medium. The last theme, Asian art in Europe, scrutinizes the Western reception of Asian subjects, motifs, designs, and aesthetic values, and their appropriation for artistic productions. European interpretation (or imitation) of Chinese arts, so called Chinoiseries, and the Japanese influence on European art, known as Japonism, will be closely examined. Through lectures, readings, and films, we will explore the historical and artistic links between East and West and some selected art associated with those routes.

Vergil\u2019s famous phrase \u201clove conquers all\u201d (omnia uincit amor, Eclogues 10.69) encapsulates the centrality of amor to the poetic genre of elegy. But the notion of love as a conquering force also hints at its ability to overwhelm, subdue, and destroy. The idea of love, broadly conceived, is embedded in the literature, philosophy, scientific thought, religion, and art and archaeology of the Romans. We will explore love in its various forms \u2013 devotion, lust, physical sexuality, friendship, and familial bonds \u2013 by looking at the central authors and genres of the Latin literary tradition (in English translation). Our discussion of these core texts will be further enriched by an examination of additional ancient sources, including Greek and Roman visual art, monuments and architecture, coins, and inscriptions."

Classics was an early adopter of digital technologies, and computation is now pervasive throughout the field, as illustrated by flagship projects such as the Perseus Digital Library. Beyond the familiar examples of digitized texts and simple word searches, scholars and students also benefit from an ever-growing array of sophisticated quantitative tools, and from increasing engagement with diverse technical disciplines \u2013 natural language processing, data science, even bioinformatics. Through a survey of recent research at the intersection of Latin literature and the digital humanities, this course will introduce you to the state of the art in quantitative literary criticism. To ground our methodological investigations, we will explore a diverse selection of Latin poetry, including epic (Vergil, Lucan, and Catullus), elegy (Catullus), and comedy (Plautus), and sample some less famous later authors, such as Paul the Deacon and Vitalis of Blois, who were influenced by classical antecedents. At each turn, we will examine the interplay between traditional (close reading, philology, theory) and data-driven analyses of Latin literature and consider how quantitative methods can support humanistic inquiry. Along the way, you will gain hands-on experience with powerful computational tools and be introduced to now ubiquitous critical approaches, such as intertextuality and reception studies. Assigned readings will be in English translation using bilingual Latin-English editions; in addition to reading all of the English, students with Latin will be responsible for understanding and translating \u201cmicro samples\u201d of the original texts.

Sparta was famed for its army, Corinth for its navy. Spartans were known for the simplicity of their lifestyle and the architectural simplicity of their city, whereas Corinthians overtly enjoyed luxuries and erected some of the Greeks\u2019 earliest large-scale stone temples. By comparing and contrasting Sparta and Corinth, we can develop a good sense of the Greek world during the Archaic period."

This course examines slave systems in the ancient and modern worlds comparatively, focusing on Rome and Brazil. In Rome, the emergence of the state, including the development of the concept of the citizen, coincided with the development of the slave society. African slavery in Brazil was introduced soon after the establishment of the colonial government and drew heavily from classical legal definitions. In this course we compare the social and political structures of these two slave systems (high art, popular culture, institutions). We examine how each slave society was legitimated, perpetuated-and ultimately challenged. Specific topics include: the construction of the slave and the emergence of racializing discourse, the slave trade and the commodification of the body, trickster narratives, modern theories of power and domination, resistance and rebellion, and the problem of freedom for previously dominated peoples. Through comparison, students will not only become aware of the similarities between these two slave societies, but will also be better equipped to evaluate their unique qualities and particular achievements."

How did later Romans remember and heroize the events that led to their supremacy?\u00a0 We will trace this remarkable transformation through both science and literature: the physical evidence recovered through archaeology, and literary accounts in Greeks' and Romans' prose and poetry that tell stories of Rome's foundation and struggle for survival. Readings include passages from Virgil's Aeneid and Livy's History of Rome, as well as excerpts from ancient writers that include Dionysius, Strabo, Plutarch, Cicero and Ovid."

This course begins with a close look at the first emperor, Augustus, then continues with an examination of the reigns of the Julio-Claudians, Flavians, and Trajan. Discussion focuses on how ancient Italic traditions were transformed to suit the needs of the Imperial government (for example, the adaptation of the Republican, Hellenized Domus to the Imperial Palatia). The most dramatic change in religious practice is the development of the Imperial cult. Site analysis will stress the need for an imperial idiom, the accommodation of urban masses and the promotion of a sense of a shared cultural experience. The course will also examine the technological developments that led to Rome's \"architectural revolution.\" May be taken in partial fulfillment of the major in Art History. "

Sparta conquered much of the southern Peloponnese and became a militarized society with an economy based almost entirely on agriculture. Corinth\u2019s territory was, compared to that of Sparta, minuscule, but it became a powerful and wealthy community through the foundation of numerous colonies and commerce. Sparta was famed for its army, Corinth for its navy. Spartans were known for the simplicity of their lifestyle and the architectural simplicity of their city, whereas Corinthians overtly enjoyed luxuries and erected some of the Greeks\u2019 earliest large-scale stone temples. By comparing and contrasting Sparta and Corinth, we can develop a good sense of the Greek world during the Archaic period."

Drawing on this body of research and our respective specialties, we explore the language-music connection from the basic ingredients (pitch, timbre, rhythm, syntax), to cultural expression, to evolution and origins. Running through the course is a hands-on case study of a West African xylophone tradition where language and music are so intimately related that they cannot be separated.

This course introduces students to the problems of color from both the painter\u2019s and the philosopher\u2019s perspective. Students will gain familiarity with philosophical theories of color as well as theories of color sourced in painting. They will develop the ability to work with paint and chromatic light so as to bring about different effects. And they will learn how materials such as paints and lights might be brought together into works.

Between the early 1920s and the early 1950s, some 25 million people were arrested and sent to the so-called \u201ccorrection-labor\u201d camps to perform back breaking work under the most inhumane conditions. The focus of this course is on the history and culture of the Stalin labor camps. Beginning with the violence inflicted by the young Bolshevik regime on the Russian people, we will examine the creation of a network of camps during the \u201cgreat terror\u201d of 1937-1938 and the economic, political, and cultural features of the camps, through such topics as work, food, camp administration and guards, the relationship between the \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d and the common criminals, the special plight of women, the hardening of conditions in the camps during and after World War II and the zenith of the GULAG in the early 1950s. Finally, the course will examine the GULAG\u2019s demise and the experience of dissidents in the camps of the 1960s-1980s; the way modern-day Russia deals with the memory of the camps; and GULAG-style camps in several socialist countries."

BIOL 56 is a continuation of BIOL 55; these courses comprise the first two-thirds of the FSP, and focus on land (tropical forests) and tropical freshwater ecosystems in Costa Rica. BIOL 57 focuses on coral reef ecosystems in the Caribbean. Students are challenged to know, understand and appreciate the diversity of form and function in organisms, and the interactions that generate the often-spectacular patterns they see in the field. Habitats in Costa Rica include lowland rain forest, cloud forest, dry forest, montane forest, alpine paramo, streams and wetlands. The schedule is full, including fieldwork, laboratories, lectures and discussions, with emphasis on original research, mostly in small groups of 2-3. Faculty and advanced graduate TAs share field accommodations with students, and are in continuous contact as mentors, day and evening, throughout the program. Students master field and analytical methods (including hypothesis testing, statistical and software skills) for observational and experimental research. We pursue a great variety of research topics, including plant-pollinator and plant-herbivore interactions, processes driving coral reef structure (and coral reef decline), determinants of species distributions, animal behavior, and conservation ecology. Students practice the classic scientific approach: making observations, asking testable questions, generating hypotheses, developing experimental protocols, collecting data, making statistical inferences, writing scientific papers, and presenting seminars. Research papers are published in an annual book. Accommodations are at field stations in Costa Rica, and at a marine laboratory in the Caribbean.\u00a0 Acceptance into Program is required.\u00a0 In addition, BIOL 15 & BIOL 29 are recommended."

In fact, the very question of \u201cwhat is a gene?\u201d is even being reconsidered, as the fundamental unit of genomic organization appears not to be the classical DNA-based \u201cgene\u201d but instead is the RNA-based transcript.\u00a0 In this course we will explore these issues and more through lectures, literature discussions, student-led presentations, and student writing assignments.\u00a0"

Both men\u2014as well as many others involved in the case--came from local towns in Roman Italy. The stakes for conviction: loss of civic status, essentially a social death. Cicero\u2019s defense of his client provides a masterly example of courtroom defense strategies (the mustering of evidence, witness testimony, manipulation of legal procedures) and the courtroom story-telling that created presumptive realities of \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201ctruth,\u201d of \u201cinnocence\u201d or \u201dguilt.\u201d\u00a0 The speech thus affords insight into questions of Roman courtroom procedure and judicial integrity, of the assimilation of Italians within the Roman social and political community and access to Roman law, and of the social expectations"

In addition to the thematic, the course offers an extensive and diverse (but not exhaustive) survey of Sufism\u2019s impact on literary genres.Some of the questions we will ask in this course include: what happens to Sufi concepts when they cross linguistic borders? Can we speak of multiple literary Sufisms? What about Sufism appealed to various authors? How did authors incorporate Sufi elements into their craft? What kind of worldview did it help them develop? How did literary adaptations of Sufism map over already-existing local mystical and aesthetic traditions?Advanced reading ability in a second language is preferred but not required as all class materials are available in English."

We begin by discussing the properties of air and a few basic physical principles that control all atmospheric phenomena. These principles enable us to understand weather systems and associated fronts, clouds, winds, and precipitation, and to forecast weather using simple visual observations, satellite data and supercomputers. They are also the basis for the global circulation of air, energy and water, as well as the restlessly changing, diverse climate zones of our planet. Labs will provide hands-on experience observing the weather, building and using simple meteorological instruments, interpreting network data and satellite images, and forecasting the weather in real time. Additional topics may include air pollution, deliberate and inadvertent weather and climate modification, aviation and marine weather, and atmospheric chaos."

Since different agents can have different recommendations, we would want a protocol by which they can arrive at an \"agreement\" on whether the plane should go left, right, or straight. How hard is it to design such a protocol? It turns out that if you want the protocol to be fault-tolerant, i.e., the protocol works correctly even if one of the agents stops communicating, it is impossible to design a correct protocol (under certain reasonable assumptions about the system).In the course, we will look at several fascinating coordination problems and solve them for several models of distributed computing: shared-memory versus message passing, synchronous versus asynchronous, fault-free versus fault-tolerant.

However, another fundamental question is: why do governments do what they do? This course considers governments as economic actors. We will theoretically and empirically investigate how social decisions are made; why governments fail; why different levels of government (federal, state, local) fund different public goods and services; and how governments at different levels interact. Topics to be covered include externalities and public goods, political economy, and fiscal federalism. K-12 education in the United States will provide a detailed case study, though other applications may be considered from time to time. Course involves an empirical project."

Do they take revolutionary forms or structures? To what extent are the texts participating in the same public sphere and historical moment? In responding to these questions, this colloquium will read literary texts (by Gaskell, Dickens, Emily Bronte, Christina Rossetti, Browning, and Tennyson) alongside artistic and political manifestos, popular political poetry, visual images, scientific and critical prose, and contemporary literary criticism (feminist, Marxist, psychoanalytic, poststructuralist).

        "course_description": "There is a significant period of modernization in US culture from about 1850-1920\u2014a decade before the Civil War to the aftermath of World War I, encompassing Reconstruction, the Gilded Age, the devastating relocation of indigenous Americans, and the development of film and photography\u2014which coincides with one of the most definitive and transformative passages in American self-identity, yet which is under-studied compared to the antebellum period (late 18th-early 19th century) and the period of \u201chigh modernism\u201d (1920s-40s). Perhaps part of the reason is that what counts as modernity in these years is not yet modernism, but a process (always debatable) of \u201cbecoming-modern,\u201d as if half the time there is a lingering preoccupation with pre-Civil War modes of life and the other half looks forward to a period of explosive economic growth and cultural change. Notably, this transitional period is when philosophical and scientific theories of survival, evolution, and inheritance of various sorts became predominant, alongside experiences of renewed racial violence, horrific catastrophes, economic turbulence, and political (dis)enfranchisement. By the early twentieth century, the psychiatric language of \u201ctrauma\u201d dominated the understanding of subjectivity and the language of survival accordingly expands to include various forms of lingering, shock, strangeness, and disturbance that would soon take their place as hallmarks of the aesthetics of modernism. Tracking these currents, this course investigates episodes of survival from the personal (war, sexual assault, grief), the institutional (Jim Crow, Social Darwinism), historical (survivals of the Civil War, slavery) and media-technological (photography and film), in search of a definition of US modernity as a mode of transitional experience."

The period witnessed the expansion of photography, the popularity of pseudo-sciences such as physiognomy and phrenology, and the \u201cscientific\u201d study of race\u2014disciplines that focused on the policing of a material body.\u00a0At the same time, the Victorian period witnessed\u00a0the emergence of an alternative vector of realism that rejected an emphasis on the\u00a0\u201cseen\u201d and expanded the categories of who and what could be represented: women, industrial workers, and people of color.

Yet motherhood shares an intimate relationship with shifting, culturally specific histories of colonialism, nationalism, militarism, and more recently, globalization. Motherhood, and social reproduction more broadly, has served as a critical domain of power and knowledge production in these contexts. Because the experience of mothering connects the intimate experiences of individuals to larger structures and forces, and because reproduction is such a fundamental (if varied) biological and social experience, the topic lends its especially well to comparative analysis.This specific course employs the framework of mothering to compare the experiences of two communities constructed as \u201cforeign\u201d to the United States: Chicanx/Latinxs and Asian Americans. In situating motherhood as an ideological and cultural construction rather than a universal or natural phenomenon, we will compare closely affiliated histories of miscegenation, transracial adoption, domestic migrant labor, and assisted reproduction across the Americas and the Asian diaspora. How are these phenomena given especially potent life in Chicanx/Latinx, Asian American, and Asian diasporic cultural representations such as literature, documentary film, and television? In analyzing major scholarship and theories about mothering alongside these cultural texts, we will learn how differing notions of motherhood have been constructed, contested, and negotiated."

And while no one reads Stevens for his \u201cbric-a-brac\u201d many readers come to Frost for his subjects, which have been misunderstood and sentimentalized over time. It is important to remember, reading him now, that Frost\u2019s New England was no Transcendental retreat, and no rural paradise; poor, depopulated by western expansion on the one hand, and the industrialization of mill towns on the other, it was a landscape of failed and abandoned farmsteads, old people and misfits left to fend on their own, worn-out fields, harsh climate, intellectually moribund and spiritually enervated. Frost came to this \u201csubject\u201d without illusions or bitterness and it is through this subject that we will begin to rethink his poetics and ideas. Using the extensive Frost archives in Rauner, students will be encouraged to undertake primary research alongside their reading of poems and criticism.

We also ask what these aesthetic and theoretical traditions offer us now, during the \u201cAnthropocene\u201d or the current epoch when humans have become a geological force shaping the Earth. We ask whether or not they have the potential to interpret it from a different perspective, whether or not they can inform environmentalist politics, and what their implications might be for social justice.

But hypocrisy or faithlessness aside, is it possible that we have never really understood what we mean when we speak of an entitlement to life, or even the value of life such? If life is valuable, and supremely significant, could it be because we think nonliving matter is without value? And yet, no living being is entirely independent of the nonliving\u2014we are composed as much of nonliving matter as of thriving communities of microorganisms. Moreover, as subjects of law, institutions, and culture, we regularly invest ourselves in non-vital symbolic systems that will outlive us, like building a future for others or leaving a legacy behind.

What is the relationship between walking and time, walking and place? Why should walking have emerged, in certain works of contemporary literature, as a principled rejection of mechanization, modernity, and the capitalist mode of production? And what does walking mean for those who cannot walk? To address these questions, students will read texts by such practitioners and theorists of walking as Thoreau, Walter Benjamin, W. G. Sebald, Rebecca Solnit, Simon Armitage, Robert MacFarlane, Geoff Nicholson, and others. Students will also use their own walks as opportunities for composing works of critical self-reflection, observation, and world-making."

But in the literature of the period there are many social and literary struggles which took their tolls in the madness and suicide of writers such as Smart and Chatterton, the difficulties of attaining creative freedom, and the emergence of new literary forms such as the Gothic. This course will trace the fortunes of writers such as Samuel Johnson, James Boswell, Oliver Goldsmith, and Edmund Burke as they grapple with the anxieties of their time. We will also consider how women thinkers and novelists such as Charlotte Lennox and Mary Wollstonecraft forged new roles for themselves, and we may include studies of the novel of political paranoia such as Caleb Williams, written by Wollstonecraft's husband, William Godwin."

At the same time, however, the prospect of revolutionary violence made the imagination a dangerous, and intensely debated faculty, as promising as it was potentially pathological, and as likely to produce a Gothic nightmare as a pastoral utopia. This course will examine the richly varied forms of literary and political experience that emerge out of this moment, and that continue to shape modern conceptions of creativity, sexuality, ecology and social transformation. Readings include works by William Blake, William Wordsworth, Percy and Mary Shelley, John Keats, and Thomas de Quincey."

Then, we will read the work of postcolonial thinkers, such as Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak, and Homi Bhabha, to consider their critiques of colonial thought and practices.

The unprecedented fusion Dante made of these elements in the Commedia [The Divine Comedy] has guaranteed his great poem a vast public, extending across world cultures and the seven centuries since it initially traveled among elite readers in north-central Italy in the early decades of the fourteenth century. This course will first examine the development of Dante\u2019s poetic voice in La vita nova [The New Life, ca. 1293-94] and then focus on its subsequent expansion into an all-encompassing vision of life and death in Inferno [Hell, ca. 1306-09], the first of the three canticles of the Commedia. Situating Dante in his own time and place will be essential to our analysis of his poetry, but attention to the multiple ways that Dante\u2019s work has been interpreted, translated, and appropriated in other periods, languages, and media will provide a critical framework for understanding its enduring appeal, why \u2013 in the words of Italo Calvino \u2013 it \u201chas not finished saying what it has to say.\u201d Readings, lectures, discussion, and written work \u2013 to include a mid-term exam, two short essays, and a final digital project \u2013 will be in English.

Increasing human demand for Earth\u2019s limited resources has resulted in a plethora of hazards to the natural world; problems which are unlikely to be solved without understanding the links between human and natural systems. Here, we will explore some of the complex, sometimes non-intuitive behavior that results from coupling these systems. The primary objective is to introduce students to the tools and techniques of complex systems science used for researching coupled human-natural systems. In a series of lectures and computer laboratory modules, students will be introduced to significant areas of research in the field and learn how to analyze and leverage basic continuous and discrete time differential models and spatiotemporal statistics to address socio-ecological problems. The course will provide basic coding instruction, as necessary. No prior experience in coding is needed. In a final project, students will work in groups to develop or adapt an existing socio-ecological model, gather and analyze existing data, as well as interpret the implications of their results for human management."

In this course we will study some pairings of connected Celtic and English/Anglo-Norman texts, as well as contemporary writing about the Celtic connection. The politics of these exchanges are not easy. There were wars and border skirmishes; the Norman and Angevin kings of England sought to subdue the Celtic kingdoms and extend their political influence by diplomacy, coercion and conquest, creating a dynamic that is in some ways parallel to, but also interestingly different from a modern Colonial/Postcolonial situation. Readings may include early Arthurian material; Diarmaid and Grainne and the Anglo-French Tristan romances; Geoffrey of Monmouth's Life of Merlin and Merlinesque prophecies; the Welsh Mabinogi; lais by Marie de France and other writers; the borderland romance \"Fulk Fitz Warren\"; the anecdotes, satires and short romances of Walter Map; Gerald of Wales's ethnographic descriptions/ travelogues of Wales and Ireland.

        "course_description": "This course will study the aesthetic phenomenon and social ritual of forgiveness through readings from the second half of Shakespeare\u2019s career. In early modern England, the Protestant reformation had radically reshaped the dominant religious rituals of penance, confession, and absolution. Scholars have often argued that some of the traditions abolished, such as the richly imagined world of purgatory or the importance of intercessory forms of forgiveness, were sublimated into the secular drama of Shakespeare\u2019s stage. Our syllabus will test this argument by following Shakespeare\u2019s turn from revenge toward romance, \u201cproblem plays\u201d and dark comedies. Readings in history, critical theory (Foucault on man as \u201cconfessing animal\u201d), language philosophy (including J.L. Austin\u2019s How to Do Things with Words), and forays into contemporary fiction (including Miriam Toews\u2019 Women Talking) will inform and broaden our discussions. Is forgiveness differently satisfying or unsatisfying in life or in art? How do aesthetic experiences of reconciliation affect society? Ultimately our goal will be to track the alternative norms and sources of normativity revealed by a philological inquiry into cultural and literary texts as well as socio-linguistic practices whose contemporary analogues might include the confession booth, the rhetoric of the public apology, or the discourse of restorative justice today."

It had also become bound up with a range of anxieties fixated on cultural decadence, racial degeneration, transgressive sexuality, political revolution and the occult. This course will study a series of novels that foreground these issues, including Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, George Gissing's New Grub Street, George Du Maurier's Trilby and Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent.

Using that question \u2014 a question that, in its very persistence, already crystalizes all that is most troubling, provocative, and intriguing about the Freudian text \u2014 students in this class will read Freud for his enduring value as the inventor, in psychoanalysis, of one of modernity\u2019s most disturbing art forms, as an influential theorist of figuration and representation, as a fearless inquirer into the mysteries of gender and sexuality, and as a speculative thinker who continues to have a hold on our imagination precisely because he could never quite come to grips with all that had a hold on his imagination.

Readings from Angela Davis, Michel Foucault, and Nicole Fleetwood (among others) will frame our comparative inquiry; classics such as Robinson Crusoe will be cast in a different light. Recurring topics will include writings from confinement as genre; the importance of print culture inside and outside the prison; the relation between carceral institutions and literary genres such as the convict narrative, epistle, early realist novel, and lyric poem. Throughout we will pay particular attention to how literary writing has been a recurring means for thinking outside the confines of a given political discourse, while we also reconsider the links between confinement and imagination, rehabilitation and subjectivity, art and liberation, then and now."

        "course_description": "This module of FR10 proposes a study of tragedy in French literature, from classical theatre and poetry to the modern novel and film that explores tragedy as a mode of representation for the following aesthetic, political, and philosophical dilemmas/questions: in what circumstances is suffering meaningful? Is the relationship to the past (where curses, warnings, and prophecies are uttered and ghosts lie waiting) always invariably tragic? Does the law (or the State) produce tragedy? In what ways are affects or states of dispossession such as mourning and rage at the heart of tragedy? What does the tragic teach us about the relationship between contingency and destiny, between our capacity as agents to act and the unforeseeable, unpredictable consequences of our actions, about our desire to experience sympathy or even solidarity with those who find themselves falling outside of the bounds of social and symbolic order?Students in FR10 will hone rhetorical and interpretative competency over 2 short papers, 2 quizzes, lead discussions on texts in class, and continue to work on structuring and presenting arguments in the genre of literary analysis in the frame of a final paper for the course.Readings include: Racine (Phe\\u0300dre), Balzac (Adieu); Baudelaire (Les Fleurs du Mal; Spleen de Paris); Voltaire (Candide); Camus (L\u2019Ho\\u0302te); Sartre (Le Mur); Perec (W, ou le souvenir d\u2019enfance); Ladj Ly (Les Mise\\u0301rables); Hannah Arendt; Etienne Balibar; Jean-Pierre Vernant and Pierre Vidal-Naquet; Nicole Loraux; Plato; Simon Critchley; Raymond Williams."

As we read texts from each period, we will discover different versions of the Atlantic world, one that exists between many French Atlantic spaces: Caribbean, North American, African, and European. Across these representations, the Atlantic exists as a prism through which authors investigate cross-cultural romance, cultural practices, and the relative notions of beauty. The Atlantic also emerges to prominence during France\u2019s first empire. Before the eighteenth century, the Mediterranean, as an imaginary space of empire and cross-cultural contact, eclipses the Atlantic. As the first and then the second French Empire grows, the Atlantic world takes on a stronger presence in the French imaginary."

What one finds there, in other words, is less \u201cfilthy\u201d material per se than a stylistics that opens up space for dangerously unruly sociocritical readings; that brings into visibility and legibility desires and subjectivities typically confined in the nineteenth century to the\u00a0grisaille silencieuse\u00a0of \u201cHistory\u2019s\u201d margins; and that seeks to bring out into representation repressed historical and political traumas occasioned by the \u201cshocks\u201d of modernity (Benjamin).

We will begin with a basic question \u2013 what and where is the Middle East? \u2013 prior exploring the impact, importance and mechanics of empires (Ottoman, French, British). Once elucidating this imperial backdrop, we will study sweeping reforms, struggles for independence, and the fashioning of nation-states, before examining a series of revolutionary moments, America\u2019s presence in the Middle East, and the \u201cArab Spring\u201d and its aftermath. Whenever possible, we will strive to illuminate ordinary people, as opposed to only elite actors, who contributed to the making of the modern Middle East."

Dictatorship is usually described as a strongman imposing his will on the nation through sheer force. French political philosopher \u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie (1530\u20131563) in his seminal essay Discours de la servitude volontaire (Discourse on Voluntary Servitude) presented the existence of a dictatorship as a relationship between two parties. Before every dictator is a population that is willing to accept rule by the dictator. The dictator cannot impose his will on a people that shun a dictatorship. Extrapolating from this concept, we can consider dictatorship to be a syndrome. The dictionary defines a syndrome as \u201ca group of signs and symptoms that occur together and characterize a particular abnormality or condition.\u201d In this course, students will examine the condition, signs, symptoms, and cures for the malady of dictatorship."

Where should food be produced and how? What forms of agricultural can meet global need in the immediate term and over the long run? And what systems of trade and global governance are needed to feed the world? In this course, we dive into these debates from a policy and political science perspective.We first learn the basics about how farming and food production is organized in different parts of the world, as well as how international food trade is structured, and we become familiar with the major challenges created by existing food and farming systems. We then consider the many political and policy solutions being offered to address these challenges and weigh their costs and benefits to form our own educated conclusion about the best way forward to feed the world.We further delve into the politics of food, asking how access to food and support for or attacks on farming are used to achieve political aims. For example, we examine how governments use restrictive food trade policies to accomplish foreign policy goals and how rebel groups appropriate humanitarian food aid to finance civil wars. Overall, the course illustrates just how central food and farming are to politics."

Fast forward 30 years, and his prediction seems na\u00efve. Observers around the world warn of imminent threats to democracy in both Western and non-Western countries, and non-democratic powers like China and Russia offer alternative forms of governance that appeal to many global leaders. Democracy seems to be eroding.This course asks whether, in fact, liberal democracy is being displaced by other forms of governance. Is democracy in the world eroding? If so, what does democratic erosion in the contemporary period look like, why is it happening, and how does it differ from processes of democratic breakdown in earlier historical periods? If processes of democratic erosion are underway, how can they be resisted and democracy strengthened? To address these questions, this course explores democratic breakdown and erosion in comparative and historical perspective. We examine countries from around the world, using readings from academic and media sources to examine both empirical and normative questions about the quality and persistence of democracy.This course is part of a cross-university collaboration. Faculty from across 40 universities teach from the same syllabus, with students contributing to a collaborative database on democratic erosion and writing for the Democratic Erosion blog. This course helps bridge the gap between the classroom and the public sphere and allows you to be part of a larger discussion about the quality of contemporary democracy."

The focus of this course is on the history and culture of the Stalin labor camps. Beginning with the violence inflicted by the young Bolshevik regime on the Russian people, we will examine the creation of a network of camps during the \u201cgreat terror\u201d of 1937-1938 and the economic, political, and cultural features of the camps, through such topics as work, food, camp administration and guards, the relationship between the \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d and the common criminals, the special plight of women, the hardening of conditions in the camps during and after World War II and the zenith of the GULAG in the early 1950s.

The most recent financial crisis has put into question many of the assertions on both sides of this debate, in ways that question the very basic assumptions analysts of the global economy have been making since the creation of the Bretton Woods system in the aftermath of World War II. In this course we investigate the impact of the economic boom of the last two decades, the current crisis, and their impact on the economic fate and standing of particularly the United States, India, China, and Russia. We focus in part on efforts to create a new financial architecture for the global economy, and investigate how the debate between markets and state intervention has been affected by the ongoing financial crisis-and what this may mean for both countries that rely extensively on markets, and for those that strategically promote state intervention."

As Italy left behind its predominantly agrarian past and entered full force into the global industrial economy, Italians rapidly made themselves modern: investing in new status symbols and consumer goods in the form of cars, TVs, and refrigerators, listening to new music, cultivating new pastimes and lifestyles, and even making more babies. Yet with modernization came contradictions. Optimism for the future was accompanied by a loss of traditional points of reference and community; economic expansion, by a widening of the gap between Northern and Southern Italy; mass exodus from rural areas to cities, by the creation of the no-mans lands of the urban borgate or shantytowns; and the proliferation of goods, by the perils of unbridled consumerism and existential crisis.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0In this course we will explore how the developments and radical shifts of these years were investigated and represented in literature, film, and music, by a remarkable group of writers, film directors, and including Pier Paolo Pasolini, Italo Calvino, Natalia Ginzburg, Alberto Moravia, Anna Maria Ortese, Dario Fo and Franca Rame, Federico Fellini, and others."

The unprecedented fusion Dante made of these elements in the Commedia [The Divine Comedy] has guaranteed his great poem a vast public, extending across world cultures and the seven centuries since it initially traveled among elite readers in north-central Italy in the early decades of the fourteenth century. This course will first examine the development of Dante\u2019s poetic voice in La vita nova [The New Life, ca. 1293-94] and then focus on its subsequent expansion into an all-encompassing vision of life and death in Inferno [Hell, ca. 1306-09], the first of the three canticles of the Commedia. Situating Dante in his own time and place will be essential to our analysis of his poetry, but attention to the multiple ways that Dante\u2019s work has been interpreted, translated, and appropriated in other periods, languages, and media will provide a critical framework for understanding its enduring appeal, why \u2013 in the words of Italo Calvino \u2013 it \u201chas not finished saying what it has to say.\u201d Readings, lectures, discussion, and written work \u2013 to include a mid-term exam, two short essays, and a final digital project \u2013 will be in English.

In this course we will examine the main events connected with the Second World War, the genocide of European Jewry and Roma-Sinti, forced resettlements of various populations, and the Allied attacks on the German civilian population.\u00a0 We will analyze the different stages of coming to grips with that past on the part of German and some other postwar societies, by examining together a number of controversies like those surrounding the Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Eichmann and Barbie trials, the campaign to build a Holocaust memorial in Berlin, Neonazism, the Wehrmacht photo exhibition, and the current campaign to remember German civilian casualties and losses.\u00a0 Approaching our topic with interdisciplinary and comparative methodology, that is, by utilizing history, journalism, video testimony, music, literature, and art, including film, photography and architecture, students will develop their own perspectives on the formation of postwar German identity and why Nazis remain the epitome of evil. An individual midterm project will allow students to practice the skill of summarizing different sides of a debate, and a final group project will invite students to solidify what they have learned in the course about the formation of national identity by creatively staging a contemporary debate about the Nazi past."

This question needs to be considered in the terms of literary, cultural, and media history. With regard to adventurers (both male and female), a highly interesting question to examine is whether they consciously expose themselves to danger in order to experience an adventure or whether the adventure is the inadvertent consequence of fate or accident. The character and significance of these questions changes as they approach the present, in which the pursuit of adventure is becoming ever more widespread and its documentation includes real-time transmission almost as a matter of course."

Our course Mobs, Crowds, and the People: Activism in Populist Times explores the longstanding history of popular unrest and mobilization, fear of the people in literature, philosophy, theology and film from across three continents. Populism is central to current debates about politics and the future of democracy, from radical right organizations in Europe to left-wing parties and presidents in Southern Europe and Latin America to the Occupy Wall Street Movement, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump and the \u201cCapitol Riot\u201d in the United States. But populism is also one of the most contested concepts in the humanities and political theory. Is populism an ideology or a revolutionary strategy? A style of politics? And, crucially, who are \u201cthe people\u201d in populism?"

But surprisingly, the most canonical thinkers in political theory have favored a different set of concepts: strife and civil war. For\u00a0Plato, Hobbes, Marx, Arendt, Freud, Lenin,\u00a0Schmitt, and many others, it is not the social contracts of government and laws that hold people\u00a0together, but\u00a0love\u00a0and\u00a0hate, the most intense passions of our closest human relationships.\u00a0Of course, these passions are highly unstable, which leads us to many of the most profound paradoxes of philosophy and art: Why are tragedies dangerous to public morale and yet indispensable for public education? What do we do when families are torn apart by unreconcilable beliefs? How can a foe be a better friend than your friends? Similarly, the idea of \u201cfraternity,\u201d so central for modern revolutions and the birth of the nation, is fraught with enmity and quarrel.\u00a0This course will pursue these problematics in key texts of philosophy, literature, and contemporary critical theory, and bring the philosophical paradigm of civil war to bear in relation to US and German culture."

We will situate each theme in its historical and literary context and investigate in what ways imagining sexual desires beyond the publicly acceptable may be read 1) as a call for non-conformism and rebellion against the repressive politics of the state exacted on the individual subject, 2) as a response against the psycho-medical field\u2019s narrow labeling of sexual desires as degenerate perversions of middle class morals, 3) as cautionary tales that aim to redress such perceived acts of deviance and reestablish the moral order of the majority and 3) as artistic expression of that which is fundamentally human, i.e. the wide range of human sensory perception between the self and the other, which leads to such desires.

The course will also trace the pervasive presence of noir and its continuing appeal for artists and audiences throughout the world.

When we use the term in the twenty-first century, we usually refer to computer-generated fantasy images of otherworldly creatures or impossible locales. However, the history of special visual effects begins with the basic technologies of photographically filmed moving pictures, and effects\u2014whether matte shots using optical printers in post-production, rear- or front-projection process shots done live on-set, in-camera mattes and mirror shots, or \u201ccreature\u201d effects controlled by wires, puppetry, robotics, or remotes\u2014have served many purposes besides generating fantasy worlds. Beginning in the 1890s, the magician and filmmaker Georges Melies used editing, photographic processes, elaborate puppets, and ornate costumes and sets to take viewers up to the moon or down to the bottom of the sea. Only two decades later, however, processes similar to those utilized by Melies were primarily employed to film realistic-looking settings at a fraction of the cost of location shooting. Today, scholars of special visual effects try to answer historical as well as technical questions about what has motivated the incredible innovations of \u201cFX,\u201d the forms they take, and the functions they perform for producers and viewers. What determines these different uses of special effects? How have these processes and practices developed in the US film industry and among independent creators? And how do the standards of realism and plausibility\u2014the standards by which special effects are traditionally judged\u2014change depending on the era, the technologies being employed, and the culture in and for which films are made? This course will place us in the thick of such contemporary scholarly debates about special effects and their history. By viewing key examples of special effects cinema from the past century (primarily from US films) and reading what historians have argued about the significance of these films, students will learn to write and think in these terms and to develop their own educated stances on the topic\u2014to participate as full partners in these scholarly debates. Students will also learn to consider such conditions as industrial history and cultural change as factors in the development of special effects as well as what these effects mean to their viewers."

        "course_description": "How may films serve as a starting point for revisiting the past and rethinking the present? In what ways may representations of the Middle East differ over time and across places? And why do the stories told by filmmakers in documentaries, historical dramas, and other cinematic productions matter? Movies depicting the Middle East routinely draw mass audiences and consequently shape popular perceptions of the region the world over. The very same films, however, are all too often understood by many people as mere entertainment. In this class, we will consider what movies, if treated critically, may teach us about Middle East history. Beginning with a brief introduction to film and media studies, we will contemplate where the Middle East fits into this field of inquiry. Once establishing how we will approach movies and the Middle East throughout the term, we will navigate a number of key themes together, from war, memory, and migration to (mis)information, revolution, and representation. Along the way, we will watch everything from indie films to big budget blockbusters. Regardless of the exact form these projects assume, all of the pictures we explore will generate debate and discussion around the past and present. Among the topics we will cover are the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, European colonialism, and America\u2019s legacy in the Arab\u00a0world. To assist us on this journey across the Middle East and well beyond its boundaries, we will engage several primary sources, with motion pictures at the forefront. These thought-provoking items will empower us to partake in conversations that traverse languages, national borders, historical eras, and artistic genres, enabling us to view the Middle East in an entirely new way."

The City of Light is arguably one of the most beautiful and exciting destinations in the world. However, all that glitters is not gold. Matters of race and anti-blackness co-exist with a variety of myths, narratives, and representations of Paris and France as color-blind and race-free. Through French film, students will explore these and related issues and thereby gain a broader understanding of pressing social questions, involving anti-racism, belonging, inequality, racism, and their intersections.

In our comparison of European and American films, we will explore similarities and differences in debates surrounding mobility, national identity, indigeneity, film-induced tourism, and human rights."

We will analyze the shifting and situational meanings of race and gender throughout the twentieth century, and in particular, how they have been influenced by the forces of history, including wars, economic depressions, and social movements. While we will focus our attention on Hollywood cinema of the \u201cgolden age\u201d, the period from the 1920s-1960, we will also spend significant time considering American independent cinema and the post-classical period of filmmaking from the 1960s to the present.

Of course, the question of race, and the racialization of the Jews, is often thought to be modern phenomenon when Race Science became prominent in the nineteenth century. But lately scholars have begun to re-think the category of race in connection with modernity and to reconsider race as a construct that extends back at least into the Middle Ages.This course will look at the long historical trajectory of Jews and race, beginning in the Middle Ages and focusing primarily on European modernity, America, including the complex alliance of Jews and Blacks from slavery to BLM, the role of race in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and the rise of Islamophobia. The goal of this course is to better understand the nature of Jews as a genos/race/ethos/people as they are labeled by others as well as how they self-identify. Jews identified as a \u201crace,\u201d and were identified as such by others, until the 1930s, after which ethnos served as a substitute. The question of \u201cwhiteness\u201d loomed large for Jews in America; are Jews white, and if so, what are the implications of their \u201cwhiteness\u201d? Finally, we will explore more recent iterations of this vexing issue in contemporary politics that includes \u201cJews of Color,\u201d Zionism, Israel/Palestine, conversion to Judaism, and progressive politics in America."

These writers constituted what Erika and Klaus Mann called \u201cThe Other Germany\u201d by carrying forward the avant-garde possibilities of Weimar culture and offering political resistance to the Nazi regime from outside of Germany. Yet they were also confronted with the challenges of exile, including homelessness, alienation, and the struggle to form communities, along with painful questions about their own German identity and their relationship to the German language.Examining works by Arendt, Mann, Brecht, Benjamin, Auerbach, Kracauer, Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, Seghers, Sachs, Celan, Adorno, Werfel, Zinnemann, Lorre, and Schoenberg, the course will address key topics raised by the German-Jewish experience of exile, including nostalgia, loss, antisemitism, the corruption of the German language by National Socialism, bilingualism, the political significance of the refugee experience and resistance to fascism, the complex image of America in the works of German-Jewish refugees, and the religious meanings of exile."

How did post-World War II politics produce the march to war? How was the war experienced by the various actors? Why was it such a euphoric victory for the Israelis and a shattering defeat for the Arabs? How has its legacy haunted the politics, history, and culture of the region in the decades since? This course will examine a wide variety of source material, including films, fiction, memoirs, and historical accounts, to seek to answer some of these questions.

We will interrogate such topics as: the real and imagined role of \u201cshopping\u201d women and gender in the shaping of modern downtowns; the relationship between the American suburb, new sexual identities and the film Pillow Talk; and how a particular nostalgia for the past that has led to the popularity of such shows as Mad Men can also be seen on the streets of Hanover (neo-traditional urbanism)."

We'll learn how to use archives; make creative use of documents and artifacts; engage with scholarly historical writing as a source for creative writing; and interrogate our assumptions about research and representation, all in the service of character-driven narratives as vivid, nuanced, and dramatic as writing based on contemporary fieldwork. This course is an attempt to raise the dead, to resurrect truths from dormant facts, to find stories of the present within the past. You'll write two short nonfiction stories, of a person and a place, based on secondary sources, and one long narrative based on original research.

Matthiessen coined the term \u201cAmerican Renaissance\u201d in his groundbreaking book, The American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman (1941). At the outset of the nineteenth century American writers struggled with a sense of cultural inferiority and artistic belatedness. The \u201cAmerican Renaissance\u201d demarcates a period as well as a cultural movement marked by intense literary activity between the 1830s and 1860s that aimed at the formation of a distinctively American literature. Matthiessen restricted the American Renaissance to the years between 1850 and 1855, an \u201cextraordinarily concentrated moment of literary expression\u201d (vii) that saw the publication of Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s The Scarlet Letter, House of the Seven Gables, and The Blithedale Romance; Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2019s Representative Men; Herman Melville\u2019s Moby-Dick; Henry David Thoreau\u2019s Walden; and Walt Whitman\u2019s Leaves of Grass. In the years since the publication of Matthiessen\u2019s important work, teachers and scholars in American literature have extended the American Renaissance\u2019s chronological provenance at least as far back as the anti-slavery debates in the 1830s and as far forward as the termination of the Civil War. In the past several decades, Matthiessen\u2019s argument has been challenged for its exaggeration of the originality of his coterie of male authors, for the exclusion of women and African-American and popular authors from his account of the United States during a period of remarkable social and cultural transformation, and for its seemingly uncritical acceptance of the doctrine of American exceptionalism. In light of these criticisms, scholars have added Emily Dickinson, Frederick Douglass, Margaret Fuller, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Mark Twain (among others) to Matthiessen\u2019s American Renaissance pantheon."

Beginning in 1836 with Charles Dickens\u2019 first novel, Victorian audiences often read texts as weekly and monthly \u2018parts\u2019 rather than as literary \u2018wholes\u2019. In 2007, Netflix introduced streaming, and in 2013, the company began producing original content. Instead of waiting a week for the next television episode, audiences could binge watch entire seasons (or more). Both the serial and digital streaming have been called revolutionary, but what does this mean? This course pairs Victorian serial novels and Netflix original series in order to think critically about structure and form. How does the play between serial part and whole necessitate new temporalities, strategies of characterization and narration, and types of suspense? How does binge-watching disrupt or reshape narrative time and sequencing? How have both new forms altered cultural discourses on gender, social consciousness, crime, and politics? How do narratives intersect with other types of seriality, including evolution, reproduction and inheritance, election cycles, and the #MeToo movement? This course emphasizes close reading and watching as well as narrative theory and reception and moves between nineteenth-century novels and twenty-first century series."

Some eras especially seem to embrace such narratives, such as the \u201cGilded Age\u201d which owes its name to Mark Twain. Yet the term itself was tongue-in-cheek, and many of the works produced in that \u201cage\u201d are as -- if not more -- concerned with rags than riches. Taking material possessions \u2013 or their absence \u2013 as a lens through which to examine economic and cultural conditions, these texts don\u2019t work from as much as they work towards a definition of what poverty is and what it does \u2013 to individual people and whole classes (with gender and race as salient categories). In this class, we will read key literary works, especially in the genres of Realism and Naturalism, alongside theoretical texts to shed new light on the way in which American Literature portrays, critiques, embraces as well as reimagines the material and cultural conditions of Americans\u2019 lives and livelihoods."

Informed by Black Studies approaches to literary representations, this course examines life writing, short stories, poems, and novels about mixed-race, interracial, and biracial subjects of the nineteenth century, a period of tumultuous change for those misnamed by the racializing logics of the time as mulatto/mulatta, metis, mestiza/mestizo, quadroon, or octoroon.

To answer these questions, we will engage with primarily contemporary Asian/American works of literature, poetry, film, performance, and art that alters, disrupts, and varies Asian/American narratives of migration, assimilation, and upward mobility.

What language have they crafted, historically, to describe such an expansive, radical project? For the purposes of this course, we will linger with a wide range of cinematic and literary moments with the aim of framing a much larger conversation about the uses of black art-making as a means through which we might access a critical vocabulary for black feeling; might assert the breaking into the world of a black love that is both resistance and that which exceeds it, love as a sort of black operation, black love as an act of marronage. Towards that end, this course will employ the films of contemporary writer and director Barry Jenkins, and place them in direct conversation with a larger constellation of writings within the African American literary tradition. Through our collective investigation of these texts, we will work together toward the elaboration of an aesthetics of black love."

The boundaries of community may also become extensive, resisting containment and refusing to conform to a common cultural identity.

Those eras may be characterized according to four broad rubrics or temporal themes as follows: 1) the Pan-African movement, pursued as a practice by black activists at the turn of the twentieth century and after the end of WWI; 2) the era of decolonization and the mounting of the Civil and human rights campaigns in the United States, the Caribbean, and independence movements on the Sub-Saharan African Continent, which events share the global context of the \u201cCold War\u201d (from the Marshall Plan to the collapse of the Berlin Wall, 1989, and the dismantling of the Soviet Union, 1991); 3) the birth of the Black Studies movement (alongside the resurgence of black nationalism) and the development of the new epistemologies of the post-\u2018sixties and beyond, and finally 4) the emergence of the concept of the African Diaspora and the post-race/post-colonial thematics of the late twentieth-early twenty-first century, marked by the presidency of Barack Obama. Each of these eras of human and social engagement has engendered its own distinctive work on the idea of black culture.

How does an audience\u2019s awareness of a literary precedent influence reception? What kinds of adaptations do we value and what role does their faithfulness to originals play? This course will look at twelve adaptations of major plays that most consider somewhat radical (e.g. Chicken Rice War; Omkara, Ran, Forbidden Planet, Scotland, P.A.) exploring the conceptual and cinematic strengths of the adaptations, as well as what their attempts to preserve or recast elements of Shakespeare\u2019s plays reveals about the energies of the originals. Each film should thus prove a site of discussion in its own right, as well as an interpretive text that both critiques and argues the merits of the source text. Students can expect to read seven plays and see at least two adaptations of each, writing short responses to each play and film on canvas. Course Group IV"

This course examines literary works, stand-up comedy, rom-coms and classic Hollywood comedy, and sit-com television (among other comedic forms) in order to consider the capacity for comedy to criticize the status quo and effect social change. It also investigates theoretical approaches to comedy and laughter, such as Sigmund Freud\u2019s psychoanalytic interpretation of jokes and Henri Bergson\u2019s philosophy of laughter, which ask why we laugh in the first place. Literary works and films may include Shakespeare\u2019s Twelfth Night, Samuel Beckett\u2019s Waiting For Godot, Charlie Chaplin\u2019s Modern Times, and Judd Apatow and Amy Schumer\u2019s Trainwreck. We will also discuss stand-up performances by the likes of Aziz Ansari, Louis C.

Because psychoanalysis is also a clinical practice, this interdisciplinary encounter raises the question of the practical dimension of philosophical thought, and we will ask about philosophy\u2019s potential impact on lived experience, as well as whether the practice of psychoanalysis remains a valuable mode of treatment or an aid to everyday living. To help organize the broad questions at the intersections of psychoanalysis and philosophy, we will divide the class loosely into four thematic units, the unconscious, Oedipus, interpretation, and transference.

But surprisingly, the most canonical thinkers in political theory have favored a different set of concepts: strife and civil war. For\u00a0Plato, Hobbes, Marx, Arendt, Freud, Lenin,\u00a0Schmitt, and many others, it is not the social contracts of government and laws that hold people\u00a0together, but\u00a0love\u00a0and\u00a0hate, the most intense passions of our closest human relationships.\u00a0Of course, these passions are highly unstable, which leads us to many of the most profound paradoxes of philosophy and art: Why are tragedies dangerous to public morale and yet indispensable for public education? What do we do when families are torn apart by unreconcilable beliefs? How can a foe be a better friend than your friends? Similarly, the idea of \u201cfraternity,\u201d so central for modern revolutions and the birth of the nation, is fraught with enmity and quarrel.\u00a0This course will pursue these problematics in key texts of philosophy, literature, and contemporary critical theory, and bring the philosophical paradigm of civil war to bear in relation to US and German culture."

The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the missions and capabilities of military forces, and to teach them how to estimate the likely costs, risks, and outcomes of military operations. This course will use theoretical works and historical cases to familiarize students with some of the principles of air, ground, and naval operations. Students will use the tools which they learn in class to conduct a detailed military analysis that bears on an important current foreign policy question. No prior knowledge of military forces is needed for this class. Prerequisite: Government 5 or permission of the instructor. The instructor encourages seniors, juniors, as well as sophomores with strong writing and research skills, to enroll in this seminar.\r"

How should we understand the dynamics of insurgency and counterinsurgency in countries under foreign occupation? Finally, what are the long-term consequences of resistance and collaboration, and how are these phenomena remembered in countries that once suffered under occupation? In interrogating these questions, the course will draw on a wide range of historical cases, including Nazi, Soviet, and Japanese occupations during World War II, post-war U.S. occupations of Germany and Japan, and recent American occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq."

We will examine the ways in which statutes lay down general rules of law, which are leave ambiguities and uncertainties to be interpreted in court opinions. We will look at differences in how crimes are defined and punished across state systems, and discuss tensions created by the law and its underlying justifications. We will work on developing sound arguments from competing perspectives around an issue.We will also focus on skills of practical application. Reading court cases, identifying the key facts \u00a0and then summarizing them in a useful way can be difficult and a time-consuming skill to learn, but will be valuable regardless of what profession you ultimately choose to pursue. Analyzing legal cases and participating in discussion will require you to pay careful attention to a wide range of facts, carefully consider alternatives, and thoughtfully express your perspectives. Finally, we will begin the process of learning how attorneys analyze, differentiate, and argue cases based on the needs of their clients."

This course will explore the complex issues related to identity and democracy in the Baltics through two four-week modules, one based at Vilnius University in Lithuania, and the other at the University of Tartu in Estonia.The courses will focus on two themes. One is how Baltic identity has been influenced by the region's experiences as part of the Soviet Union, its current proximity to Russia, and its many ties to Europe. You will explore the impact of the Soviet era on the cultural and political identity of the Baltics, and how this history continues to shape contemporary issues related to national identity, language, and political participation. You will also analyze the current geopolitical climate and how the region's unique position between East and West impacts its identity and its democratic development.Another theme is related to ethnic and gender discrimination in the Baltics. You will explore the challenges that women and minority groups face in the region, and the progress that has been made towards greater equality and inclusion. You will also consider the intersection of identity and discrimination, and how these issues can impact the development of a cohesive and democratic society.Throughout the course, you will also examine how the emergent Baltic identity and identity-related issues present both possibilities and challenges to democratic consolidation in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and in other countries throughout the region. By the end of the course, you will have a deep understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities facing the Baltics and how these issues impact the broader region."

While we will focus our attention on Hollywood cinema of the \u201cgolden age\u201d, the period from the 1920s-1960, we will also spend significant time considering American independent cinema and the post-classical period of filmmaking from the 1960s to the present.

Finally, the course draws on these historical and anthropological understandings to assess recent economic, social, and political developments in Latin America.

From the 1920s and 30s, when an emphasis was placed on Mexico\u2019s rural and indigenous populations to the 1940s and 50s, when greater attention was given to Mexican modernization, through the years after 1968, when artists and intellectuals endeavored to reveal the repressive nature of Mexicanidad and its role in propagandizing an authoritarian state and ruling party, to the 1990s when any consensus about the nation dissolved under the pressures of neoliberalism, state and narco-violence, free trade and labor migrations, and the rise of new social movements from Zapatismo, queer, feminist, and environmental activism. In this course we will place artists like Jose Clemente Orozco and Frida Kahlo within a broader visual cultural context that includes not only mural art and painting, but also sculpture, architecture, printmaking, photography, installation, film, and performance. We will cover art produced in Mexico and \u201cGreater Mexico\u201d from the turn of the 20th century through the \u201cboom\u201d years of the 1990s, with a focus on issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality throughout.

Some themes we will consider are: modernization and class politics, Indigenism and racialization/racism, development/underdevelopment, authoritarianism and state-violence, diaspora and migration, transnationalism and the politics of museum exhibitions, contemporary human rights and social justice movements.

Whether these threats are real or not, they speak to the very different ways we imagined ideal Latinx futurity. This cultural studies course closely examines these fights, tensions, and disagreements in order to better understand Latinx futurity.

How does Latinx high fantasy re-imagine the colonial encounter and resistance to it? How does Latinx low fantasy employ artifacts, mythologies, and folklore to revisit and reframe the stories that shape identity?

We will begin by examining revolutionary nationalist and anti-imperialist culture in the Americas\u2014ranging from the memoirs of Che Guevara and Malcolm X to Nuyorican and Chicano Movement literature\u2014in order to consider the formation of revolutionary subjects, and how 20th century ideas of revolution were raced and gendered. We will then consider how novelists, artists, photographers, filmmakers, and activists attempted to imagine solidarity with revolutionary movements and suffering others in the Americas, from Central America solidarity photography to performance art in solidarity with Guantanamo Bay prisoners. We will pay special attention to the work of feminist and queer solidarity artists, writers, and performers. Finally, we will examine contemporary activist cultural projects, such as PanAmerican public art road trips and hashtag-activism.

To understand the island\u2019s history, students are expected to read what historians and writers have written about Haiti; and to read the primary letters of frantic French planters, rebellious African slaves, egalitarian peasants, entrepreneurial market women, conscientious revolutionaries, exuberant military generals, loquacious politicians, feared dictators, and dreaded militias through time. The course will, indeed, move through four important, though overlapping, historical moments. First, we begin with an examination of the 1791-1804 Haitian Revolution when enslaved Africans revolted against the French colonial planters to successfully abolish slavery and to achieve national independence. Second, we read through the formation of grassroots and institutional democratic traditions in the nineteenth century and how they were undone during the 1915-1934 US Occupation of Haiti, where US President Woodrow Wilson ordered the American military to invade Haiti and control the island for almost two decades. Third, we will explore how the undoing of democracy led to the rise of the Francois and Jean-Claude Duvalier dictatorship (1957-1971) and its dreaded militia called the tonton makout militia (often spelled in the following French orthography: tonton macoutes). Finally, we will conclude the class by looking at how and why the Haitian peasantry overthrew the dictatorship to replace it with the democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide (1991)."

The authoritarian regimes installed in Brazil (1964-85), Uruguay (1973-85), Chile (1973-90) and Argentina (1976-83) caused deep ruptures in collective and individual lives and still resonate in the South American political, social and cultural landscapes. After the democratic systems were reestablished in the region, new facts about the abuse of power by the militaries were disclosed, and a heated debate took place in the public sphere about how to deal with the past. Feature films, documentaries, and fiction and non-fiction literature played an essential role in that debate by providing different strategies of healing scars, honoring victims and survivors, and preserving the memory of both the terror and the grassroots resistance. The experiences and memories of the so-called \"dirty war\" in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay generated not only several fictional renderings of state terrorism during the \"years of lead,\" but also a whole series of testimonios by those directly affected by it, such as the daughters, sons and spouses of desaparecidos who were assassinated by the machinery of state repression.This class focuses on the legacies of dictatorships in South America and the politics and aesthetics of representation of state violence and political resistance. Students will be introduced to central concepts of memory and trauma studies and will conduct comparative literary and cinematic analyses of works by Latin American writers and film directors."

We will listen to audiocassette sermons in Egypt, jazz in Istanbul, and the din of warfare in Iraq, among many other acoustic items, to gain a greater appreciation for the centrality of sound in people\u2019s everyday lives and its significance in the domain of Middle Eastern studies."

In this course, we will examine the politics of Iraq under the British mandate, as an independent state under the monarchy, and as a republic after the coup of 1958. We will also examine the rule of the Baath and of Saddam Hussein as well as the American invasion of Iraq and its aftermath.\u00a0Drawing on a mixture of texts and media, the course explores the prevalent tropes of Iraqi culture, the ideologies underpinning these tropes and in doing so provides a cultural context for understanding the forces that shaped the modern history of that country."

From Mohamad Ali&rsquo;s modernization program in the 19th century to the recent chanting for freedom in Tahrir Square, Egypt&rsquo;s different social forces, state, and international partners have been shaping its modernity in different&mdash;sometimes contradictory&mdash;ways. This struggle transformed the political, economic, social and cultural landscape of the country, and continues to be the focal point of its unfolding drama. The spread of modern ideologies (nationalism, liberalism, socialism), the construction of Islamism, the reordering of social hierarchies and family structure, the transformation of norms and values, among other issues, are better understood when read as part of this long, twisted, and tormented march of modernity."

It analyzes the transformative impact of the discovery of Oil, the establishment of the state of Israel, the Cold War, Turkey\u2019s integration into NATO and the US attempts to establish a security regime for the Middle East. It also examines how Americans viewed the Middle East and their role in its life. In addition, the course then takes the students in a tour d\u2019horizon of US role in Middle East politics: its involvement in the Arab-Israeli Peace Process, its responses to Radical Islamism and 9/11, the invasion of Iraq and its consequences, the uneasy relationship with a changing Turkey, and its policy of \u201cdemocracy promotion\u201d.

French political philosopher \u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie (1530\u20131563) in his seminal essay Discours de la servitude volontaire (Discourse on Voluntary Servitude) presented the existence of a dictatorship as a relationship between two parties. Before every dictator is a population that is willing to accept rule by the dictator. The dictator cannot impose his will on a people that shun a dictatorship. Extrapolating from this concept, we can consider dictatorship to be a syndrome. The dictionary defines a syndrome as \u201ca group of signs and symptoms that occur together and characterize a particular abnormality or condition.\u201d In this course, students will examine the condition, signs, symptoms, and cures for the malady of dictatorship."

In this class, we will consider what movies, if treated critically, may teach us about Middle East history. Beginning with a brief introduction to film and media studies, we will contemplate where the Middle East fits into this field of inquiry. Once establishing how we will approach movies and the Middle East throughout the term, we will navigate a number of key themes together, from war, memory, and migration to (mis)information, revolution, and representation. Along the way, we will watch everything from indie films to big budget blockbusters. Regardless of the exact form these projects assume, all of the pictures we explore will generate debate and discussion around the past and present.

The eclectic materials taken into consideration here come from widely diverse \u2013 but nevertheless interconnected \u2013 linguistic and cultural ecologies, and they move across a long temporal arc. Through their encounter with these resources, students will come to understand the Mediterranean as a space that can be defined beyond established geo-political barriers as a world that has been constructed through historical contingencies and in imaginative \u2013 sometimes contentious, often kinetic \u2013 engagement with them."

Despite their internal and mutual conflicts, the two groups share similar experiences of hostility when trying to integrate into American society with fierce antisemitism and Islamophobia against the backdrop of increasing right-wing ethno-nationalism. Concomitantly, both groups share deep ambivalences about assimilating to American culture vs. retaining discrete cultural identities. If Jews and Arabs play decisive roles in US politics, both as effective actors and as imagined targets of opposition, the United States in turn acted not only as mediator in the international relationship between the two groups; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, post-9/11 politics, anti-terrorist actions, or the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban on five Muslim-dominated countries have also influenced the relationship between Jewish and Arab communities within the United States. Instead of equating the experiences of Jews and Arabs viz-a-viz America, this course examines the multifaceted encounters in what has to be considered a complex Jewish-Arab-American triangular. The ways in which Jews and Arabs interact in the US, will be as central to the course as examples of hybrid cultural experiences of Arab Jews and artefacts such as the numerous American synagogues built in the style of Moorish architecture. We will examine cultural representations of Jews and Arabs in American literature, movies, documentaries, memoirs, art, popular culture and political analyses with attention to aspects of class, race and gender.

This course has no prerequisites but familiarity with the history of the Middle East in the twentieth century and trends in contemporary Arabic prose during this period would be helpful."

Written over more than half a century, these novels present different\u2014sometimes contradictory\u2014perspectives on the \u201cWest.\u201d Some of these novels are focused primarily on East-West relations while others represent the West in the context of large-scale sociocultural transformations in the Middle East and broader global political dynamics. To anchor our discussion of the topic and to broaden our knowledge of the ways Arabic literature has depicted the \u201cWest,\u201d we will also read a variety of critical texts that explore the image of the West in the Arab world."

Students will read a variety of primary and secondary materials designed to familiarize them with the historical, cultural, and social processes that have affected and transformed the region in question, and will learn to put these regional histories in a global framework. The course begins with a brief summary of the early modern Islamicate \u201cGunpowder\u201d Empires\u2014Mughal, Safavid/Qajar, Ottoman\u2014and then moves through several topics of significance: the era of European colonialism; the establishment of the nation state; competing discourses of nationalism; the emergence of Third Worldist and anti-colonial movements; the Israeli- Palestinian conflict; debates over the politics of gender; the effects of the Cold War; the processes of decolonization and the establishment of post-colonial states; the rise of revolutionary Islamism; oil politics and policies; globalization and neoliberalism; 9/11, terrorism, and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; the Arab uprisings of 2010-2011; and the region\u2019s uncertain present and future."

Were their motives economic, religious, or political? Were they responding primarily to events in Europe, or were colonists and officials merely adapting pragmatically to the new environments and people they encountered? Crucially, we will also consider the imposition of empire from the perspectives of the ordinary people who negotiated it on the ground \u2013 Native Americans, European colonists, sailors, merchants, and the enslaved. How did they exploit or reject the grander schemes of their aspiring rulers?

Even before the advent of COVID-19, infectious disease was the number one cause of death in the world. In the last several years, we have all experienced just how epidemics and pandemics are a force in society, religion, politics, the economy, and culture. This course takes as its premise that epidemics and plagues are one of the central forces of human history. With a focus on the Western narrative, but with gestures to global contexts and comparisons, this course will examine the role of plague in shaping cultural, intellectual, religious, political, and public-health history, from biblical times to the present. The outbreak of bubonic plague (\u201cthe Black Death\u201d) in the fourteenth century will provide a central anchor to the issues, with comparisons to the Justinianic plague (6th century), tuberculosis, yellow fever, the Spanish-flu, HIV-AIDS (etc.), and of course, COVID-19. In this course, we will read accounts of history (Thucydides on plague in 5th century BC Athens; Daniel Defoe on 1655), accounts of literature (Boccaccio, Decameron, Susan Sontag on the language of AIDS), and modern scholarship written in the wake of our own plague experience as part of our effort to understand the human reaction and interpretation to plague."

At the same time, the course considers the importance of the sea in bringing British subjects into closer contact with a wide variety of environments and peoples whose influences transformed British attitudes, aspirations, and practices at home and abroad. The course also explores how a dynamic relationship with the sea itself, as experienced by ordinary people of Britain and its global contacts, shaped how these people viewed themselves, their history, their surroundings, and the wider world."

From the Chicago blues to the Bakersfield Sound; The Grapes of Wrath to Black Boy; the Black Panthers to the Southern Baptist Convention\u2014the influence of the southern migrations can be seen everywhere in American society during these years. Rather than treating the experiences of black and white migrants separately, this course takes a comparative approach to these simultaneous and parallel migrations, focusing on the political and economic factors that drove out-migration from the South; the impact that southern migration had on race relations and labor markets in northern and western cities; the diasporic communities formed by southern migrants in their new homes; and the impact of the migrations on American culture and politics over the course of the 20th century."

In part three, we will consider democracies outside Athens, as well as non-democratic regime types, such as oligarchy, tyranny, and the \u201cLycurgan\u201d constitution at Sparta. In part four, we will turn our attention to the modern era. More specifically, we will compare Greek democracies to subsequent institutions that have been described as democratic (e.g., New England town hall meetings, the United States of America, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo); examine the impact of Greek democracy on the development of modern political thought."

The purpose of this course is to help you come to terms with today\u2019s political crisis by looking at challenges to liberalism\u2014as an idea, sensibility and political program\u2014from the Cold War until the present. Topics to be discussed include: Cold War Liberalism, Neoliberalism, the liberalism of John Rawls and his critics, Neoconservatism, Globalization, Liberalism and Religion, and the contemporary crisis of liberalism."

Students will analyze and discuss spatial history and place-based history projects from around the globe while also evaluating primary historical sources on local and regional history. Second, a fieldwork component will allow students to visit local archives and the places they are studying and examine the way history has alternatively been inscribed in or erased from the landscape.

We examine how and why a powerful and expansive British Empire emerged and sustained itself. Equally, we zoom in on the regular contestation and even outright rebellion that this transcontinental polity inspired. This course is an opportunity to think connectively and comparatively about historical experiences in America, India, the Caribbean and Africa among multiple other British imperial spaces. Through the prism of a changing British Empire, we trace the rise and evolution of global trade, slavery, the consumption of commodities such as sugar, tea, opium, and cotton; and new ideas about governance, sovereignty, race and identity. We conclude with a discussion of the persistence of imperial institutions, laws and power relations in shaping the world we inhabit. Students will be introduced to major debates about imperialism and colonialism and the political, economic, environmental, legal and racial underpinnings of the British Empire. Students will read a combination of primary and secondary sources every week and will develop a research paper drawn from original sources over the course of the term."

        "course_description": "This course explores one of the most radical experiments of the European Middle Ages: the military crusading orders. The members of these organizations were imagined to constitute a \"new knighthood\" of monkish warriors, theoretically living according to a strict monastic rule and dedicated to the protection and expansion of Christian society as the military branch of the church. These institutions\u2013and the Middle Ages more broadly\u2013have resurfaced as one contested site in a raging culture war over race, power, and identity in the United States and abroad. This course takes this recent trend as a prompt for placing the military orders within their medieval context, beginning with their emergence from a longer history of Judeo-Christian holy war. More broadly, we will also take the military orders as a case study for historical questions about the intersection of religious belief, group identity, and acts of violence in human societies. Given the place of the military orders in the modern imagination, from conspiracy theories to far-right ideologies, a central goal of this course is to equip students with the skills to evaluate historical sources first-hand and also to engage critically with a wide range of historical arguments."

To understand the island\u2019s history, students are expected to read what historians and writers have written about Haiti; and to read the primary letters of frantic French planters, rebellious African slaves, egalitarian peasants, entrepreneurial market women, conscientious revolutionaries, exuberant military generals, loquacious politicians, feared dictators, and dreaded militias through time. The course will, indeed, move through four important, though overlapping, historical moments. First, we begin with an examination of the 1791-1804 Haitian Revolution when enslaved Africans revolted against the French colonial planters to successfully abolish slavery and to achieve national independence. Second, we read through the formation of grassroots and institutional democratic traditions in the nineteenth century and how they were undone during the 1915-1934 US Occupation of Haiti, where US President Woodrow Wilson ordered the American military to invade Haiti and control the island for almost two decades. Third, we will explore how the undoing of democracy led to the rise of the Francois and Jean-Claude Duvalier dictatorship (1957-1971) and its dreaded militia called the tonton makout militia (often spelled in the following French orthography: tonton macoutes). Finally, we will conclude the class by looking at how and why the Haitian peasantry overthrew the dictatorship to replace it with the democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide (1991)."

Can there be a universal standard for human rights despite social difference? What political and ethical possibilities have been opened for marginalized communities by the language of human rights, and what possibilities have been foreclosed by the often-singular focus on human rights as a panacea against all social ills?

Viewing Native America as an incredibly complex series of borderlands is a useful interpretive model for better understanding the history of Native peoples. Lectures, readings, and class discussion will focus on elements such as cultural contact, conquest and colonialism, missionization, citizenship, gender, and nation. While exploring these various themes, we will touch on some familiar territory such as frontiers and middle grounds, but we will also question our own personal, and often, region-based expertise in order to unpack a more nuanced view of Indigenous borderlands and their significance."

This course engages various texts that feature Bear imagery in traditional stories, songs, and ritual representations-all vehicles that transmit both sacred and practical knowledge. We use readings in mythopoetics, performance narratives, nature writing, some early ethnographic accounts and recordings, environmental literature, and the contemporary writing of several Native American authors. Discussion about the tribal significance of the Bear is a means to examine ontological distinctions between human self and animal being, and the constructions of human consciousness within the natural world. We also discuss how concepts of \"wildness\" and \"wilderness,\" and ideas about \"control\" and \"freedom\" are expressed within imaginative and geographical spaces."

At the same time, these developments challenge the long-standing hegemony of the nation-state, particularly the centrality of the state's legal system and the presumption that the state is the sole author and arbiter of law. \u00a0The resurgence of Indigenous law and legal systems, in short, tests the limits of legal pluralism, the notion that two or more legal systems can co-exist peacefully in shared territories."

We will follow a historical approach, reading as many original sources as possible and focusing on three central themes: 1. The nature of the cosmos: from a closed cosmos to an expanding universe and the multiverse; 2. The nature of matter: from alchemy to quarks and quantum physics; 3. The nature of mind: Godel's incompleteness theorem, mathematics, computers, and the problem of consciousness. The main text will be The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning, by Marcelo Gleiser (Basic Books, Spring 2014). This will be complemented by original and critical texts by Plato, Aristotle, Galileo, Newton, Einstein, John Bell, David Bohm, Rebecca Goldstein, Thomas Nagel, Colin McGinn, and others.

If we don\u2019t have free will, can we be held morally responsible for our actions? Finally, we all think of ourselves not just as physical beings, but as thinking things\u2014as beings who are aware of our world, who have beliefs, thoughts, and hopes. But what is the mind\u2014and what are beliefs, thoughts, hopes? Can the mind be understood as identical with the brain, or mental events as events in the brain? If not, how can talk about the mental be understood? We will examine a variety of approaches to these three central topics through both historical and contemporary philosophical texts."

What justifies us in applying this concept? Are there larger and smaller levels of infinity? How many? Moreover, how are we to deal with the paradoxes that arise from the concept? The infinite also has a related, but arguably distinct use in certain philosophical debates where it is used to denote ideas of perfection or completeness, e.g. of the divine or human reason.

This course will engage such questions from a fundamentally interdisciplinary perspective, engaging with work from philosophy, cognitive science, linguistics, and psychology.

Through a survey of recent research at the intersection of Latin literature and the digital humanities, this course will introduce you to the state of the art in quantitative literary criticism. To ground our methodological investigations, we will explore a diverse selection of Latin poetry, including epic (Vergil, Lucan, and Catullus), elegy (Catullus), and comedy (Plautus), and sample some less famous later authors, such as Paul the Deacon and Vitalis of Blois, who were influenced by classical antecedents. At each turn, we will examine the interplay between traditional (close reading, philology, theory) and data-driven analyses of Latin literature and consider how quantitative methods can support humanistic inquiry. Along the way, you will gain hands-on experience with powerful computational tools and be introduced to now ubiquitous critical approaches, such as intertextuality and reception studies.

One of the key highlights of WGSS engagements with computing history is the focus on the politics and impacts of data-driven processes and big data on human lives. The course will provide a brief introduction to histories of computing and data-driven practices within the Anglo-American tradition, including discussions of the roles that ethics and biopolitics play within these histories. We will explore ways that privacy/security, algorithmic processes, computational environmental impacts, and design have exploited the most vulnerable while increasing affordances for the most privileged. We will also spend significant time learning about new data/computational justice initiatives and develop a robust understanding of how social justice issues like prison abolition, climate change, and equitable health outcomes are at the core of understanding computational cultures. No Computer Science or Data Science background is required, but the course will entail learning about some of the technical history within both fields. Similarly, there are no WGSS prerequisites for the cours but students will be responsibly for learning about anti-racist feminist and queer methods and insights."

And how can these methods be combined with existing ways of reading to illuminate how language works, what we can do with language, and what language does to us? In this course, we will apply insights from cultural studies and comparative literature to investigate how history, language, and culture shape our digital practices. We will develop a comparative and cultural critical perspective on digitization and text analysis practices as we learn about and contrast different methods of analyzing modern languages and literatures.

You likely have learned how to answer questions like these with standard OLS (linear) regression techniques and cross-sectional data, which remain useful tools in social scientists\u2019 methodological toolbox. But these techniques are also quite limited, and impose strict assumptions that do not allow us to meet many of our goals, adequately answer our questions, or provide stringent tests of our theories and hypotheses.In this course, we\u2019ll pick up where introductory statistics courses leave off, and get an introduction to more advanced statistical methods for observational data, including but not limited to: regression for categorical dependent variables, fixed and random effects models, and hierarchical linear modeling. This course will be a mix of seminar and lecture, where we will be focused on understanding how we can use these methods to better meet our goals and answer our research questions. Put differently, this course is less focused on going \u201cunder the hood\u201d and more focused on \u201chow to drive\u201d\u2014specifically, we will interrogate the assumptions and use of these statistical methods in the social sciences and learn how to implement these methods using STATA. This will include: discussion of core methodological assumptions and limitations, how to apply these statistical methods in different settings, and learning when specific methods are appropriate tools and when they are not. We will explore these issues through student-led discussions, hands-on data analysis, and dissecting the application of these methods in academic journal articles. As part of this course, you will be exposed to (and critique) a wide range of sociological research published in our major disciplinary journals.

Inequality and poverty have been rising. People have become polarized over racial, religious and social issues. Some say the politics of identity and self-interest have been unleashed at the expense of the nation\u2019s general welfare. Some disagree. This course explores these issues. It examines how political, economic and ideological power has been mobilized recently in the United States and with what consequences, including the conservative shift in American politics, the 2008 financial crisis, the election of Donald Trump, and possibly the decline of the United States as the world\u2019s superpower.

Religion is understood to direct the individual to the contemplation of the divine and provide a moral code; sex and sexuality is often perceived as too human and too tied to pleasure to have anything to do with the divine. But if we examine the relationship between sexuality and religion, we find that the two are inextricably intertwined. Indeed, the understanding of humans as sexed beings (that is, with differing sexual identities and as beings who engage in sex) is often grounded in religious texts, practices, and ideologies. Yet that religious grounding, while seemingly so solid, proves surprisingly flexible in practice. We will examine comparatively the ways in which religious stories, beliefs, and practices have shaped across several traditions. In addition to studying the normative ways that religions constructed sex and sexuality, we also examine how communities and individuals have re-interpreted, re-shaped, and refused the boundaries of normative religion."

In this course, we will interrogate this portrayal through a rigorous textual and conceptual study, using both primary Sufi texts and secondary sources. The course will first trace the development of Sufism, including its shared heritage in the religious traditions of the ancient Near East and India. Then, with a primary focus on the medieval Islamic world, the course engages multiple aspects of Sufism including its institutional and intellectual history, metaphysics, meditation and disciplinary practices, poetry and literature, the limits of normative Sufism, and orientalist and neo-imperialist representations of Sufism. Finally, using recent works from the fields of anthropology and sociology, the class will consider the role of Sufism in the Arab Spring.Not open to students who have received credit for REL 25"

The course also touches upon Eastern/Central European film, including the Czech New Wave (surrealist animator Jan Svankmeyer) and the \"post-Yugoslavian wave\" (Emir Kusturica and Dusan Makoveev). In addition to regular weekly screenings, all films will be made available online in an experimental format: divided into separate short clips that will be used in class for in-depth analysis and close cinematic readings. The final project (done in groups) will be creative: you will make a video-parody or video-stylization of one of the studied films. Open to all classes."

Chaadaev proclaimed that Russia had been cut off from the global community, belonged to no cultural system, and contributed nothing to the progress of the human spirit.\u00a0Since then, Russian writers and thinkers have wrestled with Chaadaev\u2019s categorical verdict. One response from the 20th century poet Osip Mandelstam pointed out that Chaadaev had overlooked one singular contribution: the Russian language. \u201cSuch a highly organized, such an organic language is not merely a door into history, it is history itself.\u201d Taking Mandelstam\u2019s point to its logical conclusion, it is Russia\u2019s literature that becomes the Rosetta stone to the exceptional nature of the Russian experience. In this course, we will explore some of the texts that make up this Rosetta stone.\u00a0While reading some of the most celebrated works from 19th century Russian fiction \u2013 texts by Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Turgenev, Goncharov, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov \u2013 we will attempt to account for the distinct character of Russian literature and its unique role in Russian history and culture."

Ultimately we will approach conspiracy theories as ways of knowing, of penetrating and ordering complex and opaque realities. They are also powerful narrative weapons that imperil the shared truths on which cohesive societies are based.

When our emotions go badly awry, we suffer debilitating mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Although emotions play a central role in our lives, studying them scientifically presents profound challenges. They seem intuitively hidden, elusive, messy, and hard to evoke or quantify in a laboratory. Despite these challenges, researchers have developed a thriving science of our emotional lives, which you will learn about in this course. We will begin by considering the origins of emotion, both biological and cultural. Subsequently we will examine how emotions manifest themselves in our bodies and brains, change dynamically over time, shape our social interactions, influence our cognition, and affect our mental health.

Decisions are easy to make if information is complete and the outcomes are certain. But how does the brain combine different sources of partial information to make decisions in the face of uncertain outcomes?\u00a0 In this course we will examine decision making from both behavioral and neurobiological points of view.

In the past four million years, an evolutionary blink of the eye, primates rapidly evolved brains that are several times larger than previously would have been predicted for their body size. How did this occur? What are the effects of these substantial brain changes? What are the contents of human brains, and how do they differ from the brains of other primates (and other mammals, and non-mammals)? Evolution acts on genes, not on organisms; what are the genetic factors that have been identified in recent primate brain growth? What relationships may obtain between anatomical and functional brain characteristics? What mechanisms are at play, including extrinsic factors and evolutionary \u201cpressures\u201d? What differential predictions do various theories make, and how are they tested? How would we know if a hypothesis is false; how do we know if they are falsifiable? The class will critically examine a set of related topics including brain structure, anthropology, evolution, genetics, development, cognition, race, intelligence."

        "course_description": "The capacities that set humans apart in kind, not just in degree, from all other known animals include, in part, capacities and propensities for art, music, analogical reasoning, abstract thought, creativity, the spontaneous generation and use of symbols, the ability to reason abstractly about others and about events, as well as the ability to manipulate symbols recursively and syntactically. This course will explore the hypothesis that all these modes of human behavior and cognition share a common root cause in our brains. We will focus in particular on the human capacity to imagine. We can, for example, construct a representation of a thing, say an airplane, or an event, say a planned party, and then go about making real that which we imagined. How is this capacity to imagine and creatively plan realized in the brain? Where did it first appear in the human lineage? What is the relationship of imagining to other important capacities, such as attention, volition, consciousness, planning and executive control? The goal of this course is to try to answer such questions by reading empirical and theoretical papers and chapters that try to account for what it is that makes the human mind human, by looking at distinctive aspects of processing in the human brain."

We will examine what is known about the neural bases of the different types of attention, with a particular focus on 'endogenous attention,' which is the mode of attending that is under volitional control. We will at the same time examine what is known about the neural bases of visual consciousness, with a particular focus on those aspects of neural processing that are modulated by volitionally attending to a stimulus or not.

First, institutional and informal religious enclaves successfully (try to) resist material and symbolic processes of modernization, that its, capitalism, democracy, and scientific thinking. Second, the process of secularization of public and private life gradually but irreversibly changes traditional ways of conceiving the nation, its past and cultural manifestations. Third, it could be argued that the \u201csubstance\u201d of religion does not disappear but evolves and mutates, secretly sacralizing new sphere of social coexistence. These profane and civil \u201creligions\u201d (religions without a proper God) trigger new beliefs, rites, and moral codes that, quite often, present themselves as totally rationalized and mundane. From a critical, politico-theological perspective, we can instead perceive their many metaphysical blind spots. In this course, students will be exposed to a series of literary and filmic texts in which these three forms of interconnexion between religion and political are easy to retrace. The goal of Modern Saints is to investigate how, in modern Spain (like so many other countries), modernity reinscribes many ingredients of spiritual transcendence in secular contexts, figures and practices. Well pay close attention to these new and disavowed forms of \u201csainthood\u201d in which politics gain a lot of theoretical and practical traction."

His early work showed the influence of the Enlightenment and had a critical point of view that aimed to not only please but also educate his viewers. As time went by, the ravages of illness, war, and political repression showed in his paintings through impactful and enigmatic imagery that upended the traditional role of an artist and that has earned him a relevant place in contemporary Spanish culture, as shown in his numerous films that bring him alive. Although he became a court painter and was well connected to the monarchy, a closer look to his paintings reveals a critical stance that urges his viewers to reflect on the lack of meaning in modern society. From the royal tapestries and portraits, to the incisive Caprichos, the impactful Disasters of the War and the desperate Black Paintings, we will examine the history of Spain through Goya's major works, not only as subject but also as object of representation in literature and in films."

Taking as point of departure both the comic and the romantic interpretations, the course will explore the meaning of the Quijote across the centuries. Its aim will be to understand the Quijote both as an autonomous work of literature and as a highly creative response to the literary and cultural forces from which it was forged. In addition to the historical context and social conflicts in the Hapsburg monarchy, the course will focus on the literary history and the novel as a literary genre and a product of the Medieval \u201cmixtification\u201d which flourished in the Renaissance."

Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s novel opens up a magical world where the boundaries that separate fantasy and reality, fairy tale and history seem to dissolve naturally. And yet, no fictional work has ever been more deeply grounded in the reality and history of a people. The book tells the incredible story of the Buend\u00eda family as it develops through the successive cycles of destruction and rebirth that shape history in the mythical world of Macondo. As the story unfolds it illuminates the wonders and terrors of the history of Latin American countries, the complexities and contradictions that have defined their peoples, and shaped their cultures. In this course we will read enjoy and analyze One Hundred Years of Solitude as well as a selection of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s short stories and journalistic works. The works will be discussed within the framework of major theoretical and historical issues and in constant dialogue with a variety of secondary sources."

Instead, students will construct characters and find voices through literature as well as through art, ethnography, current events, and even the campus and surrounding areas. Each week, careful analysis of texts by authors such as Silvina Ocampo, Valeria Luiselli, and Liliana Colanzi will highlight the reciprocity between reading and writing, while creative \u201clabs\u201d will cultivate story ideas. Practicing techniques such as listening and interviewing will help students generate material, and during in-class workshops they will receive feedback on drafts of their short stories.

We will consider the multilayered implications of extractive projects\u2014from gold mining in Venezuela to soy monoculture in Argentina\u2014as we analyze media including film, photography, and visual art. Paying special attention to the ways in which these objects suggest possibilities for life outside the politics of extraction, students will expand their understanding of how the study of media provides new perspectives on Latin America. Whether pushing for the legal rights of nature, centering Indigenous sovereignty, or shedding light on the role of women as community activists, the media we will study offer images of resistance and change in threatened territories."

In WRIT 3, students engage in the more sustained discourse of the research paper. These papers are not restricted to literary criticism but might employ the research protocol of other academic disciplines.

Curiously, the vast majority of eukaryotes reproduce sexually even though the evolution of meiosis involves substantial costs.  How meiosis evolved, and why it persists in sexual reproduction despite its many associated costs, are major unanswered questions in evolutionary biology.  This course will survey the literature on the evolutionary origins of meiosis and the maintenance of sexual reproduction.  We will explore the diversity of sexual and asexual modes of reproduction and related evolutionary phenomena with a focus on critically evaluating current research and theory in this area.\r"

Internship at another academic institution to perform research is discouraged; the goal of this internship program is to expose students to career environments not found within Dartmouth.

The aim of the mathematical models studied in this class is not to precisely reproduce experimental data, but rather to allow intuitive understanding of general principles.We will start by studying the organization of gene networks, and how transcription regulation is used to implement simple recurring network motifs. We will show how these network motifs can be used to build different synthetic circuits. We will then study the evolution of optimized network designs. We will see how cells tune their gene expression levels in response to new selective pressures; we will analyze how beneficial mutations are fixed in a cell population; and we will determine the possible paths of adaptation of an organism towards a new optimum when colonizing new environments.

To answer these questions, we will engage with primarily contemporary Asian/American works of literature, poetry, film, performance, and art that alters, disrupts, and varies Asian/American narratives of migration, assimilation, and upward mobility. Through these works, we will address historical processes of Asian/American racial, gender, and sexual formation by way of the \u201cbad\u201d and the \u201cqueer,\u201d as transformative political and aesthetic categories of inquiry that risk failing to fit in, being wrong, and not belonging."

We will begin by examining revolutionary nationalist and anti-imperialist culture in the Americas\u2014ranging from the memoirs of Che Guevara and Malcolm X to Nuyorican and Chicano Movement literature\u2014in order to consider the formation of revolutionary subjects, and how 20th century ideas of revolution were raced and gendered. We will then consider how novelists, artists, photographers, filmmakers, and activists attempted to imagine solidarity with revolutionary movements and suffering others in the Americas, from Central America solidarity photography to performance art in solidarity with Guantanamo Bay prisoners. We will pay special attention to the work of feminist and queer solidarity artists, writers, and performers. Finally, we will examine contemporary activist cultural projects, such as PanAmerican public art road trips and hashtag-activism.

We will analyze how language has been and is currently used to portray India, as we will think critically about how our perceptions of India have been shaped by what we have read, heard, and seen. Some questions we will address are: How have images of India been constructed over time? To what ends? What impact has colonialism had on how India was portrayed to the west? How did/do Indian writers use language to reclaim their country? How is feminism defined in India? How can we understand female agency in the Indian context? What role have women in India played and how has this female agency been incorporated into or excluded from representations of India developed into the subcontinent as well as outside of it?"

But what exactly might \u2018care\u2019 look like and for whom, particularly across labor intensive practices like higher learning, scholarly productivity, and community organizing? Across struggles for political liberation, how have racialized artists of various genders turn to performance, broadly conceived, as a way to experience self-care, collective repair, and meaningful healing? This course charts interdisciplinary formations and performative happenings that center notions of care, repair, liberation, and healing in the lives of communities of color and allied peers. Highlighting interlocking issues related to gender, sexuality, race, disability, and economics, we will mine live performance, staged plays, body art, land art, literature, spoken word, digital publics, and theoretical discourse. Over the course of 10 weeks, we will examine disciplinary methods, political investments, activist gestures, and everyday aesthetics that together may come to define aesthetic acts of care and healing. This query seeks not so much to account for what healing is, but what notions of healing can do at the intersection of performance and deviant identities. As such we will consider the inherent paradoxes\u2014limits and inevitable ruptures\u2014of performance as healing while seeking to conjure fierce possibilities for liberatory performance today. Across our discussions we will mine the fields of Black feminist thought, Lantinx feminisms, performance studies, visual cultures, and queer of color critique.

How do the intersections of gender, race, class, sexuality, citizenship, and religion play out in the context of transnational and global power dynamics?To answer these questions, we turn towards contemporary transnational feminist scholarship in sociology, anthropology, geography, and ethnic studies. Such perspectives are rooted in Black, Latinx and Third World feminist activism and scholarship that have begun the important work of decolonizing histories from the traditions of imperial dominion and white supremacy. In studies of globalization, these works point to critical interventions in understanding the modern world through frameworks of global and racial capitalism, neoliberalism, nation-building, and Western imperialism.These transformative studies examine how global political and economic processes shape and is shaped by racial, gender, and sexual relations and furthermore how the continued exploitation of racialized and gendered bodies around the globe produce/reproduce the international division of (re)productive labor. Departing from top-down models of globalization that are often discussed in other courses, this class will center and honor the voices of women and minoritarian workers on the peripheries of global society to understand to how global capitalistic institutions, particularly, workplaces and government are intimately intertwined on the ground. In doing so, we not only interrogate the racialized, gendered, and social dis(locations) of social actors and subjects under neoliberal economic globalization but also identifying forms of feminist resistance and agency that can shift racial and gender power dynamics across time and space.This class invites us to think relationally, historically, dynamically and use intersectionality as a lens to critique the power exercised by global institutions, corporations, and political processes. By grounding our analysis in the perspectives of women and minoritarian subjects, we can think about new ways forward in building cross-cultural solidarities and coalitions that can inspire abolition and expand concepts of liberation around the world."

        "course_description": "The practice of mothering is too often deemed a universal, innate experience that binds women together across time and space. Yet motherhood shares an intimate relationship with shifting, culturally specific histories of colonialism, nationalism, militarism, and more recently, globalization. Motherhood, and social reproduction more broadly, has served as a critical domain of power and knowledge production in these contexts. Because the experience of mothering connects the intimate experiences of individuals to larger structures and forces, and because reproduction is such a fundamental (if varied) biological and social experience, the topic lends its especially well to comparative analysis.This specific course employs the framework of mothering to compare the experiences of two communities constructed as \u201cforeign\u201d to the United States: Chicanx/Latinxs and Asian Americans. In situating motherhood as an ideological and cultural construction rather than a universal or natural phenomenon, we will compare closely affiliated histories of miscegenation, transracial adoption, domestic migrant labor, and assisted reproduction across the Americas and the Asian diaspora. How are these phenomena given especially potent life in Chicanx/Latinx, Asian American, and Asian diasporic cultural representations such as literature, documentary film, and television? In analyzing major scholarship and theories about mothering alongside these cultural texts, we will learn how differing notions of motherhood have been constructed, contested, and negotiated."

In Immigrant Acts, Lisa Lowe defines \u201chybridity\u201d as \u201cthe history of survival within relationships of unequal power and domination\u201d (67). According to Lowe, multidimensional lived experiences and survival strategies emerge when we investigate the antagonisms and alliances of empire, state, and capital. As a result, \u201chybridity\u201d does not only gesture to multigenre literature, but also to the intersectional identities and complex lived experiences we hold, the emergence of polyvocal, multisensory, and experimental productions, performances, and utterances we create as a testament to survival. Together, we will explore Asian American and Asian Diasporic productions of \u201chybridity\u201d and investigate how poets, writers, and artists create new worlds and alternate ways of being through art and thought."

        "course_description": "Throughout the twentieth century and especially since the 1970s, the literature and drama of the English Renaissance has provided a crucial archive for scholars studying the historical formation of sexuality, sex practices, and gender in pre-modern society. Shakespeare's sonnets, for example, with their erotic address to both a \"sweet boy\" (or \"master-mistress of my passion\") and the so-called Dark Lady, remain a flashpoint. On the English stage, cross-gender identification and same-gender romance was a constant presence, while in the streets of London, \"catamites,\" \"tribades,\" or acts of \"sodomy\" were supposed to be completely absent\u2014from the eyes of the law, at least. What can the poetry and plays of William Shakespeare, Amelia Lanyer, Christopher Marlowe, Margaret Cavendish, John Donne, or Katherine Phillips teach us, not only about the historically-distant practices of the past, but about our methods, theories, terms and changing paradigms for studying such topics today? What does it mean to read imaginative literature as an archive within an historically contingent body of knowledge? Students should prepare to engage with significant primary and secondary historical readings as well as the social theories of Michel Foucault, Eve Sedgwick, and others."

Expanding upon Perreault\u2019s nuanced consideration of how art works accumulate identities and address particular audiences, this undergraduate course will explore feminist and queer moving image-making practices in the United States between the 1950s-1990s. While eschewing a strictly chronological approach, we will consider art practices in relation to specific historical thresholds, from the intensification of nonviolent direct action in the 1950s and 1960s, to the Stonewall rebellions of 1969, to the emergence of AIDS activism in the late 1980s and 1990s. We will consider the term video expansively, inclusive of TV art, installation, and video\u2019s dialogue with film, holography, and print publications. This course leaves open what feminist and queer art practices look like and perform, and what methodologies might be most useful in writing about them.

What images, language, etc., are used to represent disability and madness as it intersects with Blackness? And finally, what things are made possible through a disabled and mad lens?

Digital storytellers \"write\" with a larger toolbox than words, adding power and dimension to the stories they tell by combining media, such as text, images, narration, animation, or interactive elements. Digital storytelling includes podcasts, videos, visual journalism, story maps, social media projects, websites, electronic publishing, virtual reality and more.It is also important to sharpen critical understanding of the digital medium's immediacy and global reach and examine how voices can be amplified in our hyper-connected world. How do we harness digital tools to best preserve and disseminate oral histories? What storytelling choices can we make to best engage audiences with oral histories including narratives that have been neglected?\u00a0Students will be encouraged to mine the resources of Dartmouth and the local community for content (options will be presented), though students are free to focus on the histories and stories they choose. No previous media experience is required. Bring your curiosity and willingness to explore.\u00a0"

Throughout the course, we will be investigating five questions:What is practical wisdom?When and why do we need it?How do we learn practical wisdom?What institutional forces threaten practical wisdom?How can institutions be designed to encourage and nurture practical wisdom?We will investigate these questions in several important domains in life - friendship, education, work, medicine, and family. Because practical wisdom is learned by reflecting on our own practices and experiences, we will rely heavily on stories about your own experiences that you will write and present in light of the theory and cases we read. Improving our own skills in reflective practice will also be encouraged by the format of the class which will rely on well-informed and thoughtful discussion in a seminar format.We will also investigate these questions more theoretically in an effort to develop a solid understanding of what makes wisdom or judgment a crucial component of our lives. Throughout the course, we will be contrasting decision-making that depends on practical wisdom with decision making that depends on following various kind of rules or responding to external rewards and punishments.This will be an interdisciplinary course with readings drawn from philosophy, ethics, literature, psychology, education, and sociology. Prior knowledge of these fields is not a prerequisite. We will frequently be joined by guests from other departments and from the Medical School."

Narrative is about giving form to what had been invisible, and personal narrative places one on the inside. Rather than looking in, one is in, and looks out. Writing the \"other\" is a way of avoiding self-absorption; at the same time, one could say that it's eventually about writing oneself, perhaps the ultimate \"other.\"In this nonfiction creative writing course, students will be asked to avoid any \"others\" that the culture imposes and ask who really are the ones we don't know and maybe can never know. There's no end to the list we could make, and what we think we know may be vastly different from what we really do. Attentiveness is central to the process, and students will begin an investigation that may yield unexpected insights. As we engage in this process, our understanding is enlarged, and this, we could say, is the essence of empathy: we read, we listen, we write, and we come away more educated. The window we create is also a mirror, and the images we see are larger than the frames."

Students will examine in greater detail the history of the Cold War, the transformation of the global power dynamic following the collapse of the Soviet Union, growing expectations for the spread of capitalism and democracy in the post-Cold War, the key challenges to liberal democracy and security today, the rise of China, and prospects for the future global leadership of the United States. The course will underscore the value of historical analysis to the interpretation of current events and demonstrate the confluence of forces that influence the making of foreign policy. The course will also encourage students to think like policy-makers, in part by drafting a series of short \"policy memos\" on specific recommended policy decisions and to advocate for these decisions in oral presentations.Following an introductory class discussing prospects for future U.S. global leadership, the course will examine the conduct of the Cold War, the transition from a bipolar power dynamic to a unipolar world led by the United States following the end of the Soviet Union, and then trace key themes and developments in U.S. foreign policy from the administrations of George H.W. Bush through Obama. Subsequent classes will examine the spread of market-based capitalist development and liberal democracy in the post Cold War, the ideology and driving forces of these movements, and the reactions to them. Global issues challenging both security and development, such as international terrorism and crime will be examined in detail. One class will be specifically dedicated to China's potential as a power rival to the United States. The final two classes will look ahead to future prospects for democracy, capitalist-led growth and the growing transition away from uni-polarity to a new multi-polar global order.

Evolution acts on genes, not on organisms; what are the genetic factors that have been identified in recent primate brain growth? What mechanisms are at play, including extrinsic factors and evolutionary \u201cpressures\u201d? What criteria must theories of brain evolution conform to, and what data are to be accounted for?

Students attend a number of required performances and in addition attend performances of their own choosing - normally a total of three plays per week. Productions will represent a variety of periods and styles of playwriting, and a similarly diverse range of production companies and approaches to performance. Weekly seminar meetings will focus on critical responses to plays and productions, with background provided by guests from the professional theater (directors, writers, performers, designers, critics). Students will maintain journals and provide brief written critiques."

These components of population change (mortality, fertility, and migration) help us better understand the impact of population composition and change.

The goal of this course is to better understand the nature of Jews as a genos/race/ethos/people as they are labeled by others as well as how they self-identify.

The conventional sociological understanding of race and ethnicity focuses on difference. That is, although sociologists take pains to argue that racial and ethnic differences are socially constructed, the vast, long-standing inequality among racial and ethnic groups make it very tempting to perceive the status quo as inevitable, if not natural. In order to counter this trend, we have to center the concept of power and trace how racial and ethnic divisions came to emerge from the political struggles of the past. And in doing so, it is crucial to understand not only successes but also failures of white supremacy\u2014namely that non-whites have always disrupted workings of the dominant system, sometimes through electoral politics and other times through direct action.\u00a0"

In this course, we trace the development of statistics and quantitative analysis through modern times in an attempt to understand how they have been used and perceived in society. We also address recent controversies surrounding their implementation in businesses and government institutions, especially in relation to algorithmic decision making. In the process, we will establish that statistics and quantitative data are not just abstract, formal tools whose meanings are absolute and obvious, but that they are social constructs embedded in particular institutions, such as the state and market."

How can we learn to understand and respect each other\u2019s differences while promoting equality in healthcare? This course guides future public health leaders on their journey to explore our differences and their effects on society, public health, and access to health care and health outcomes. Specifically, the course helps students 1) understand how Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) relate to belonging;\u00a0 2) understand barriers (i.e. Implicit Bias, Systemic Racism, and White Supremacy) that manifest in some of the most vexing health problems of our lifetime, (Food Insecurity, Maternal Mortality and Barriers to Access to Care) and prevent successful integration of DEI in health policies and interventions; and 3) practice skills that will allow them to anticipate, recognize and redress health system barriers that prevent fair distribution of resources and prevent all from receiving equitable care. \u00a0 This course will complement student\u2019s work in Epidemiology, Biostatistics, Improvement Methods, Environmental Health, Health Policy and International Health.\u00a0PH 243 contains modules on Implicit Bias, Food Insecurity & Systemic RacismPH 244 contains modules on\u00a0 Maternal Mortality, White Supremacy & Barriers to Access in Care0.30 Dartmouth units (each year) (CT, NC)Required for Online MPHOffered:\u00a0Course offered alternates each year"
