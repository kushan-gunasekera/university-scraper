While most medical research focuses on the biology of disease, this course takes a biosocial approach to unmask how social factors, economic insecurity, and the availability of massive amounts of pharmaceuticals have become an overdose crisis. In the first part of the course, we explore the connection between opioid addiction and crime, especially under conditions of poverty, chaos, and violence. Then, we explore how people search for health care and support when condemned to precarious lives. By investigating the opioid epidemic in this way, students are encouraged to think boldly and creatively beyond the traditional boundaries of medicine; perhaps someone's best medicine is a housing voucher or a testing strip to detect fentanyl. By the end of the course, students understand the social roots of the opioid epidemic and how solutions may be implemented."

We consider questions such as: how do the different kinds of exchanges we engage in\u2014gift exchanges versus market exchanges, for instance\u2014shape our relationships with others? We explore the social meaning of money and the role of the market in our lives. In a world where it is possible to rent a family, does money destroy love and intimacy? What aspects of our lives are governed by the logic of capitalism and what aspects escape capitalism's grip? Why does it feel shameful to be in debt and how has this shame been manipulated for political purposes? Why in the US do we consider work to be sacred and morally purifying even though many of us have tedious jobs? The course readings include theoretical and empirical works drawn mainly from the fields of anthropology, economic sociology, and heterodox economics."

However, the last 200 years are not the only period of drastic environmental change in Earth's history. In the 4.5 billion years since forming, Earth has experienced an atmosphere devoid of oxygen, been covered by glaciers, and hosted mass extinctions caused by both increases and decreases in temperature. This course aims to give students a deep-time perspective on Earth's climate, insights into the mechanisms controlling it, and the impacts of those changes. Students get hands-on experience examining and evaluating the supporting evidence during lab activities in addition to reading primary literature. We start by understanding Earth as a system, what the current state of that system is, controlling factors on climate, and how climate changes. The course then focuses on individual periods of dramatic climatic shifts including oxidation of the atmosphere (2.5 billion years ago), global glaciation (720-635 million years ago), sea level drop from global cooling (443 million years ago), massive volcanism (254 and 66 million years ago), asteroid impact (66 million years ago), and the impact of planetary cycles. Understanding the causes and consequences of past climatic events prepares students to better examine the current period of global climate changes and potential futures of Earth. Each class includes time for paper discussion, lectures on new material, and lab activities focused on evaluating evidence. For the final project, students select a policy or regulation that could mitigate the impacts of climate change. They research what the policy aims to address, how it would work, and its potential effectiveness before presenting on the last day of class.

Family can be a safe space: it is a source of profound love, immense sacrifice, and courageous solidarity. But family may also threaten grave dangers: old resentments blossom, new disputes loom, and the weight of ancient wrongs is never fully relieved. In this interdisciplinary course, we explore the transgressive acts committed in the name of family\u2014for love, for rage, for vengeance\u2014as well as the artistic dialogues surrounding them through the ages. This journey begins with some of the most notoriously dysfunctional families ever depicted\u2014those of Heracles, Medea, Oedipus, and Agamemnon in the tragic dramas of ancient Greece. Devoting particular attention to the theatrical construction of gender in family relationships, we consider how Athenian drama figured in the societal controversies of its time and why it continues to be relevant today. With these dramatic works as our template, we move to their contemporary analogue in <i>The Godfather</i> cinematic trilogy, in which notions of family honor spur shocking acts of violence. Throughout the course, we have frequent opportunity to consider why visions of fate, criminal wrongdoing, and inherited guilt continue to haunt popular depictions of family even today."

A country's ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker. Doing so demands leveraging the power of technology in sectors like energy, medicine, and transportation. Innovations in these sectors include drills that can bore deeper, drugs that have a longer shelf life, and airplanes that can fly further\u2014all of which have worked to alter economic status quo. This course explores the consequences\u2014both good and bad\u2014that technological progress has on consumers, firms, and governments.

Though the science is abundantly clear regarding humankind's anthropogenic influence, there remains staunch disagreement regarding how the problem should be framed and understood, what exactly should be done about it, and who should take on those tasks. This course delves into these questions by first asking: what kind of problem is climate change? Should climate change be primarily understood as a technical problem, an economic problem, a moral one, or something else? Students investigate different ways of understanding the challenge climate change poses, exploring the advantages and drawbacks of each approach. With an understanding of the problem in hand, we turn towards the second main question: what sort of solutions should we pursue in the fight against climate change? Should the market be the primary tool for addressing the problem? Should we rest our faith in technologies like carbon removal and solar geoengineering? Or should we focus on living smaller lifestyles and producing and consuming less overall? What should we do if efforts to promote the right solutions end up unsuccessful because of the vested interests of powerful people and corporations? Who is the &quot;we&quot; under consideration in these questions? This interdisciplinary course addresses these questions from the perspective of economics, politics, and ethics, with special attention paid to the way ethical considerations make their way into current ways of framing the climate change problem and proposed solutions. On the last day of class, students put their new understanding of the problem to work during a day of climate action."

In this course, we explore the politics of the energy transition in the United States. We rely on insights primarily from political science, but also consult economics, sociology, public policy, and environmental science. We consider how the energy transition affects industrial sectors, such as manufacturing and fossil fuels, as well as the communities on the front lines of both economic and climate change. We evaluate why some decarbonization policies are more successful than others and how different regions of the country may take different approaches to climate mitigation. We also take into account the obstacles to collective action around the energy transition by examining public opinion and interest group engagement in climate politics.

Why are some countries stable, while others spiral into violent conflict? This course engages students with major theories and foundational ideas from political science that seek to answer these big comparative questions. In doing so, the course introduces students to the field of comparative politics and to the practice of social scientific inquiry. The substantive focus of the course through the first week is on democracy. When do democracies fail? How do countries become democracies, and why do some get there but not others? And finally, how do dictatorships work? We consider cases from eighteenth-century France to the fall of authoritarianism in Latin America and Eastern Europe in just the past few decades. The second week surveys the remainder of the comparative politics literature across two big topics: economic development and conflict. Why are some countries rich and others poor? We examine economic successes like Singapore and South Korea as well as failures like Kenya and Venezuela. Why are some countries stable, while others experience violence and conflict? We compare political violence from medieval Europe to current-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. Through the lens of these three big topics\u2014democracy, development, and conflict\u2014students receive a broad lay of the land of the field of comparative politics. The course also focuses on three skills: reading, writing, and scientific inquiry. Students independently read published academic books and articles, while receiving in-class guidance on how to read the kind of professional scholarship they would be expected to consume in college. Students generate their own research designs on a social science question of interest and have an opportunity to present their designs to their peers in a simulated conference setting. Finally, students learn basic principles of scientific inquiry, with an emphasis on the comparative method and on the distinction between the social sciences, the humanities, and public policy."

This course draws on insights from political science, sociology, and economics to unpack the black box of criminal organizations. The course is organized in three sections. First, we explore the nature and origins of four dominant types of criminal groups: mafias (with a focus on the Sicilian Mafia), trafficking organizations (with a focus on Mexican drug cartels), street gangs (with a focus on MS-13), and prison gangs (with a focus on the Brazilian PCC and American prison gangs). Next, we explore the consequences of criminal organizations for the societies in which they operate, with a focus on violence, governance, corruption, and democracy. Finally, we search for solutions: what, if anything, can governments do to address organized crime effectively? Throughout the course, most of our evidence comes from Latin America\u2014the world's current organized crime hotspot\u2014but we also look at examples from Italy and the United States."

Certain recurring themes are guiding threads throughout this chronological exploration. We look at the ways the state has controlled membership in the citizen body and how ethnicity, race, gender and empire shaped access to the country and to citizenship. Then, we explore the different ways foreigners were identified and categorized and the changing landscape of immigration administration: the census, alien registration, border enforcement, internment, detention, and deportation.

During the age of revolutions, enslaved people across the New World, from Brazil to New York, embarked on their own revolutionary journeys that ran counter to the wars of independence in the Americas and the French Revolution. In doing so, they reshaped notions of freedom, community, and Black identity in ways that are fundamental to present day society. This course examines slave rebellions and resistance to slavery in the Atlantic world. Students learn about the history of slavery and the history of Black opposition to slavery.

For tens of millions of Americans, especially those who are poor, African American, Hispanic, or Native American, the prison system is the most well-funded and consistent presence of government in their lives. How did this happen? What were the historical forces, actors, and events that created this system of incarceration? Does it need to be this way? Can we as a nation respond to the problems of crime and drug addiction differently? What could alternatives look like? This course unpacks the historical origins of mass incarceration in the United States from the decades of Prohibition and internment in the 1920s and 1930s to our recent past with the War on Drugs in the 1980s and the immigration detention programs of the Trump administration in the late 2010s.

This includes 'zines in the southern California punk scene; eight-star quilting in the windswept communities of the Great Plains; poppets in Salem amid the witch-panic of the seventeenth century; and basket-weaving among the Wabanaki in what is today called Maine. Each is meant to engage different aspects of craft and society, including race, gender, class, and sexuality, to reveal the power of the ordinary in the lives of everyone. Each micro-history is accompanied by a workshop, whereby students engage in the kind of crafting discussed that day. In each of the two weeks, students participate in one outing, including one visit to the Harvard Art Museum and one to the Houghton Library."

But how did indigenous people living under colonialism tell the story of Spanish invasion? How did they recall and narrate events that pre-dated Spanish presence? How do historians tell the story of past lives that were almost entirely left out of the historical record? This introductory course to the history of colonial Latin America encourages students to tackle these and other challenging questions in an effort to better comprehend indigenous understandings of the past. Together, we explore the many ways native people told stories about what had transpired, including their use of oral histories, material culture, and unique recording devices. We also learn from the wide array of methodologies that historians and other scholars have employed to unearth the history of indigenous people. A main objective of this course is to introduce students to foundational methods of historical enquiry; for this purpose, we explore a diverse set of primary and secondary sources that draw on examples from both North and South America. Daily required readings give students the opportunity to hone critical reading and analysis skills, as well as to become familiar with diverse scholars' takes on some of the most important and controversial questions in the field of colonial Latin American indigenous history. Likewise, in-class discussions give students the opportunity to ask questions, clarify concepts, and engage in fruitful discussions with their peers. We also make several museum visits where students are able to see the material objects that we discuss in class."

In this course, we explore the origins of Homo sapiens and how debates over our origins led some thinkers to consider human populations as multiple different species. Through a historical lens, we examine how such thinking permeated into society, affected political policy, contributed to the development of biased medical research, justified the management and control of marginalized populations, and fueled movements such as eugenics and white supremacy. Returning to science, we consider empirical genetic evidence and what it reveals about human variation. This allows us to contrast the historical placement of humans into categories with new understandings of human variation as a distribution across the geographic landscape, influenced by evolutionary forces. Finally, we ask how these themes help us understand racial issues today and how science can be an aid in combating racism. Students leave the course as more critical thinkers able to decipher scientific evidence, societal influence on scientists, and their lasting implications."

Do citizens have a duty to obey the law in a racially unjust society? Is it morally permissible for law enforcement to engage in racial profiling? Is mass incarceration best understood as caused by racist motivations? Are prisons inherently racist institutions? Students learn and develop their critical-thinking skills to analyze complex problems with clarity and nuance.

But for all this, specifying exactly what the question is and how one could go about answering it is deeply puzzling. This course seeks to tackle those puzzles, bringing the resources of critical thinking to bear upon the meaning of life to discover what the question is, why we are so compelled to ask it, and what this can tell us about our existential predicament and perhaps our modern way of life. We do this by analyzing the views of thinkers from across history who have grappled with the question\u2014beginning with contemporary philosophers like AJ Ayer who have challenged our ability to even make sense of the question, and then reaching back to ancient views (Aristotle and Seneca) through the medievals (Augustine and Dante), and finally making our way back up to modern times (S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Albert Camus, and Thomas Nagel).

This course considers a line of thinking in twentieth-century philosophy that seeks to show that the psychological life of a human being cannot be explained on the model of the other empirical sciences. In this connection, we explore how it is that human beings come to understand a language, how to understand the nature of the self and subjectivity, and in what ways these topics relate to talk of conscious states, mental processes, and sensations. Investigating these topics leads us to consider questions at the foundation of psychology, cognitive science, and the philosophy of mind, and should be of interest to anyone looking to take an interdisciplinary approach to understanding human mental life. Readings include excerpts from the writings of Ludwig Wittgenstein, his followers, and his critics."

This course explores the practice of scientific inquiry across multiple disciplines, and prepares students with the foundational skills and knowledge necessary to do scientific research. Students read from the social sciences (political science, sociology, and economics), clinical psychology, neurobiology, epidemiology, public health, physical therapy, marine biology, and cell biology. We critically examine the broad philosophical principles that define science as a privileged source of knowledge, the practices and protocols involved in running a scientific study (including research design and statistical standards of evidence), and the sociology and politics of science as a profession, including workplace structure, peer review, and the representation of scientific knowledge in the public sphere. We explore the full range of types of evidence, from case studies and focus groups to longitudinal cohort studies, randomized control trials, and controlled lab experiments. We also learn about the diversity of jobs that make science happen\u2014from project coordinators to statisticians to survey directors to lab techs. Students become educated consumers of scientific work who can critically evaluate published research in any discipline that employs the scientific method. Students completing this course can expect to make more informed choices about going into research in any field, and if they do so, to be prepared with all the tools necessary to start doing scientific research."

First, students gain foundational knowledge of key concepts in social medicine, including an overview of health institutions and the arguments for health as a human right. We then turn to what we can call chronic emergencies\u2014case studies of people and communities who have been denied health care and allowed to suffer and die because they are poor, uninsured, undocumented, or otherwise social outcasts. Case studies are drawn from across the globe, with significant attention given to global surgery, cancer care in settings of deprivation, and mental health care. By the end of the course, students not only understand concepts and case studies in global health and social medicine, but also strategies and interventions to build health systems, make house calls, and provide a preferential option for the poor."

In thinking through how arts and culture are shaped by historical context, we examine the legacy of colonization and US intervention in the hemisphere, racialization and identity, immigration, and gender and sexuality in the formation of the groups we have come to understand as Latinx over the course of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. As an interdisciplinary course, we pull methods and theories from ethnic studies, American studies, gender and sexuality studies, history, and literary criticism. Some key questions that guide our course are: what are the benefits and challenges to understanding arts and culture from a historical perspective? How do we learn history from the arts and culture around us? What ideologies can we uncover through reading different genres of artistic production? How has cultural production shaped the different ways that Latinidad is imagined? What are the circuits of cultural exchange between the United States and Latin American and the Caribbean?"

Stuck in a frustrating period of waithood, or waiting for adulthood, urban youths in Africa are increasingly devising enterprising ways to improvise their livelihoods and assert their right to the city. One creative way in which youths are responding to everyday uncertainty and frustration is through the power of pop culture, which includes creating new artistic, musical, performance, and fashion forms that extend across and beyond African cities. Consider, for example, the cross-cultural power and global appeal of Afrobeats. Notable American musicians, from Beyonc\u00e9 to Pharrell Williams are fast integrating African pop music into their sounds as part of the upward trend of the Afro-Cool in the United States. This raises important questions about the boundaries between what is cultural appreciation and what is cultural appropriation. In the face of the contradictions of modern city life in Africa, in which people's opportunities and expectations are simultaneously broadened and constrained, how do young people fashion new ways of being and interacting with society? In what ways can crisis become opportunity? To address these questions, we watch films, listen critically to music, analyze written texts, take virtual tours, and visualize fashion and popular art forms that shed new light on the hustle economy in urban Africa, its relationship with pop culture in American cities, and the innovative ways in which young people are making their voices heard in the city."

Food and nutrition, primary and recurrent needs of all human beings, also become deeply entrenched in social meaning making. Our intimate experiences of food as something we consume in our bodies create social niches in which the consumption of luxury items by connoisseurs allows for claims of superior status, taste, and ethics. This course examines the intersection of race, class, and consumption in historical and contemporary food politics. Together, we analyze the interplay of food and labor, taste and power, race and consumption, community and capitalism, luxury and inequality, food sovereignty and celebrity, fandom and social status, and responsibility and repair. We explore elements of the mundane\u2014the morning pastry, the bottle of water, or the spices forgotten in our cabinets\u2014all items that not only play a role in the movement of billions of dollars around the world, but also in the access to fundamental rights and equity in the lives of all people.

Through readings, podcast listening, discussions, and a spectrum of hands-on experiences, including field excursions, we explore the production, distribution, and consumption of food in a range of cultures and contexts. From family meals and dumpster diving to artisanal cheeses and farmers' markets, the course addresses the ways food shapes not only our relationships with people, but to our environment, our community, and other nations and cultures. We interrogate not only what food is but what constitutes good food. We examine what can, cannot, and should not be eaten; what role food plays in the creation of community and the construction of identity; and the intersection of food activism and social justice. We explore changes to food systems, in particular transformations in food production and distribution, and the impact of industrial diets on the body, lives, and livelihoods. While engaging with debates that animate the anthropological study of food, students draw on readings, audio, and visual sources, and employ empirical methods to research a dimension of their immediate foodscape."

Social medicine is a discipline that examines how political, economic, and historic forces become embodied as pathologies and how the same forces that create uneven distribution of disease also create barriers to care. Some of the pathologies we examine are addiction, hunger, homelessness, mental illness, and homicide, all worsened by racism, sexism, and sometimes the very institutions that ought to help. In this course, we emphasize understanding the observations, judgements, and calls to action from people who endure the miseries of poverty. To do so, students read ethnographic research in medical anthropology and learn directly from community members during class visits. Students complete three group ethnographic exercises which take them to a jail, ask them to report on a program for the homeless, and create an act of service based on what they learn from their informants is a specific need for physical survival."

In particular, much is being learned about Mars and Venus because of the many recent and ongoing space missions. Spectacular data from Jupiter's and Saturn's moons, like Titan, Europa, and Enceladus, show that these moons may become possible targets of future searches for life. Geochemists are finding more and more intriguing clues about the Earth's past by analyzing rocks dating from the very first period after the Earth's formation, thus providing a fundamentally new context for research on the transition between chemistry and primordial life. And the search for extra-solar planets is leading to the discovery of Earth-like planets around solar-type stars. In this course, students are introduced to current and planned telescopic space missions aimed at finding and characterizing exoplanets and robotic missions, such as the Mars rovers.

Demographic (Malthusian) factors, evolutionary (Darwinian) forces, genetic (Mendelian) principles, and ecological (environmental) factors either collectively or independently influence differential survival and reproduction rates among individuals of diverse populations of organisms, including humans. We call these Darwinian processes. In parallel, epidemiology and public health deal with the distribution and determinants of human diseases and mortality. They investigate the origin, distribution, management, and control of agents that cause both communicable and non-communicable diseases within and between populations among a wide range of species. This course offers a comprehensive understanding of how the foundational principles of evolutionary genetics and public health intersect to shape human health and longevity. Through an interdisciplinary approach, we explore the nexus of evolutionary genetics and public health, contextualizing our discussions within the broader spheres of comparative medicine and environmental factors, such as global warming. This approach illuminates the collective influence of Darwinian processes on the evolution, maintenance, and spread of diseases. The ultimate aim is to showcase how evolutionary genetics and epidemiology can converge to pave the way for a more focused approach to healthcare, often promoted as precision medicine."

Human metabolism is like that of other animals in many ways, yet unique and derived in important aspects. In this course we explore human metabolism from the molecular level to the ecological level using the lens of evolution to understand the various processes that make up metabolism, as well as their interactions and integration across a person's body. The course includes a review of energetics, thermodynamics, and molecular physiology followed by in-depth study of molecular and cellular metabolism and the processes of digestion and substrate utilization. We then zoom out to study energy allocation and metabolic regulation within specific tissues and across the entire body, exploring behavioral and hormonal control of the underlying processes. The course finishes by looking at metabolic ecology, the decisions people make about activity and food and the effect of variation in human lifestyles on metabolism, and the evolution of the unique human metabolic strategy since our divergence from our ape ancestors. The course also includes four labs that provide hands-on experience measuring metabolism in humans and explore foundational principles in human energetics."

        "course_description": "The study of decision making has a long tradition, particularly in economics, where the choices of economic agents have been analyzed with the aid of a number of methodologies and theoretical models. Many academic researches and empirical evidence show how institutional and retail investors are inclined to make mistakes when making financial decisions; moreover, people do not have stable preferences, but make choices that are influenced by the context\u2014and the feelings\u2014in which individuals are asked to make a decision. Neuroscience methodologies applied to investments (so-called neuroinvesting) help to explain these anomalies, highlighting how investors' brains and bodies react to different stimuli and situations. In-depth knowledge of neuroinvesting foundations is then crucial for making informed decisions and therefore better choices, which are consistent with investors' needs and expectations. This course aims to help participants to understand practical impacts and benefits that neuroscience applied to investments has on investors' decision-making processes. Starting from an overview about what neuroscience is and how brain activity can be measured, the course describes the underlying mechanisms related to motivations and to judgments under risk and uncertainty. The course focuses on the role of emotions and on investors' risk perception and risk tolerance. The course ends by introducing pathological choices, ethics, and trust."

What does Latinidad look like when we trace it back 530 years, when we take 1492 to be its starting point instead of the twentieth century? How might this look backwards help us understand the current Latinx politics of gender (Latino versus Latina versus Latinx), sexuality (the place of queerness and transness in Latinx studies), and race (Latinidad's penchant for disavowing blackness and erasing indigeneity)? We answer these questions as we move through different historical and literary periods in dialogue with writing by, for example, colonial Spanish historian Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, nineteenth-century Cuban intellect Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed from exile in New York, twentieth-century queer Chicana theorist Gloria Anzald\u00faa, and contemporary Honduran-Garifuna writer Janel Mart\u00ednez."

        "course_description": "This seminar surveys the theoretical and empirical literature on the influence of domestic politics on foreign policy and international politics, with a primary, though not exclusive, emphasis on American foreign policy. Scholars have long recognized that domestic politics influences states' decision making in international trade and finance. Yet, in recent years we have witnessed an explosion of interest in understanding the linkage between domestic politics and international relations more broadly, including the decidedly high politics arena of war and peace. We review a variety of theoretical perspectives concerning both international economics and international security, ranging from the role of individuals and individual psychology, to the influence of interest groups, political institutions, the mass media, and public opinion. The goal is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of domestic political explanations for policy outcomes in foreign policy and international affairs."

        "course_description": "Propaganda has been a factor in politics since antiquity, but in an age when social media has made disseminating ideas easier than ever and the terms fake news and alternative facts have entered the popular lexicon, it appears particularly pernicious. Studying what political propaganda is, as well as by whom (and how) it is disseminated and what its goals are, is therefore particularly relevant today. This course begins by looking at the history of the term and its theoretical underpinnings, distinguishing it from related but nevertheless distinct forms of persuasive speech (for example, advertising, op-eds, and polemics) and obvious misinformation. Next, we examine various examples of propaganda and their manifestations, both historical as well as more contemporaneous (for example, World War I and World War II, Russian and Chinese troll farms, and the 2021 US Capitol riot). The course concludes by considering the normative implications of political propaganda for the societies we live in."

How can the international community address these global challenges? One solution is called global governance, a central part of which is the United Nations (UN) and its many related organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). In this course, students learn about major challenges facing humankind, how the UN addresses them, and the UN's successes and limitations. We focus on the UN's key issues of maintaining peace and security, protecting human rights, and promoting sustainable development and climate action. Students engage with theories of international relations that explain state behavior and foundations of international law that constrain state actions. Students independently study an issue of their interest and develop insights as to how global governance may contribute to a solution. In short, this is a course on how the UN tries to save the planet\u2014and the challenges it faces in doing so."

From France's anti-immigrant National Front and neo-Nazis in Germany to efforts to rehabilitate Francisco Franco and Benito Mussolini in Spain and Italy, forces of extreme nationalism, xenophobia, and imperial nostalgia have increased in prominence as well as popularity. The current moment is not, of course, the first time that the continent has experienced a rise in right-wing extremism. Fascism, from the 1920s onward, likewise offered violent, totalitarian solutions to the tensions of mass politics and populist resentment in polarized societies. How, precisely, do today's reactionary political formations relate to their fascistic forebears? What social and cultural dynamics is each responding to and, perhaps just as significantly, what historical legacies are they drawing on? In this course, we ask how has the present wave of far-right parties in western and central Europe tapped into notions of national decline, instability, and changing demographics? What can we learn about these movements by studying histories of European fascism in France, Germany, Spain, and Italy? And finally, how have these histories been obscured and rehabilitated in different ways in each of these countries? By moving from contemporary cases of resurgent nationalist sentiment to their interwar predecessors and back again, and through a consideration of novels, films, historical documents, speeches, and monuments, the course seeks to uncover how anxieties of migration, race, and empire\u2014as well as changing roles of religion, gender, and nationhood\u2014shaped political animosities and allegiances within the European far right both a century ago and today."

        "course_description": "Ladino, or Judeo-Spanish, is the linguistic legacy of Sepharad, the Hebrew term for the Iberian Peninsula, which for over a thousand years was home to a vibrant Jewish cultural life. The Jewish presence in modern-day Spain and Portugal was established in antiquity and eliminated, violently and systematically, through the series of tribunals, expulsions, and mass conversions organized under the Inquisition. Although the language\u2014with its signature blend of Hispano-Romance and Hebraic elements\u2014disappeared from the Iberian Peninsula long ago, it lives on in the Sephardic diaspora, in Israel and, to a lesser extent, the United States as well as Turkey, where for centuries ancestrally Spanish and Portuguese Jews intermingled with their Ottoman hosts, acquiring numerous loanwords in the process. As its community of native speakers contracts, Judeo-Spanish today faces a future perhaps more uncertain than that which it faced on Iberian soil when the Inquisition began in 1492. Blending conventional coursework in language instruction with elements of literary and cultural studies, this course is a first experiment in reviving the language at home, in Cambridge. In class we explore a series of basic provocations about the nature of the language, including: just how capacious is the term Ladino? Is an <i>aljamiado</i> (that is, Hebrew-script) text in Spanish by default a Ladino text? What distinguishes, culturally and concretely, this language from Old Spanish and its modern descendants? In addition to supporting students' progress in reading, writing, and rudimentary oral and aural skills, the course attempts to trace the long line connecting us, as learners, to the Romance-speaking Jews of medieval Iberia\u2014and to appreciate the cultural artefacts by which that lineage is so spectacularly distinguished."

How have struggles against gender injustice intersected and conflicted with struggles against racial, ethnic, environmental, health, LGBTQIA+, and other forms of injustice? Gender justice, as is true of justice more broadly, is often discussed in the abstract or as a matter of law, political history, protest movements, enfranchisement, and similar phenomena. Yet at its core, justice involves individuals and their experiences\u2014both their suffering and their triumphs\u2014most directly accessed through stories. In this course we explore a range of stories and different forms of storytelling on gender justice, from novels and films to memoirs and personal histories, histories, and creative nonfiction.

Why be moral when being immoral could provide access to wealth, fame, and power? What do people owe a society that has failed in its obligations to its people? How can we identify and resist oppression, marginalization, and injustice? Human beings have been thinking about and debating questions like these for thousands of years. This course explores the history of ethics and moral philosophy from a genuinely inclusive perspective by focusing on ethical thought from all over the world, with special emphasis on marginalized groups that have typically received little attention in academic philosophy."

In this course, we explore the rich traditions of Indian Buddhist philosophy. More specifically, we discuss topics in Buddhist epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, philosophy of action, and philosophy of mind. We pay particular attention to the arguments that Buddhist philosophers used to defend their views and respond to their critics. In addition to understanding these arguments in their historical contexts, we ask what we can learn from them today and, when relevant, investigate how they are being used in contemporary philosophy."

This course investigates the moral, social, and political implications of these and other new technologies. How should we understand privacy and surveillance in the age of metadata? Will emerging biotechnologies and life-tracking metrics allow us to re-engineer humanity? Should we edit our genes or those of our children to extend human lives and enhance human abilities? Can geo-engineering resolve the climate crisis? How will artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics change the work world? Can machines be conscious and what would it mean if they can? Will AI help us reduce bias and combat bigotry or make things worse? What does the explosion of social media mean for human agency? How can we live an act in meaningful ways in a world increasingly dominated by technological and capital forces? This course explores how technology and our attitudes toward it are transforming who we are, what we do, how we make friends, care for our health, and conduct our social and political lives. In doing so, we also investigate fundamental philosophical and ethical questions about agency, integrity, virtue, the good, and what it means to be human in an uncertain and shifting world."

But exactly because of their impressive powers to alter the workings of body and mind, the dual uses of the same technologies make them attractive also to people who are not sick but who would use them to look younger, perform better, feel happier, or become more perfect. These applications of biotechnology are already presenting us with some unfamiliar and very difficult challenges. In this course, we consider such possible beyond therapy uses, and explore both their scientific basis and the ethical and social issues they are likely to raise. We consider how pursuing the goals of better children, superior performance, ageless bodies, or happy souls might be aided or hindered, elevated or degraded, by seeking them through a wide variety of technological means. Among the biotechnological techniques considered are techniques for screening genes and testing embryos, choosing sex of children, modifying the behavior of children, augmenting muscle size and strength, enhancing athletic performance, slowing senescence, blunting painful memories, brightening mood, and altering basic temperaments. Toward the end of the course, we begin to ask what kinds of human beings and what sort of society we might be creating in the coming age of biotechnology."

        "course_description": "We frequently look upon the modern world and characterize it in naturalistic and secular terms. But at the extremities of human behavior and human suffering, whether individual or social, we find ourselves calling people, groups, and situations evil. What do we mean by this? What is the difference between something being evil, or just wrong? What typifies actions we deem evil and what should we do about them? What does our appeal to evil say about our sense of humanity, religion, and God? And how do we cope with suffering? This course takes up these questions through a variety of lenses drawn from Western thought: religious, philosophical, theological, and ethical. Readings include Jewish and Christian scriptures (the books of Genesis, Job, and Paul), classic theologians and philosophers (St. Augustine, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Immanuel Kant), novelists (Fyodor Dostoevsky and Annie Dillard), and contemporary critics (Susan Neiman, Hannah Arendt, and Haim Gouri). The last portion of the course turns from ideas to situations, looking at cases such as the Adolf Eichmann trial, the use of evil in contemporary American political discourse, our location relative to nature, and a parent's reaction to the murder of a child to query our contemporary thinking about evil and suffering."

How do these things happen? This course explores the psychological mechanisms that enable cults to form and to take things to such extremes. What do cults share with other groups (mainstream religions, nations, and everyday social interactions), and what makes them stand apart? In what ways are cults an environment in which many of our psychological tendencies (toward ingroup conformity, heuristic decision making, and rationalization) are magnified?

The course emphasizes the evolutionary nature of the data science enterprise as an artificial ecosystem, where the phrase artificial shares a similar connotation as it is in the phrase artificial intelligence (AI). However, unlike the common algorithmic or robotic depictions of AI, this course espouses a panoramic view of data science, from philosophical conceptualization of data to interpretation and policy implications of statistical findings and to the re-use of data for addressing scientific replicability and reliability. Topics such as generative AI and data privacy are explored in depth to demonstrate the necessity of the panoramic approach. Questions such as what is intelligence or what is privacy require philosophical contemplation, while assessing the impact of generative AI or means to protect individual privacy demand careful sociological, computational, and statistical thinking. Furthermore, determining how to ensure effective and safe human-computer interaction requires advanced data science theory and methods. Throughout the course, students engage with and critique a broad range of data science articles that incorporate perspectives from computer science, statistics, philosophy, social sciences, and other fields of study. During course meetings, there are opportunities to discuss some of these articles with the authors themselves."

It aims to further a dynamic understanding of American dreams (for there are many and not just one), to apprehend their complexities and contradictions, to appreciate their diverse manifestations and historical shapes, and above all to take measure of their presence and meaning in the world we now inhabit. To this end we study the variety of ways in which feature filmmakers, both in and outside of Hollywood studios, have created designs for living; indeed, the most influential and resonant incarnations of American dreams. We analyze popular narratives produced during crucial junctures in the modern history of the United States, from the Great Depression and World War II, through the cold war and the McCarthy era, up to the late 1960s. We consider the wide range of functions that these productions have assumed, how they have by turns sustained and questioned the status quo. In some instances they have interrogated, revealed, and even indicted social inequity, at other times they have legitimated injustice and fostered exclusion."

We examine recurring historical patterns of financial bubbles, from tulips to bitcoins, without overlooking critical differences and historical contexts. If history repeats itself, why can't we avoid making the same mistakes repeatedly? The 2008 financial crisis happened at a time when mainstream macroeconomists (including the former Federal Reserve Chairmen Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke) could not even imagine that such a meltdown was within the realm of possibilities. Instead, they were emphasizing the great moderation, that is, the idea that business cycles had vanished for all practical purposes. These economists were wrong because they disregarded warning signs and used inadequate economic models to gauge the situation. Similarly, the COVID-19 recession occurred just at the time when pundits were boasting of a roaring economy. We also assess our current economic situation, including the bailout of Wall Street that failed to pay adequate attention to the problems faced by the everyman on Main Street and the ways in which it contributed to the rise of populism. We conclude with the analysis of the financial challenges in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic."

Rapid economic growth, urbanization, and increasing population have resulted in an increase in resource consumption and the consequent generation of large amounts of waste. This generation of waste reflects a loss of materials and energy and imposes economic and environmental costs on society for its collection, management, and disposal. Of the 17 sustainable development goals of the United Nations, four are directly or partially related to waste management such as food waste, recycling, global carbon emissions, and the use of plastics. Traditional waste management options are chosen based on affordability, technical feasibility, and aesthetics. These options lack a holistic approach covering the whole chain of product design, raw material extraction, production, consumption, recycling, and waste management. Further, current waste management practices do not fully evaluate the ancillary human health and environmental impacts and the environmental equity of the chosen options. The recent detection of forever chemicals (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS) in waste threatens to disrupt most of the current waste management options. Although zero waste is an ambitious goal for many communities, currently, there is little evidence of decoupling of affluence and waste generation."

We explore theories and analytical frameworks from political science, public policy, and Chinese studies. We use these theoretical and analytical lenses to analyze ongoing and historical climate policy cases. This course helps students understand the institutions and key actors that influence climate policymaking and apply this knowledge to current cases. The first unit of the course focuses on the ideas of environmental issues. It explores the concepts behind climate politics, the economic and social factors that influence Chinese views about climate issues, and the governing systems that shape the distribution of resources and power in the climate policymaking process. The second unit examines the key actors and institutions involved in climate policymaking. It investigates how institutional incentives and governing structures shape key actors' involvement in the climate policy process. The third unit focuses on non-state actors, including environmental non-governmental organizations, expert communities, and international organizations. It examines the opportunities and challenges that non-state actors have encountered in the climate policymaking process. Each class begins with a discussion of the conceptual frameworks, which are then applied to explain ongoing cases, including those related to climate change. The goal of the discussions is to understand how theoretical and analytical frameworks can apply to case studies and how to choose a feasible framework to understand the political dynamics of Chinese climate policymaking and China's climate ambitions internationally and domestically."

A single volcanic eruption off Tonga increased global atmospheric water vapor (our most abundant greenhouse gas) by five percent. Water became a weapon in the Ukrainian war. Insurance companies began pulling out of covering wildfire insurance as forests dried in the western United States, while updated flood insurance premiums skyrocketed nationally. All rainwater was discovered to contain dangerous levels of forever chemicals. Devastating floods submerged one-third of Pakistan underwater. And the United States, for the first time, declared water a national security priority. This course examines how rapid transformations in earth's hydrological cycle will transform humanity's relationship to its most precious resource in the decades to come. We start with an overview of the centrality of water to climate change, the orphaned status of water in climate policy and climate talks, the systemic problems that have produced this disconnect, the incentives that sustain it, and the conflicts that result. We then spend each class looking at a specific water development from the past five years that serve as the context for shaping our understanding of the social, political, environmental, and security dimensions of our changing water cycle. In the final stage of the course, students critique or devise novel interventions to emerging water problems using systems thinking, scenario planning, and stakeholder-centered design."

The fourth industrial revolution, a fusion of cutting-edge technologies (for example, blockchain, artificial intelligence [AI], metaverse, internet-of-things, hyper-automation, digital twins, and big data) is blurring the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds. Thanks to the great accelerator of the COVID-19 pandemic, digitalization is increasingly ubiquitous in our daily life, defining how we work and radically disrupting how we do business. But such digital transformation carries its own risks and opportunities. The World Economic Forum estimates that digital technologies have the potential to save up to 20 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Yet, the rapid proliferation of digitalization has far-reaching negative impacts on the environment and society. The ever-growing carbon footprint of the digital sector (for example, hardware, software, networks, and data centers) is now larger than that of the aviation one. Similarly, the digital era has introduced a new wave of societal and ethical concerns arising from the adoption of such technologies. Further understanding of such risks is imperative to make digitalization sustainable in the future. This course introduces students to the sustainability challenges associated with digital technologies. We explore the environmentally and socially responsible use of digital technologies. Course topics include the evaluation of digital carbon footprints, the promise of clean AI, the need for energy-aware computing, the unsustainable role of digital assets (for example, cryptocurrency), the deepening of the digital divide, and the rising tide of climate change disinformation. The course also examines the taxonomy of digital justice, with a focus on ethical issues of emerging technologies. The course draws on case studies and contributions from active practitioners. Throughout the course, students take part in a live learning experience with peer learning opportunities in addition to individual activities."

In a future of climate-driven disasters, there is an even stronger imperative to consider the social, economic, and political frameworks that give rise to the conditions which presage disaster. Given that climate-driven disasters will invariably fall harder on the global south, we also face a rising moral imperative to consider how disaster prevention and response can either perpetuate or ameliorate longstanding issues of climate justice. The course begins with an overview of traditional top-down international disaster response frameworks beginning in the mid-twentieth century and charts the evolution of more grassroots, community-driven models. Students are asked to identify an issue of resilience or potential disaster from within their own communities and develop a speculative approach for its resolution. Students are asked to interview and liaise with individuals, groups, and businesses local to their community; diagram community dynamics; and crowd-source ideas for a more livable future. Students then work either on their own or in teams and extrapolate lessons learned in their own communities into a wider proposal for a new model for global disaster response, rooted in community-based practice."

These efforts, often driven by grassroots activism, offer valuable lessons for transforming the places we live. This course focuses on the unique ways in which US cities are working to mitigate and adapt to climate change while creating equitable and livable communities in the process. Four main themes and twelve case studies show how US cities are reclaiming their streets from cars, restoring watersheds, growing forests, and adapting shorelines to improve people's lives while addressing our changing climate. The course relates national models to field study in Boston and Cambridge, where we meet with local advocates, community groups, government officials, scientists, and urban designers. Students walk the Rose Kennedy Greenway and visit the site of the Big Dig to learn how Boston buried an interstate highway and built a world-class park over it. We ride the region's evolving bike network, featuring paths that are among the best in the country, and meet with city transportation planners to better understand how bike and scooter shares are complimenting public transit. Tours focus on the ways in which Boston's efforts to make its streets safer are also a part of its green infrastructure plans to manage stormwater. We examine Boston's tree canopy, observing how disparities in urban trees correlate to race and income and, subsequently, inequities in exposure to air pollution and extreme heat. We paddle the Charles River and learn about how the Resilient Boston Harbor Plan aims to protect the city from sea-level rise and storm surge by creating green spaces along the city's 75 kilometer shoreline. Class assignments engage students in researching, measuring, and engaging in individual and group projects related to the themes of the course. Students examine how they can take action in their daily lives and careers to support efforts in their own communities for emboldening solutions."

How important are hedge funds to investors, regulators, and the public? From both a theoretical and practical perspective, this course is geared to help answer these questions. It surveys the hedge fund industry from its origins in the 1940s, and explores hedge fund strategies including long/short, event-driven, market neutral, relative value, dedicated short-bias, convertible arbitrage, emerging markets, fixed income arbitrage, global macro, managed futures, and multi-sector investing.

In fact, it is a fundamental requirement for success regardless of functional role, place in the organizational hierarchy, or industry sector.

Given this, creativity has become as important as literacy. Whether operating in the corporate, startup, social entrepreneurship, not-for-profit, or public sectors, organizations increasingly need people who understand the creative process; know how to manage, motivate, and engage creative professionals; and can develop an organizational culture that encourages experimentation, considers the inevitable failures as learning opportunities, and enables innovative outcomes. This course focuses on best practices in creativity and innovation, exploring the interplay between creativity, organizational processes and systems, and successful innovation. Throughout the course we explore tools and techniques for fostering individual and group creativity, management practices that foster (or inhibit) innovation, methods for developing and evaluating ideas for new products and services, the business models to execute these ideas, and principles and practices for leading innovation. Using a variety of readings, case examples, discussions, experiential exercises, and a team project, students explore and apply the principles of creativity and innovation."

Expectations for measurable progress of corporate environmental programs addressing natural resources, pollution controls, monitoring ethical supply chains, and expanded training of employees are growing globally. Stakeholder expectations have accelerated the need to monetize these initiatives. However, the lack of standardized methodology and metrics has resulted in confusion within many industries, hindering progress.

It is, therefore, hard to see the connections that would logically be present in managing information about people or objects. This course looks at the data systems in use in museums to explore the relationships that may be present. We include the obvious connections between fundraising and membership to attendance and social media. We also take a deep look at collections management systems to see patterns of giving that may be leveraged if connections were made to other data. We look at this information from the perspective of the museum educator. Assembling information on programs offered, attendance, and evaluations informs current and future programs and ensures their success. However, big data goes beyond bringing information about constituents and visitors together. Digitizing historical collections allows researchers to analyze the information in field notes, specimen records, and the scientific analysis conducted during the field work. Trends can be measured and compared to current data, giving scientists access to information that may be hidden in the paper records. Topics covered include museum data systems, developing an information policy, systems integration, metadata and tagging, and information storage and retrieval."

In the past several decades, exciting new discoveries on the neurobiology of sleep have been facilitated by technologies such as functional neuroimaging and molecular genetics. Nonetheless, sleep remains mysterious and controversial and, remarkably, there still is no generally agreed upon function for this behavioral state that occupies one third of our lives. Importantly, sleep science exemplifies the translational approach in biomedical science whereby human and animal research together continually advance the field of sleep medicine. Following an overview on the physiology and behavioral neuroscience of sleep, students choose a topic related to the effects of sleep on mental health to research in depth, to present to the class, and to discuss in a term paper. Topics might include the characteristic abnormalities in sleep occurring in mood, anxiety, psychotic, addictive, autism spectrum, or neurodegenerative disorders. Such changes are increasingly seen as bidirectional, with sleep disturbances contributing to the waking symptoms of these mental disorders. Other topics might focus on the contribution of primary sleep disorders to psychiatric and neurological illness such as the linkage between sleep apnea and depression, circadian rhythm disorders in bipolar illness, insomnia as a risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders, or contribution of nocturnal seizures to neurodevelopmental disorders. Still other topics may focus on the contribution of normal sleep to emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and human performance factors. For those with more neuroscientific interests, topics might include neuroimaging of cognitive functioning following sleep deprivation or the growing interest in trafficking and disposal of abnormal proteins during sleep having a potential role in neurodegenerative illness."

In examining the impacts of forced migration on cultural production, transmission, and innovation, we put classical theories of refugee and migration studies in conversation with recent ethnographies and folklore collections, as well as memoirs, novels, songs, and films by and about displaced persons. With case studies ranging from colonial Africa, to post-war Europe, to contemporary America, we explore what, if anything, holds together the refugee experience, while also interrogating our own neighborly obligations and scholarly commitments as we navigate what has famously been deemed the century of the migrant."

        "course_description": "More people die every year from opioid overdoses than gunshot wounds and car accidents, and the crisis appears to be worsening and rapidly changing. Making matters worse, understanding the crisis in real time is notoriously difficult, especially since most who overdose do not go to hospitals and death certificates are often unreliable. And while everyone agrees something must be done, what that something is leads us into heated debates over health care spending and harm reduction. While most medical research focuses on the biology of disease, this course takes a biosocial approach to unmask how social factors, economic insecurity, and the availability of massive amounts of pharmaceuticals have become an overdose crisis. We read social scientists, journalists, public health scholars, and first-hand accounts in order to understand the chronic emergencies (such as de-industrialization and despair) behind this acute crisis. By investigating the opioid epidemic in this way, students are encouraged to think boldly and creatively beyond the traditional boundaries of medicine: perhaps someone's best medicine is a housing voucher, or a testing strip to detect fentanyl. By the end of the course, students understand the social roots of the opioid epidemic and how solutions may be implemented."

In particular, much is being learned about Mars and Venus because of the many recent and ongoing space missions. Spectacular data from Jupiter's and Saturn's moons, like Titan, Europa, and Enceladus, show that these moons may become possible targets of future searches for life in our solar system. Geochemists are finding more and more intriguing clues about the Earth's past by analyzing rocks dating from the very first period after the Earth's formation, thus providing a fundamentally new context for research on the transition between chemistry and primordial life. And astronomers have been recently successful in searching for planets around other stars. Searches for extra-solar planets are currently under way and are leading to the discovery of Earth-like planets around solar-type stars."

Often, innovation is left in proof of concept stages and does not see production because of the lack of foundational architectural components necessary for hardened and mature enterprise-grade deployments. This lost innovation translates to lost revenue and missed opportunities. This course helps students to appreciate the power of technology and skillfully apply it in practical situations in the real world. It leverages the Databricks platform on Amazon web services (AWS) to simplify the cluster setup so that students can focus on the data engineering aspects of getting the data ready for analytics."

        "course_description": "Looking at the world around us, we see computers solving problems on incredibly large scales: finding webpages relevant to our internet searches and returning them in sorted order, computing the quickest way to reach a destination given current traffic conditions, and matching people on dating sites. How is this possible? More computing power? Intensive application-specific engineering? While these certainly have had a role to play, in this course, students are exposed to and learn how to use general algorithm design principles that cut across application domains and remain relevant even as computing technology changes. First among these principles is mathematical abstraction, whereby we capture the essence of a computational problem (as well as the notion of what a computer is) so that we can develop and analyze solutions independent of an implementation. Given these mathematical abstractions, we can apply a toolkit of basic algorithmic techniques in the search for solutions and then gain certainty in their correctness and efficiency through rigorous mathematical proofs. Furthermore, the powerful concept of reductions allows us to identify relationships between computational problems that seem very different on the surface and thus automatically transfer solutions from one to another. At the same time, some important computational problems have defied the search for algorithmic solutions. Computer scientists would love to have debugging tools that determine whether their programs can crash, natural scientists would love to have simulators that quickly determine the energy-minimizing states of physical or biological systems, and university registrars would love to be able to automatically schedule classes in a way that optimally maximizes the use of the best classrooms. Why have no scalable algorithms been found for these problems? In the last part of the course, students learn that many important computational problems are inherently unsolvable\u2014they have no general algorithmic solution whatsoever. Others are solvable, but have no efficient algorithm\u2014the minimum computation time inherently grows exponentially with the size of the problem instance. Uncovering these phenomena (known as uncomputability and intractability, respectively) are unique benefits of a mathematically rigorous approach to algorithms. While we may sometimes be satisfied with empirical demonstrations of the performance of an algorithm we have found, a proof seems to be the only way to convince ourselves that there is no algorithm whatsoever. This course aims to give students the power of using mathematical abstraction and rigorous proof to understand computation. Thus equipped, students are able to design and use algorithms that apply to a wide variety of computational problems with confidence about their correctness and efficiency, as well as recognize when a problem may have no algorithmic solution. At the same time, students may gain an appreciation for the beautiful mathematical theory of computation that is independent of (indeed, predates) the technology on which it is implemented."

Regardless of the option you choose to build the site, a solid planning process is crucial to produce an effective site. Questions such as what is significant about the product, for whom the product exists, and how should the product information be organized need to be addressed upfront. In this course, students learn to plan and design a website or web application, including choosing a target audience, defining site goals and reconciling these with user and business goals, establishing a brand and a tone of voice, and designing a page architecture. Students select two projects and then create a complete plan for each. These plans can serve as a blueprint for anyone charged with building the corresponding website. This course is not a coding course. It focuses on the other aspects of website and web application creation to set the stage for building better sites that get results."

The economist John Maynard Keynes wrote that, &quot;the ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood.&quot; Economics is not primarily a set of answers, but rather a method of reasoning. By the end of the semester, students are able to use the analysis practiced in the course to form their own judgments about many of the major economic problems faced by the United States and other countries. In the first part of the semester, we focus on microeconomics, which is the study of the interaction of people and firms in markets. Since we live in a market economy, this study helps students to understand how American society organizes its economic affairs. We examine how the forces of supply and demand operate in the markets for goods and services. Students learn powerful tools that enable them to understand a great deal about the economy and how it works. Using these tools, we develop a framework to evaluate social policies. Trade\u2014always a controversial subject\u2014is analyzed, along with measures, such as tariffs, designed to restrict trade. Theories concerning firm behavior are then examined\u2014how companies decide how much to produce, and the profits which result. During the second half of the semester, we focus on macroeconomics, the study of the economy as a whole. We study economic growth and development, business cycles, and the impact of both monetary and fiscal policy on inflation, unemployment, interest rates, investment, the exchange rate, and international trade.

In the microeconomic portion of the course, we examine exactly how prices are determined in competitive markets and what can distort that determination. Market structure is analyzed, including the fundamentals of firm pricing and production decisions. Using examples from various industries, we analyze what happens when market conditions change. Furthermore, we examine how these changes affect overall social welfare. Issues concerning trade are addressed, for example, when should countries, or even individuals, trade? Who gains or loses from trade? Turning to macroeconomics, we investigate the key economic statistics that you read about in the business press and other media, such as gross domestic product (GDP), the consumer price index (CPI), and the unemployment rate. For so many around the world, economic development is literally a matter of life and death. While economic growth is primarily a long-run phenomenon, short-run fluctuations in the economy\u2014cycles of expansion and recession\u2014are often the focus of short-run planning decisions by consumers, firms, and government. We examine in detail what causes these fluctuations and how government policies\u2014monetary and fiscal policy\u2014can dampen these cycles. An understanding of the Federal Reserve and monetary policy must be predicated on an understanding of the banking and financial system. Therefore, we delve into that in the course of our study of actions by the monetary authority. Recent events have also thrust fiscal policy to the fore. We talk in detail about how fiscal policy works and its implications for the economy in both the short and long term. Economics is not primarily a set of answers, but rather a method of reasoning. By the end of the course, students are able to use the framework they have learned to form their own judgments about the major economic problems faced by the United States and other countries. Indeed, after completing the course, students often find that they are better able to read and interpret the business press and other media and are better equipped to evaluate the economic policies promulgated by governments and other institutions.

The focus is on understanding the way the economy works in the real world in contrast to conventional economics, which relies excessively on assumptions, theorizing, and abstract models of the economy. We apply the concepts we learn to contemporary controversial topics such as minimum wage legislation, the function of unions, and why the free market overcharges for healthcare. We explore why Noble Prize-winning economists such as Paul Krugman and Joe Stiglitz are so critical of the current economic situation for its dizzying inequality, its endemic underemployment, humongous trade and government deficits, stagnating wages, and lack of inclusive growth that is unable to provide a dignified life for so many millions of its citizens. Mainstream economists do not have the answers to the challenges of globalization, inequality, and technological unemployment because they are unable to think creatively about new institutional structures that would enable us to transition to a full-employment, high quality-of-life economy in which the focus is not on production and consumption, but the achievement of a high quality of life. In contrast, this course weaves ideas from history, psychology, sociology, and political science into a common-sense economic perspective in order to explore these issues. We also discuss the achievements of Nobel Prize-winning behavioral economists and the impact of the financial crisis of 2008, the economic roots of the rise of populism, and the main impact of the COVID-19 pandemic."

Focusing on three kinds of breakdown\u2014aesthetic decadence, aristocratic degeneration, and imperial decline\u2014our course links popular texts like <i>Dracula</i> (1897), <i>Brideshead Revisited</i> (1945), and <i>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</i> (1974) to the emergence of a new kind of British power based on myth and nostalgia. We also think about decline as a shaper of modernism, the political power of decline, and the cultural afterlives of the texts we encounter."

Supply chain emissions are frequently the largest overall source of an organization's GHG emissions and are becoming an increasingly relevant topic as more companies outsource manufacturing, logistics, and other key functions to third parties. Waste, water use, and GHG emissions are still incurred in bringing products and services to consumers, but they are often not fully accounted for. Proper accounting for these emissions that are known contributors to climate change is coming under increasing scrutiny through major disclosure initiatives including the US Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) and European commissions such as the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG). Students investigate how to gather data from disparate sources, how to calculate or estimate emissions, and how the procurement of supplies, services, and travel can be managed to mitigate or even reduce indirect emissions. The course also familiarizes students with leading measurement and goal setting standards (the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the Climate Registry, Science Based Targets, and the Carbon Disclosure Project or CDP) and investigates indirect emissions reduction efforts that are underway at several leading Fortune 500 companies as well as universities, municipalities, and government agencies."

However, urban life is currently far from sustainable due to inequality, poverty, poor air quality, high risk of natural disasters and climate change, and lack of access to energy, water, and waste treatment. Faced with these challenges, member countries of the United Nations adopted in 2015 an agenda for 2030, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), with one of these goals focused on &quot;making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.&quot; Therefore, the future of urban societies, and thus of most of the world's population, depends on our ability to design, build, and run cities in a sustainable manner. This course aims at contributing to this goal by surveying the scientific principles of sustainability at the urban level, exploring cities and their metabolism as systems of systems. It covers the main challenges that cities of every size are facing: governance, inclusive urban economic development, national/regional development planning, safety, citizen participation, risk and vulnerability reduction, air quality, resource efficiency, and access to universal basic services, housing, and infrastructures. By paying attention to the contextual factors in which these challenges play out for different types of cities, students not only gain a general understanding of the key dimensions of urban sustainability, but they also learn fundamental governance aspects in cities, such as the need to create partnerships and establish radical collaborations between diverse stakeholders to foster urban transformations."

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that 10-12 percent of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are due to agriculture. Agriculture is also tied to ecological degradation including deforestation, depletion and contamination of water and soil resources, and chemical pollution. However, many individuals and organizations are discovering innovative and tailored solutions to these problems. Addressing the ecological and climate change challenges of agriculture in the next ten years will be essential to ensure a meaningful reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and to creating resilient production systems. This course provides a broad introduction to the underlying biology and ecology of crop and animal agricultural production systems. We explore how different production techniques including conventional, organic, and regenerative, operate in both a dryland and irrigated setting. Students in this course gain a greater understanding of the realities that agricultural producers must face every day in their quest to feed themselves and the world. The goal of this course is to equip students with a basic understanding of the ecology of agricultural systems, gain applicable vocabulary and concepts related to agriculture, and an understanding of the challenges and opportunities farmers face when seeking sustainable solutions.

Solutions critically rest on fundamental concepts and principles in ecology. This course adopts an unusual, holistic approach by embedding understanding and integration of these principles through a series of ecosystem case studies focused on desert, savanna, and mountain ecosystems; wetlands and other aquatic systems; boreal, temperate, and tropical forests; and agroecosystems. These ecosystems and specific sites exemplify different challenges but similar ecological processes at work for successful management, whether the goal is protection of natural systems and biodiversity, ecological restoration, or maintaining ecosystem services in agricultural and other human-dominated landscapes. Through this approach, the fundamental topics covered in typical ecology courses are exemplified. The historical, evolutionary, and ecological processes determining the distribution of ecosystems, habitats, and species are introduced. Evolutionary processes responsible for the adaptations of individuals are examined to understand the diversity of species and their features. Ecological processes of competition, predation, disease, and mutualism help explain the functioning of biological communities and larger ecosystems. Among other activities, teams of students conduct background research on specific ecosystem sites to understand the ecological, economic, sociocultural, and multistakeholder context of sustainability challenges and integrated solutions."

Likewise, the circular economy seeks to maintain the value and preserve the stocks of materials, components, and goods, while eliminating waste and pollution and restoring natural capital. The circular economy allows for a better economic and ecological performance than today's prevailing economy\u2014which follows a take-make-waste linear model that destroys value, depletes stocks, and degrades living systems. The transition to a circular economy is mandated by the ecological and physical boundaries of our planet. Without an accelerated transition it will be impossible to meet the Paris Agreement targets. At the same time, the transition to a circular economy is a tremendous opportunity that would unleash global economic growth and create an estimated 95 million new jobs worldwide while also boosting economic resilience.

Protecting and sensitively managing the world's lands and waters strongly influences the future richness of global biodiversity, the economic future of rural and indigenous communities, and the trajectory of future global climate change. The course covers the global origins and growth of land conservation tools and strategies and their relationship to other social movements, including climate action, democratic and multilateral institutions, and environmental justice. We use case studies from the instructors' decades of experience as conservation leaders and practitioners and a global network of guest lecturers practicing in different settings around the world to examine the advantages and limitations of a comprehensive range of land conservation tools and strategies. These include, but are not limited to, direct government action, including two national parks; private lands conservation, including conservation easements and other private lands protection agreements used around the world; strategic conservation planning, including creating ecosystem- and large landscape-scale protected areas; land conservation as part of global carbon credit and offset programs and the emergence of biodiversity credit methodologies; and the growth of community-based conservation. These tools and strategies are presented in the context of the effectiveness of nature-based solutions to advance both climate change mitigation and adaptation. The field component of the course allows students to learn through experiential work done directly with a conservation organization, improving their understanding of how conservation strategies are deployed in the field. As examples, students may develop a management plan for a public or private conservation property or assist a land trust with fulfilling its conservation easement monitoring obligations.

In this course, with one eye on current events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Biden administration's focus on infrastructure), we focus on the sustainability of transportation. We examine the interplay of transportation and the structure of society, including topics such as the economy, the environment, land use, politics, technology, and history. Changes now occurring on the national and global levels, such as those wrought by the pandemic and by the rising movement for social justice, are explored through lectures, readings, and student work. From a sustainability perspective, the nexus of energy consumption, vehicle emissions, climate change, habitat loss or alteration, and air quality are explored to understand the impacts of various forms of transportation and the potential utilization of emerging technologies and new policies and institutional structures to dramatically improve results. Looking beyond current practices, we also explore how more fundamental shifts, such as in consumer habits, are reshaping transportation networks and the infrastructure barriers that we must address. Finally, we examine the role of legal and regulatory actions on transportation/environmental relationships at the state and federal levels, and how future standards could be utilized to advance sustainability."

The course begins with an overview of theory and research on community empowerment and a review of successful sustainability initiatives. Then, utilizing an experiential act-to-learn model (rather than a traditional learn-to-act approach), students are assigned to teams and paired with external sustainability practitioners (for example, change leaders working on social justice, climate, education, infrastructure, or health initiatives). Students learn community engagement skills and praxis (creating space for reflection and collective action) with practitioners' target community beneficiaries. After engaging with beneficiaries, students provide partners with a clearer picture of the community's needs and collaborate to co-create an updated community-centric theory of change and a draft a proposed community-led project charter. Throughout the course, students learn practical skills and tools associated with community empowerment and local leadership development. Students also learn and practice reflective coaching and engage in weekly coaching sessions."

        "course_name": "Designing Sustainability Research",
        "course_description": "Research projects in sustainability are complex and transcend the boundaries of conventional disciplines such as economics, international relations, and sociology. Sustainability and carbon issues affect and interact with monetary stability, industrial policy, and more; comprise different analytical foci, including human behavior, politics, and power conflicts; and operate across multiple units of analysis such as individuals, groups, organizations, states, and relationships between states. Research designs must integrate distinct components coherently and logically to adequately capture this multidimensionality. A good research project has both good ideas and good design. While good ideas can be hard to pin down, a longstanding set of rules and design principles can help us turn compelling ideas into excellent research. Good design makes ideas more accessible, persuasive, and likely to achieve their aims. This course provides students with the fundamental principles for designing research projects in the sustainability field, including how to link empirical data to concepts, concepts to theory, and theory to research strategy. This includes articulating a problem, question, or research puzzle and providing a rationale for it; reviewing the relevant literature; advancing a hypothesis or argument; constructing a theoretical framework; defining concepts, variables, and relationships; and designing a test of the hypothesis or argument. Once students learn the principles of research design, their reading and comprehension of even the densest academic writing will improve. When one knows what to expect from the research design of an article, report, or book one is better able to distinguish the argument from the evidence, the logic from the information, and the normative issues (that is, what should be done) from underlying and wider practical and theoretical implications. We explore current issues in sustainability research through a number of cases that bring the full array of research design, including cross-sectional, longitudinal, and comparative designs. The particular order in which these designs are introduced throughout the course follows a cumulative rationale (that is, starting with most descriptive designs to most deductive designs). While the methodological focus is on qualitative approaches, we also look at nested designs, deploying qualitative and quantitative analytical tools simultaneously. This involves hands-on practice. By drafting a research design for a sustainability project, justifying their strategy, and examining their work for potential flaws, students' research critical thinking improves. At the same time, students gain further insights through peer and diagnostic review processes and illustrations of common research designs in sustainability studies."

We are experiencing the stark challenge of shifting the cultural and economic drivers of unsustainable patterns of living on the land at a time of a deep ideological divide in our democratic institutions. This divide is interfering with the ability of our elected leaders to develop long-term, systemic strategies for change. On the other hand, we have a better societal understanding of the risks of failing to address the unsustainability of the ways that humans are currently living on our planet. In response, local, state, tribal, and national-level leaders are open to new policy approaches, giving rise to the opportunity for environmental professionals to participate in the development of improved systems. In this course, we explore the ways that the United States has made important progress in addressing many environmental problems through its laws and policies. However, this exploration also reveals that those solutions have tended to exist in isolation, not addressing or perhaps masking larger system declines that we can see in the form of climate change, loss of biodiversity, inequitable allocation of the benefits and burdens of environmental degradation, and permanent disruption to the ability of the land, air, and water to regenerate. The fact that these trends are not abating in response to the strategies employed over the past fifty years of the modern American environmental movement suggests a need to explore what has worked, what has not worked, and how we view our current challenges through an ecological lens in order to adjust our strategy in response to that knowledge. Students in this course explore the major areas of US environmental and natural resources law and policy, with a focus on the areas of water quality and quantity, biodiversity, hazardous waste and toxic substances, and land use. Students review examples that demonstrate the interplay of local, state, tribal, and federal governmental decision-making processes. In addition, students gain experience in reading case law, statutes, and regulations, as well as policy analyses. Finally, students are invited to bring their own personal and professional experiences to bear as we explore the importance of collaboration and interdisciplinary thinking to solve complex environmental issues."

Both the practitioner and policymaker must be able to evaluate scientific research, recognizing fundamental pitfalls in research design data interpretation, and contextual relevance. Computational modeling tools have allowed for more dynamic and accurate predictions of complex environmental and ecological systems, though simulation output is only as valid as the quality of the input data. Analyzing the integrity of measurement scenarios is critical; what omissions and limitations might bias an outcome, and how might human behavioral interactions cause scenario modeling to differ from quantitative predictions? To learn these skills, students enrolled in this course conduct practical exercises illustrating a range of measurement and modeling techniques, including statistical analysis of ecological and environmental data and system dynamics modeling. Building on these methods, skill development also includes scientific writing, critiquing primary research literature, negotiating environmental resource rights, and accurately communicating environmental science in non-technical language. Course activities are rooted in core issues of environmental and sustainability sciences\u2014climate change, human population dynamics, population viability analysis of endangered species, economic appraisal of projects that impact natural resources, impacts of built and natural environments on human health, and climate justice.

Democracy has come to many different lands in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries, but its record of success once there has been remarkably variable. Consequently, we ask two interrelated questions, drawing upon both theoretical literature and case studies: what conditions are propitious or deleterious for democratic consolidation? And, in the latter instance, are there ways of overcoming less than ideal starting points? Posing these questions requires distinguishing between the process of democratization and the outcome of a stable, well-functioning democratic regime. In doing so, we examine problematic cases, historic and contemporary, where democracy has survived and thrived despite the initial odds (India, Germany). We also look at democratic reversals, where hopes of competitive elections and representative governance have been thwarted (Russia). The point of doing so is to have students think critically about democratic theory and regime change in order to assess events such as the Arab Spring and evaluate what factors are unfavorable to democracy (and why), as well as whether these might be overcome through institutional design or other means."

According to recent projections, Africa will account for more than half of global population growth in the coming decades, doubling its current population of 1.2 billion people by the year 2050. With rapid urbanization across the continent, Africa is primed to become a key player in the global economic order and the center of the world's urban megalopolises. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to wide-ranging issues that shape contemporary politics in Africa. To understand the complexity of cultures and dynamic social structures, the nature and development of political systems on the continent, Africa's place in the geopolitical arena, and the economic prospects for individual nations and the continent as a whole, we critically explore issues related to group identity and social cohesion, examine pre-colonial structures, European colonialism and imperialism, and legacies of colonialism, and evaluate how post-colonial states have grappled with democratization, nation-building, political violence, conflict, and security issues. The following guiding questions frame our study of African politics: how has Africa been shaped by colonialism and its legacies? What factors drive economic growth and development on the continent? What accounts for the relatively high levels of political violence in some African states? What are the socioeconomic and political prospects for shaping Africa's future? To answer these questions, we examine broad patterns across the continent and consider the political, economic, and social contexts in individual countries. Key thematic areas that are the foundation for this course are pre-colonial political structures; European colonialism and imperialism; nationalism and decolonization; race and ethnic identity; gender politics in Africa; neocolonialism and African economy; ethnic conflict and violence; post-conflict reconstruction; democratization; transitional justice in Africa; Africa in the geopolitical arena; diaspora and transnational solidarity; and economic dimensions of African politics. This course draws from different academic disciplines, including political science, economics, anthropology, sociology, and history."

This course begins by looking at the history of the term and its theoretical underpinnings, distinguishing it from related but nevertheless distinct forms of persuasive speech (for example, advertising, op-eds, and polemics) and obvious misinformation. Next, we examine various examples of propaganda and their manifestations, both historical as well as more contemporaneous (for example, World War I and World War II, Russian and Chinese troll farms, and the 2021 United States Capitol riot).

The deployment of nuclear weapons by superpowers during the cold war created a system of deterrence and their potential for mass destruction remains a major concern for international security to this day. In this course, we explore the history and evolution of nuclear weapons, the strategic and political implications of nuclear deterrence, and current efforts to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons. The course begina with a brief history of the development of nuclear weapons, including the Manhattan Project and the events leading up to their deployment during World War II. We also examine the cold war arms race, including the strategy of mutual assured destruction (MAD), and the impact of nuclear weapons on international relations. Next, we focus on the political and strategic implications of nuclear deterrence. We explore the ways in which nuclear weapons have influenced state behavior, including their role in preventing major wars between nuclear-armed states. We also examine the impact of nuclear weapons on regional and global security, including the potential for nuclear escalation and the spread of nuclear weapons to other states. The course examines in particular the evolving relation between the United States and the Russian Federation, the expanding nuclear arsenal of China, the North Korea threat, and the proliferation risks of Iran. We also discuss possible escalation risks between India and Pakistan and explore how Taiwan and Ukraine might both lead to dangerous confrontations among major nuclear players. In addition to discussing the historical and political aspects of nuclear weapons, the course also examines current efforts to reduce and eliminate them. This includes a discussion of arms control and disarmament negotiations, such as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), as well as non-proliferation efforts aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to new states. Throughout the course, we also consider the ethical and moral dimensions of nuclear weapons, including the debate over just war theory and the humanitarian consequences of their use. This includes an examination of the arguments for and against nuclear deterrence and the role of civil society in shaping public opinion on nuclear weapons."

Deterrence theory has evolved considerably and scholars continue to probe difficult questions that remain unanswered regarding deterrence. This course examines the foundational concepts of deterrence theory and how that theory has evolved over the years. In addition, we consider the application of deterrence to international security through case studies in the cold war and post-cold war years. Finally, we assess current nuclear arsenals and strategy along with the role deterrence continues to play in the future of nuclear weapons, as well as application of deterrence theory to non-nuclear strategic weapons (including cyber and economic tools)."

By 1900 recognition of his achievement attracted an international group of painters like \u00c9douard Manet, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, John Singer Sargent, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso. This interest persists among artists today, who respond now to Vel\u00e1zquez in video and film, sculpture, and photography. In this development, one Vel\u00e1zquez work has emerged to command sustained attention: <i>Las Meninas</i>. Created in 1656, it first went on public view when the Prado opened in 1819. Its size (10 1/2 by 9 feet) conveys importance, but its composition, technical virtuosity, and magisterial space give iconic grandeur. Unsurprisingly, interpretations abound. After looking at related works and details of Vel\u00e1zquez's life, this course focuses on <i>Las Meninas</i>. Social issues around portraiture arise quickly, but issues of representation are crucial, especially now. These involve what we do not see but know, as painted space invades real space and the passage of time is implicated. Welcome to the challenges of <i>Las Meninas</i>."

        "course_description": "This year is the one-hundred-fifth anniversary of the end of World War I. Yet, the Great War, as it was called, is often overshadowed by the world war that followed. As a result, few people are aware of the Great War's significance, the legacy of which is still with us. Nor do many people know about the events of that war, such as that one of its first naval battles was fought off the coast of Chile or that the effective deployment of chlorine gas at Ypres led to the suicide of the inventor's wife in Berlin. In this course, we undertake a thematic exploration of the war and its time through feature films, primary sources, and scholarly interpretations. This course seeks to provide the means for analyzing and evaluating what one reads or sees about World War I in regard to historical accuracy and for gaining a broader understanding of different perspectives. Themes include the origins of the war, what made it a world war, the impact of war on soldiers and civilians; the home front; women in war; the war in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa; and post-war issues. Films include <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i>, <i>The Big Parade</i>, <i>Dr. Zhivago</i>, <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>, <i>Mare Nostrum</i>, and <i>Le Grande Illusion</i>."

These have been contradictory enterprises, in which Americans often sought to make other peoples more like them, while at the same time insisting on their difference. This course assesses the meanings and legacies of these projects by examining the ideas, strategies, policies, and outcomes of occupations ranging from the Philippines and Haiti early on to Japan, Germany, and Korea in mid-century to, most recently, Afghanistan and Iraq. The course focuses on American activities and ideas but also examines the responses of the occupied."

The goal of this course is to build a deep understanding of key elements of craft through close reading and textual analysis of the work of master prose writers. We analyze the work of these writers, discussing how they employ structure, character, setting, dialogue, point of view, and other aspects of craft. Students write critically and creatively, both in class and out of class, about the works under discussion and about possible applications to their own creative writing. Students examine the conscious choices about craft that published writers make in order to fully realize a piece of writing."

For as long as we humans have ventured into the ocean, our imaginations have conjured images of serpents, krakens, leviathans, and other creatures, all of whom seem bent on the destruction of those who dare set foot into the sea. Humankind's conviction that sea monsters are real is so powerful that even today rumors abound of sea monsters lurking in the depths. Indeed, every major religion\u2014eastern and western\u2014features sea monsters. Are these declarations true? Do giants roam the deep sea? Did the explorers of centuries ago see creatures from their small wooden boats that we do not see today? During this course we explore sea monsters through a social, spiritual, literary, and scientific lens. We study the sea monsters that flourish on ancient maps to understand the minds of sixteenth century scholars. We examine the bodies of real sea monsters, and consider the world in which such grotesque creatures might evolve. We read tales of creatures from classic and contemporary literature. Most importantly, we develop a better understanding of how humans perceive the world, and how our consciousness can simultaneously embrace our wildest dreams and cower from our greatest fears. Sea monsters, both real and imagined, tell us much about life in the deep sea, and even more about humankind."

Engaging with a diverse range of memoirs, creative nonfiction, life writing, and novels from four continents by physicians, patients (including physician-patients), and concerned individuals, this course helps students interrogate what it means to promote healing and well being in their personal and professional lives. Readings by creative writers, activists, intellectuals, and medical professionals help us think about how we can more effectively address health crises such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease, and how we can better confront end-of-life decisions and care, including the controversies surrounding physician-assisted dying. Through narratives such as Paul Kalanithi's <i>When Breath Becomes Air</i>, Harriet Washington's <i>Medical Apartheid</i>, Anne Fadiman's <i>When the Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down</i>, Meri Nana-Ama Danquah's <i>Willow Weep for Me</i>, and Yan Lianke's <i>Dream of Ding Village</i>, we reflect on different ways in which to become a strong advocate for practices and policies that reduce suffering and promote healing.

Kahlo lived at a time when Soviet politics and French surrealism merged with national agendas that sought to redefine Mexico's identity through the integration of their indigenous heritage. The result was a time of booming creativity in the arts, radical expansion of educational and political agendas, as well as a redefinition of women's identity, sexuality, and the Mexican family. We trace Kahlo's romantic and artistic relationship with Diego Rivera as we learn about the Mexican muralism and graphic arts traditions along with the beauty of Mexican music and popular culture. We also become familiar with the works of some of Kahlo's female artist friends, such as Lola \u00c1lvarez Bravo, Tina Moditti, Aurora Reyes and Mar\u00eda Izquierdo, who gave voice to the voiceless: women, indigenous communities, and the disabled. Finally, we explore topics of Kahlo's representations in media, the commodification of her persona, and how and why she has become a global icon."

We begin by focusing on how you can make the most of these developmental relationships when you are in the learning position (mentee, coachee, or sponsee). We address questions such as: what are the best ways to network so you can build development relationships? Once you are in a meeting with a mentor, coach, or sponsor, what are the right questions to ask them? How do you know when to start or end a developmental relationship? Then, we shift focus and learn how to be an effective mentor, coach, and sponsor to others. We discuss questions such as: how do you give good advice? How do you recognize the type of support that your mentee, coachee, or sponsee needs? How do you evaluate your performance as a mentor, coach, or sponsor? Finally, we discuss how organizational structures affect the extent to which these relationships can be successful. We answer questions such as: when do formalized mentorship or coaching programs work? How should these programs be designed to optimize outcomes? This course is designed to introduce you to different forms of and perspectives on developmental relationships so that you can understand the unique value of different types of developmental relationships in the workplace; learn how to create and make the most of developmental relationships when you are in the learning position; discover how to become a more effective leader by strengthening your mentorship, coaching, and sponsorship skills; and understand how organizational structures can affect developmental relationships within an organization."

        "course_description": "Health care is a large and complex industry. Formulating and executing strategy in the industry requires both an understanding of strategic frameworks and a realization of how those frameworks apply to competitors across health care. While the basis of competition are largely the same in any industry, in many ways health care is different than other industries. In this course, we use the provider-producer-payer golden triangle model to introduce core strategic concepts and analyze how those concepts apply to the industry, all while keeping the patient front and center. This is primarily a case-based course. For most classes, students read an article on a strategic concept or a strategic topic in health care and then prepare a case study that applies that concept or topic to a real-world health care organization. For example, we analyze how Cleveland Clinic has created a sustainable competitive advantage in health care delivery, how Moderna has taken an innovative platform approach to vaccine development, and whether CVS, Walgreens and Walmart will be able to improve primary care through their scale and scope. Underlying the case analyses are core strategic frameworks like Porter's 5 Forces model, disruptive innovation, and Blue Ocean Strategy. For a final project, students have an opportunity to apply course concepts to an organization of their choice in the health care industry."

While the course has its foundations in microeconomics and managerial economics, it does not impose the same restrictive assumptions, which often do not hold in the real world: the equilibrium price is not known, managers cannot be assumed to know their demand function, and companies and competitors are not as rational as the theory portrays. The course allows participants to discover how and when economic concepts can and have been successfully adapted and tailored to make better decisions at real-world companies. The questions to be addressed include: for which companies is demand and supply analysis, one of the most central tools of microeconomics, key and for which companies is it unimportant? How do companies obtain the market demand and supply data to understand and predict market equilibrium prices? How does one obtain information on the company-specific demand curve (assumed to be known in microeconomics) for any existing or new products or services that customers have never seen or experienced? How can microeconomic utility and indifference analysis be applied in the real world to extract customer preferences? And how can that be used to construct future demand and decide upon whether or not to enter or create a market, with what specific product or service, and at what price? Should companies obtain and use price and other elasticities in the real world for better decision making? What are common practices and what are its fallacies? How can they be overcome? How can we use, tweak, and supplement game-theoretic concepts in the real world where its assumptions of perfect information and hyperrationality do not hold? How can that allow managers to make significantly better decisions in areas such as bidding in tenders and auctions, pricing, and market positioning?"

This course introduces the science of a brain (and body) healthy diet and the concepts of the neuropsychology of eating, and offers practical applications of the science that you can adopt to support your own brain health and that of those you care for. It is not just what you eat, but how. Eating mindfully means choosing foods that balance blood sugar and provide adequate levels of brain-boosting nutrients like essential fatty acids, lean proteins, and a rainbow of antioxidants. The nutrients extracted from food enter metabolic pathways that are manipulated, modified, and molded into molecules that the body can use. This nutritional psychiatry course includes opportunities to ask questions of the faculty, experience live cooking demonstrations, and engage with other members of the brain healthy community for inspiration from similarly motivated individuals. When it comes to diet, most people's concerns involve weight loss, fitness, cardiac health, and longevity. But what we eat affects more than our bodies; it also affects our brains. Now more than ever our food is something we can control. Foods can boost our immunity which is also linked to levels of depression and anxiety; studies also show a link to insomnia, dementia and beyond. This course guides students through the principles from Dr. Uma Naidoo's cutting-edge book, <i>This Is Your Brain on Food</i>, Barton Seaver's books <i>American Seafood: Heritage, Culture &amp; Cookery From Sea to Shining Sea</i> and <i>Two If By Sea: Delicious Sustainable Seafood</i>, and National Geographic's <i>Foods for Health: Choose and Use the Very Best Foods for Your Family and Our Planet</i>, and then goes even deeper with professional lessons, resources, recipes and insights. This course also provides action steps and resources to take control of your own brain health, performance, and wellbeing, and to support those you care for and about with every brain-healthy food choice."

        "course_description": "Many of us have good reasons for doing this or that, making this decision rather than that, choosing this path over another. There is often a point to these choices that we can identify and sometimes have thought hard about. But is there a point to life as a whole? That is the question about the meaning of life. Though the question is notoriously hard to make precise, one way or another it has animated much literature and art, and also much philosophy. Some philosophers have provided very disheartening answers to the questions of whether life has meaning, including that life is suffering and then it ends; life is absurd and never gains any meaning; life is all about creating hell for each other and we cannot escape. But other philosophers have provided more uplifting answers. Both kinds of answers deserve serious scrutiny. Such scrutiny should be of interest to anybody who wishes to make reflection on their life as a whole part of their education. After reviewing a number of pessimistic and more optimistic approaches to the meaning of life we also turn to the subject of death. We all die eventually. We normally encounter death among family and friends before we have to deal with our own. These themes too are the subject of philosophical reflection. The course finishes with a discussion of an important set of lectures on the topics of this course by a contemporary philosopher. This course is quite wide-ranging and integrates historical figures and references to art and literature as appropriate, but its main focus is on contributions by relatively recent thinkers in the Anglo-American analytical tradition of philosophy. The methodology of this course is philosophical. Some of the topics may touch you quite personally and you should take this into account before enrolling."

A successful proposal (which is the final product of the fall semester) is an evidence-based academic paper that convinces an audience not only that a strong need for your project exists, but that your project's theory of change (that is, how you plan to take your learners from point A to point B) is rooted in the literature on human development and psychology. As students work on their capstone proposal, they are exposed to a broad range of literature on various topics in human development.

In the past several decades, exciting new discoveries on the neurobiology of sleep have been facilitated by technologies such as functional neuroimaging and molecular genetics. Nonetheless, sleep remains mysterious and controversial and, remarkably, there still is no generally agreed upon function for this behavioral state that occupies one third of our lives. Importantly, sleep science exemplifies the translational approach in biomedical science whereby human and animal research together continually advance the field of sleep medicine. Following an overview on the physiology and behavioral neuroscience of sleep, students choose a topic related to the effects of sleep on mental health to research in depth, to present to the class, and to discuss in a term paper. Topics might include the characteristic abnormalities in sleep occurring in mood, anxiety, psychotic, addictive, autism spectrum, or neurodegenerative disorders. Such changes are increasingly seen as bidirectional, with sleep disturbances contributing to the waking symptoms of these mental disorders. Other topics might focus on the contribution of primary sleep disorders to psychiatric and neurological illness such as the linkage between sleep apnea and depression, circadian rhythm disorders in bipolar illness, insomnia as a risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders, or contribution of nocturnal seizures to neurodevelopmental disorders. Still other topics may focus on the contribution of normal sleep to emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and human performance factors. For those with more neuroscientific interests, topics might include neuroimaging of cognitive functioning following sleep deprivation or the growing interest in trafficking and disposal of abnormal proteins during sleep having a potential role in neurodegenerative illness."

Students gain practical experience by participating directly in a real-world anti-bias intervention and DEI program. Students also learn to apply cutting-edge scientific methods (for example, how to design and conduct a survey or field experiment) that are critical for evaluating the effectiveness of these initiatives. The course culminates in an independent research project in which students propose, develop, and evaluate the effectiveness of an anti-bias or pro-diversity intervention in an organizational setting."

Targets of prejudice often experience interpersonal and institutional discrimination that undermines their psychological well-being and economic mobility. In this course, we critically examine the psychological processes that underpin conscious and unconscious forms of prejudice and stereotyping. We examine the effectiveness of various interventions for reducing bias, considering how and why many people fight back rather than self-improve when confronted with evidence of their own bias or that of others in society. Together we work to develop a scientific understanding of how modern forms of prejudice and discrimination operate in human relations and how to confront biases in the self and others."

Examples include spaceflight; high altitude flights or mountaineering; submersed or underwater activities; and polar, desert, or jungle exploration. In addition to these classical extreme environments, the COVID-19 pandemic placed a large portion of the world's population in an extreme environment defined by social and physical isolation/confinement, movement and travel restrictions, disruption of personal and professional activities, and novel health risks and behavioral adjustments. This course covers the effects of extreme environmental exposures on major physiologic systems and the resulting neurophysiologic and neurobehavioral performance and (re)adaptation. These topics are augmented by contemporary findings from research studies conducted in operational environments and discussed in the context of history, experimental methods, and research paradigms used in extreme environmental physiology and translational neuroscience. We also review current studies emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss them in the context of transition from every day to a new normal extreme environment, including physiologic, behavioral, and social adaptations. Theoretical concepts and research findings are evaluated relative to their utility in developing functional countermeasures for extreme human habitation as well as methods for clinical treatment of related medical conditions in the general population. As such, this course may be particularly interesting to students pursuing careers in translational neuroscience, psychology, extreme physiology/medicine, and human performance in extreme environments. This course features expert guest lecturers (for example, NASA astronauts and researchers, Antarctic expeditionary physicians, and underwater explorers) and demonstrations of unique experimental methodologies and equipment used in isolated, confined, and extreme environments."

We examine creativity from different levels of analysis, including biological, psychological, and social levels. We use three different approaches in our examinations: first, we examine empirical research; second, we employ the case-study approach to learn from the lives of history's most eminent creative achievers; and finally, we use ourselves as subjects to arrive at valuable insights about the creative process. Some of the topics we cover include the definition and measurement of creativity, the nature of the creative process, the creative personality, the role of family life and culture in creativity, the relationship of creativity to IQ, and the relationship of creativity to psychopathology."

As modern medicine racks up victories to ensure healthier and longer lives, a quieter, darker parallel story is emerging in even our finest hospitals: people die anxious and in pain, pursuing long-shot treatments instead of comfort. Why is dying so difficult, and how can we make death a better experience for others, and ultimately ourselves? This course is split into three units. In the first, we focus on cancer, with a close reading of Paul Kalanithi's <i>When Breath Becomes Air</i>. In this unit, we explore notions of identity, hope, and what counts as a good outcome, especially when it is at odds with the healthcare team. In the second, we reflect on mortality, including the badness of death and how death should change the way we live, reading Atul Gawande's <i>Being Mortal</i> and Shelly Kagan's <i>Death</i>.

This course explores the cultural dimensions of social class in the US from an ethnographic perspective, focusing on the everyday lives and cultures of ordinary Americans. We consider questions such as the following: what is it like to be a working class person in a society heavily invested in ideas of individual advancement and meritocracy? How do professionals (the upper middle class) define themselves and how do they view those above and below them in the class structure? How does social class shape people's values, political views, and tastes? How are class boundaries created and maintained? The course readings are drawn mainly from anthropology and sociology.

Our goal is to develop, in collaboration with students, a pedagogy for fostering students' personal quests for wisdom, through lectures and readings, extensive conversation, and other experiences inside and outside of class, including dramaturgical experiences with film or theater, caregiving, and meditation. As teachers we are inspired by William James's conception of knowledge in the university as a strategy needed to live a life of purpose and significance that also contributes to improving the world. In the words of Albert Camus, &quot;Real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present.&quot; Together, we engage with the problems of danger, uncertainty, failure, and suffering that led the founders of the social sciences and humanities to ask fundamental questions about meaning, imagination, aesthetics, social life, and subjective experience. These are the same existential questions that bring ordinary people all over the world, and throughout history, to question common sense reality in the face of catastrophes and the violence of everyday life. The many answers to these questions\u2014wisdom that is found in religious, ethical, and aesthetic quests, expressions, and traditions\u2014are intended to furnish individuals' art of living with strategies to respond to potential and hope, pain and suffering; to promote healing; and to address concerns about salvation, redemption, or other kinds of moral-emotional transformation. Together\u2014through discussions, lectures, films, virtual museum visits, readings, and action\u2014we explore different paths to wisdom, including the youthful quest for truth, beauty, and goodness; the affirmation of caregiving for others as the means of applying wisdom to repair and improve the world; suffering and the ordeal of journeying through labyrinths and tests of courage; the discovery of wisdom in teachers and mentors near and far; and the process of creative mourning for past losses and shaping new beginnings."

We consider questions such as, how do the different kinds of exchanges we engage in\u2014gift exchanges versus market exchanges, for instance\u2014shape our relationships with others? We explore the social meaning of money and the role of the market in our lives. In a world where it is possible to rent a family, does money destroy love and intimacy? What aspects of our lives are governed by the logic of capitalism and what aspects escape capitalism's grip? Why does it feel shameful to be in debt, and how has this shame been manipulated for political purposes? Why in the US do we consider work to be sacred and morally purifying even though many of us have tedious jobs? The course readings include theoretical and empirical works drawn mainly from the fields of anthropology, economic sociology, and heterodox economics.

Our spine-tingling intellectual task in this course is to analyze the roles that these malevolent entities and the supernatural narratives we tell about them play in our everyday lives, collective psyches, communities, and politics, and in the crises we confront as individuals and groups. Are our occult stories allegories of our modern discontents or simply holdovers from our childhood nightmares? Are they symptoms of specific societal crises or representations of timeless pan-human fears? How has the witch hunt, the rumor panic, the standardized nightmare of the group transformed in this meme-ified age of online participatory culture, global interconnection, ecological catastrophe, and fake-news-driven conspiracy thinking? What can we learn about ourselves, our pasts, and our futures by thinking deeply about what scares us the most? And how frightened should we be of what we might find if we dig too deeply into that question? We analyze the supernatural in relationship historical memories, cultural anxieties, folk traditions, spiritual beliefs, physiological sensations, political conflicts, environmental disasters, and existential imperatives. Because nowhere is safe from the things that go bump in the night, our interdisciplinary journey takes us across time and space into the bellies of various beasts, from the gates of Harvard Yard, to the hills of Rwanda, the message boards of 4chan, the proms of rural Pennsylvania, the ships of the Middle Passage, the villages of medieval Europe, the halls of the White House, your creepy neighbor's basement, and the deep dark woods.

Students learn that there are different definitions of the hero in different historical times and places. In the end, though, the one true hero of this course is the <i>logos</i> or word of logical reasoning, as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue in this course requires careful thinking, realized in close reading and reflective writing. The last word about this logos comes from Plato's memories of words spoken in dialogue by Socrates during the last days of his life, which is read towards the very end of the course. Such a last word, shaped by a deep understanding of the idea of the hero in all its varieties throughout the history of Greek civilization, becomes the latest word for students who earnestly engage in dialogue, by way of writing as well as reading, with heroic expressions of the human condition. This course is driven by a sequence of dialogues that lead to such an engagement, guiding the attentive reader through many of the major works of the ancient Greek classics. In this course, all readings (which are freely available via the course website) are translated into contemporary English and supplemented by selections from the ancient visual arts."

How can you turn a wobbly idea into one that works? We then consider character\u2014who does the story belong to? How do their desires, problems, and drives give the story its essential energy? Then we turn to story development and structure, the primary work of the course: how do you keep an idea alive for two-hundred pages, or two hours? What elements help a story build energy and momentum, and deliver us to a satisfying close?

Applications that were infeasible or impractical a few years ago are now in routine production. These advances allow intelligent systems to interact with the real-world using vision. Examples of modern computer vision (CV) applications include digital photography, robotic or autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and scientific imaging. This course is a fast-moving survey of both fundamental theory of CV algorithms along with hands-on practical assignments applying these methods using Python. Successfully deploying CV applications often requires a combination of classical methods and state-of-the-art algorithms. Therefore, this course includes classical image processing and CV techniques which are the basis of many standard CV applications. From this foundation the course moves to the deep learning approaches that have revolutionized computer vision. Students apply tools drawn from the extensive universe of Python CV related packages in the hands-on assignments. Major topics covered in the course include: algorithms used to prepare images, transform images and extract features; statistical properties of images and methods of decomposition; classification of objects in images; optimization and regularization for machine learning algorithms; deep neural networks for image classification; motion in images and optical flow; advanced deep neural network architectures; object detection and tracking algorithms; models of stereo vision; segmentation of images; and generative models."

Students have the chance to choose a topic of interest and apply their understanding of these concepts in a paper and presentation. In this course, students also explore current research that applies these concepts to issues and topics of current interest. For example: how should one evaluate crypto and other new products as investment vehicles? How do large firms with pricing and market power make decisions to maximize profit, and should they face some regulatory limits? How can we take climate change into account in our personal, business, and policy decisions? What about the possibility of another pandemic, and other large unknown risks? What is the role of a person's specific geographic location, including nearby schools, crime rates, jobs, local businesses, and social networks, in maintaining poverty and inequality and what could be done in to improve those outcomes?

When the Fed or the European Central Bank announces a monthly $85 billion securities buying program, how exactly does this money flow through the markets? When the government bails out a major bank, how does this action affect the bank, its competitors, the markets, future perceptions, and the economy at large? How can central banks affect the economy in an environment of zero and even negative interest rates? Should regulation influence the behavior of firms or individuals? Using the 2008 financial crisis and policy responses thereto as a backdrop, we explore how (and whether) the new capital markets created over the past thirty years as a result of greatly increased financial innovation, globalization, and communication are distorting the economic effect of traditional government monetary and/or fiscal influence. The role of important constituents (commercial and investment banks, exchanges, regulators, hedge funds, and government interventions) are reviewed and evaluated for both past performance and future relevance. The course addresses important current topics in both economics and public policy, such as too big to fail, moral hazard, globalization of markets, currency unions, liquidity traps, efficiency of markets, the role of credit rating agencies, shadow banking, regulation of derivatives and hedge funds, Glass-Steagall, and the Volcker Rule. Following deliberations and analysis of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, we then examine the monetary and fiscal policy responses to the pandemic crisis of 2020-2022. Were these policy responses even more extreme? Did central banks overshoot? Were lessons learned from the financial crisis? Was it too much, leading to inflation and too much debt?"

We ascertain recurring historical patterns of financial bubbles without, however, overlooking critical differences. If history repeats itself, why can't we avoid making the same mistakes repeatedly? The great meltdown happened at a time when most mainstream macroeconomists (including the former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke) were writing about how great everything was going since business cycles had vanished for all practical purposes. They were obviously dead wrong. The historical evidence enables us to gain a more thorough understanding of global finance, which influences our lives to such a great extent. Our primary aim is not to concentrate on facts, theorems, or numbers, but rather to see the big picture in a multi-disciplinary and long-run perspective, integrating the knowledge gained from the work of such Nobel Prize-winning behavioral economists as Robert Shiller and Daniel Kahneman. We also explore our current economic situation, including the aftermath of the Wall Street bailouts that forgot to bail out the people on main street and stood by as nine million people were evicted from their homes.

Unsurprisingly, this has led to renewed interest in using games for educational purposes, with various stakeholders in a variety of contexts contributing to the discourse. Educational technology companies and learning and development departments within organizations are particularly influential, armed with newly coined yet somewhat nebulous buzzwords such as gamification. At the same time, there has been a constellation of new and emerging technologies that are not only transforming our understanding of what it means to learn, but also disrupting traditional notions of work. These changes are all further complicated by new and potentially dangerous methods of data capture that influence design decisions to prioritize financial gain over the needs and well being of learners. However, the main puzzle is that while modern schooling has only existed for a few hundred years and various forms of digital edutainment for even less, games and play have served as natural, powerful, and intrinsically motivating learning vehicles for thousands of years. In this project and problem-based course, we strive to resolve these various tensions by viewing games and play as natural literacies that coexist and cooperate within a complex, interconnected ecosystem. We critically evaluate traditional ideas of learning, wrestle with the outlandish claims of companies, and explore alternative pedagogies and their associated measurement methods. While this course draws on foundational research in the learning sciences, we are less interested in debating the particulars of these findings and more interested in distilling and creatively translating them into playful tools for thinking, discovery, reflection, and expression."

The answer to this question is complex. Some of the causes for William Shakespeare's rise to global prominence are historical, like the unique conditions of commercial theater in Shakespeare's day, the eighteenth-century cult of bardolatry and Shakespeare worship, or the intertwinement of Shakespeare with British colonialism. Other causes could be called aesthetic and intrinsic, stemming from the poetic and dramatic qualities which give Shakespeare's plays their lasting power to move and astonish. Still other grounds for Shakespeare's global success lie in the myriad ways actors, writers, and directors from around the world have adapted Shakespeare's plays, combining them with local theatrical and literary traditions.

        "course_description": "This course spans a critical era in American literature, beginning with antebellum and Civil War poetry, entering the twentieth century, and traversing the transformative modernist era. This course begins with the poetry of the American Civil War and the series of major events and social movements that followed it including Reconstruction, the Jim Crow Era, and Manifest Destiny. Encountering such poets as Herman Melville, Julia Ward Howe, Walt Whitman, Edward Arlington Robinson, Paul Laurence Dunbar, James Weldon Johnson, Francis Ellen Watkins Harper, Emma Lazarus, and W.E.B. DuBois, we examine the language of patriotism, pride, violence, loss, and memory inspired by the nation's greatest conflict. As we enter the twentieth century, we encounter modernism, a movement that spanned the decades from the 1910s to the mid-1940s, and whose poetry marked a clear break from past traditions and past forms. We read such poets as Robert Frost, T.S. Eliot, Marianne Moore, Langston Hughes, William Carlos Williams, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Claude McKay, Dorothy Parker, and Wallace Stevens. We study how these poets employed the language of rejection and revolution, of making and remaking, of artistic appropriation and cultural emancipation. Traveling to the homes and workplaces of Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens; to the Poetry Foundation in Chicago, where the institution of American modernism was born; and even exploring the River Thames in the London of Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i>, we see the sites that witnessed and cultivated the rise of American modernism."

Love and work involve choice on the part of the beloved and the worker, and by those bestowing the sought for love and work. The choice almost always involves assessment of the person's identity, which is often defined by terms thought to indicate essential characteristics. These terms have often included the person's race, ethnicity, gender, religion, and language. Differences in these terms between those choosing and those hoping to be chosen can mean inclusion or rejection in the flourishing offered by love and work. The stakes can be as high as life and death when difference plays into a person's trying to become what they are through love and work. The novels in this course\u2014Joseph Conrad's <i>Lord Jim</i>, Zora Neale Hurston's <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i>, Janet Frame's <i>Owls Do Cry</i>, and David Leavitt's <i>The Lost Language of Cranes</i>\u2014range across the twentieth century from the late Victorian era to the 1990s and are set in Africa, New Zealand, the rural American South, and New York City. Differences in race, religion, gender, and sexuality generate the conflicts over who is deemed worthy of love and who is allowed to flourish through work in the worlds these novels depict."

However, regardless of transcendentalism's fame, or how illustrious its members, or how canonical its texts, we have no satisfactory way to define the movement or its achievements. What does it even mean to transcend? Transcend what and to where? In this course, we attempt to figure out what transcendentalism is and why it matters by traversing its theological, historical, and literary contexts. Tracing (or perhaps dissolving) the boundary between human, world, and god, we investigate how intellectual and social revolution happens without distinguishing poetry from science, religion from politics, accident from fate, and perhaps even transcendence from immanence. We ask, among other questions, what are our obligations to ourselves and our neighbors or to animals and plants? Are we bound to respect what violates our conscience? How do we embrace both individualism and collectivism? All said, what do the transcendentalists teach us about rights and responsibilities in our own time?"

But her sparse lyrics are only one of the poetic technologies of looking at, caring for, and mourning the destruction of, the natural world that we explore together: from haiku, to African American poems of exploitative agrarianism and fantastical gardening, to poems that expand the scope of nature from the vast and inhuman to the birdcalls echoing in urban backyards. Through field trips, classroom visits, and conversations with ecologists, scientists, gardeners, farmers and other guest interpreters, this course familiarizes students with a variety of canonical and contemporary American poets: Robert Frost, Jean Toomer, Lorine Niedecker, Gary Snyder, A.R.

        "course_description": "Empirical data demonstrate that the climate is changing and that these changes could produce increasingly serious consequences over the course of this century. This course explores the legal framework in which climate change mitigation and adaptation actions occur and the policy tools available to regulators. We explore several climate change mitigation and adaptation measures in-depth to provide a window into the relationship between legal and policy strategies at the federal, state, and municipal levels, including how these relationships create opportunities and obstacles to climate change action. Students strategize how to develop and implement legally defensible climate change measures that are supported by stakeholders, including drafting implementation and supporting documents. The course begins with a brief introduction to climate change and its projected impacts and then reviews the legal framework of climate change law, including the evolution of climate change related laws in the United States and related litigation. This analysis focuses on the federal level, but also considers the separate authority of states and municipalities to take action. Massachusetts and Boston are the primary case studies for the course. Substantive issues that are addressed include administrative law and the relationship between congressional statutes and agency regulations; the structure of the federal Clean Air Act and history of air regulation in the United States; federalism, particularly the relationship between federal, state, and municipal governments in regulating air pollution; and the judicial review processes. The course applies this legal framework to an in-depth review of specific climate change issues, such as strategies for managing development in flood-prone areas. In this context, the course examines a range of legal and policy tools. At the federal level, for instance, we consider the implications of federal maps that designate flood risk areas without considering projected impacts of climate change and incentives created by federally-subsidized flood insurance. The course then considers strategies for improving regulation and removing obstacles to climate change measures, including through state and local actions, such as revised building codes and zoning laws. We review the process that municipalities often follow in climate change planning, with a focus on the technical and legal challenges that communities need help addressing. Through this analysis students learn about substantive legal issues such as preemption and takings law, procedural aspects of rulemakings, and opportunities for public involvement in policy and regulatory development. In addition to learning about the substantive legal issues covered in the course, students develop or practice legal research skills associated with researching statutes and regulations and interpreting judicial decisions. Students also gain experience with activities relevant to designing and implementing climate change strategies by writing comments on regulations, drafting statutory or regulatory language, and writing corporate climate change statements."

The United Nations has stated that if soil degradation continues, we may only have 60 years of farming left. Loss of topsoil through agricultural practices is a major contributor to water and air quality degradation and biodiversity loss. Replenishing degraded soils may be a critical element in battling burgeoning health crises such as micronutrient deficiencies, obesity, and related diseases. Increasing soil health will also be a critical response to combating and adapting to the climate crisis. Though strong market, political, and social forces perpetuate the status quo, policymakers, agricultural producers, and the general public are taking note and developing, examining, and implementing a wide array of interventions to reverse soil degradation. This course explores the global food system from food production to disposal from the premise that agricultural soil health must underlie any sustainable food system that supports public and planetary health and social equity. We address the current state of agricultural soil health globally and the current and future effects on public and planetary health, including effects on water, air, climate, and nutrition, and social and economic equity. We explore whether adopting sustainable agricultural practices that support and enhance soil health can feed the growing global population while simultaneously buttressing achievement of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Finally, we examine the key interventions put forth to support agricultural soil health, including direct farmer education and subsidies, social movements such as food sovereignty, labeling requirements, corporate initiatives, consumer education, and increased organic waste recycling."

This course takes lessons from the theories and practices of sustainable investment in the professional investment industry and makes them accessible to other disciplines. In every sector and situation, one is increasingly expected to identify, measure, and report material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks. Every investment has implicit ESG factors, because every decision made relies upon humans to buy, make, or do something and employs the rule of law to govern contractual relationships between investor and investee. Investment decisions are made daily for more than US $100 trillion assets under management in the global investment industry and projected to grow to US $145.4 trillion by 2025. This course explores capital allocation decisions more broadly, looking at decisions made every day by governments, companies, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Sustainable investment proactively considers themes and issues such as climate pollution, workplace safety, employee health and wellness, local community relationships, diversity, executive compensation, business ethics, corruption, and new market innovation. We explore critiques of sustainable investment to better understand theory and practice. While some have tried to tarnish what ESG is, and is not, the reality is every investment, business or government today is fast learning how best to integrate all factors, including ESG factors, into their investment decision-making practice. In a multi-polar world with interconnected decision-making processes and consequences, more stakeholders demand greater transparency, customers have expectations of their vendors, reputation and litigation risks are profligate, and regulators seek to reduce negative impacts on society. This course is grounded in industry experience, investment policies and portfolios, and cross-disciplinary academic literature.

But achieving this goal requires much more than an understanding of biology. It requires that we evaluate humanity's place in nature through numerous lenses, including those seemingly far afield from the natural world. This course integrates evolutionary and ecological theory into resource management, economics, sociology, business, psychology, and law to explore conservation strategies, the value of ecosystem services, evidence-based management, and the challenges of decision making under conflicting interests. As this list underscores, conservation biology is inherently interdisciplinary, and this means that each student's training and perspective is integral as we build a comprehensive understanding of this complex discipline."

To this effect, we illustrate the topics with case studies and are joined by guest speakers who are leading practitioners in their domains. In this course, we visit different areas of regenerative opportunity that include regenerative agriculture and permaculture, agroforestry, and large-scale ecosystem restoration; as well as labriculture (in vitro food production) and bio-based materials and products (grown instead of made). In addition to the circular economics framework, we discuss the planetary boundary framework, and look at several large-scale human-Earth models, including National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA). Earth observation, the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain are discussed as technologies to foster, manage, and measure regeneration, both locally and at planetary scale. Other emerging technologies such as synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and geo-engineering are examined with a precautionary, biomimetic, and critical lens."

What are the limits of our understandings and when do we need to bring in others to develop site-specific analysis and strategies? Professionals in the sustainability and global development fields often need to work on or assess agriculture, water, and natural resource conservation projects and supply chains across different geographic, ecological, and agricultural regions. While they do not have to be experts in every situation, they do need to be able to learn quickly about complex natural systems in order to work effectively in teams, provide analysis, and make programmatic decisions. Despite the diversity of these natural systems, there are common processes and mechanisms that underpin and connect all of them. There are key questions one can ask in any situation to learn more. If professionals are familiar with these common ecological and physical processes, then they are capable of quickly adjusting their work to new contexts by asking relevant technical questions, recognizing what they do not yet know, and identifying with whom they should consult. This course is designed to cultivate critical thinking as it relates to natural resources management to help each student understand common processes across natural systems and to develop a set of questions that can guide their future work in any given location. The course covers the core characteristics and management of water, soils, forests, pastures, and agricultural systems and how they are interconnected. Specific topics include water resources, river dynamics, and how natural and human-caused ecosystem disturbance such as fire, logging, and grazing factor into the ecology and succession of forests, grasslands, agriculture, and ecological restoration. Students explore these topics through lectures, individual work, and a team assignment focused on a natural resources management and restoration plan in a location of their choice."

Even as we recognize that human well-being depends on the natural environment, we are experiencing unprecedented environmental challenges largely as a consequence of unsustainable interactions with nature based on linear systems of extraction to waste rather than regeneration. We are increasingly putting our well-being at risk through the unintended environmental consequences of modern life. Industrialization and development at the expense of natural resources, energy- and pollution-intensive food production, and an economic system that fails to account for natural capital: these are just a few examples of how we are failing to work effectively within a socio-ecological system. In this course we explore the evidence for the ways in which the natural environment supports well-being, talk about the implications for sustainability (of what to whom), identify actionable strategies for sustainability that explicitly recognize the coupled human-natural system, and challenge conventional disciplinary norms by integrating social and natural sciences for more effective decision making. We explore themes related to the essentiality of biodiversity to ecosystem services, working with nature, biophilic design, biomimicry, permaculture and multifunctional agricultural landscapes, and collaborative decision making, and identify quantitative approaches for decision making based on systems thinking and dynamics."

Topics include: animal agriculture's impact on climate change, as well as other less well known planetary boundaries like biodiversity loss, nitrogen/phosphorus cycles, water use, and land use; animal agriculture's impact on health, including both communicable and non-communicable diseases; animal agriculture's ethical costs, with a focus on marginalized black and brown populations who disproportionately bear these costs. In the second unit, we turn our attention to the lack of attention on these costs in policy, with a focus on the United States. Here, the topics include: subsidies (highlighting the lack of public investment in alternative proteins, in contrast to the approach taken by other countries like Singapore, Israel, and China); regulation (explaining how factory farms are virtually unregulated due to exemptions and lack of willingness in the US); legislation or proposed legislation (including the Green New Deal, the Biden Plan, and the Paris Agreement). In the third unit, we showcase the vast array of actors who are part of the food systems shift.

During this period new states emerged, disappeared, and re-emerged in the region. Democratic, fascist, and communist regimes were established and dismantled. Economic systems were destroyed and rebuilt. Countries experienced wars, foreign invasions, revolutions and civil wars, state- and nation-building processes, economic and political crises, rapid social and cultural transformations, and modernization. This course examines critical periods in central and east European history and politics: the emergence and experiences of newly restored independent states in the aftermath of the First World War, the devastations of the Second World War and subsequent imposition of communist regimes, their evolution and their rapid and largely unanticipated collapse in 1989, subsequent transitions to democracy and a market economy, the accession to the European Union (EU) and the recent slowdown in economic reforms, democratic backsliding, the largely unexpected authoritarian turn in some of the new EU member states and Russian invasion of Ukraine. The course is designed to provide a general introduction to central and east European politics; survey existing interpretations of social, political and economic developments in the region; and examine these developments within the framework of the contemporary literature in comparative politics."

The Black freedom struggle, or the civil rights movement, encompassed a range of economic, social, and political demands that affected every person living in the United States. This course re-examines parts of the movement that are well known, like Martin Luther King, Jr., or non-violent direct action, as well as lesser-known elements of the movement like sharecroppers in Alabama joining the Communist Party or the role of Black Power advocates in shaping modern America. Together we study the art, literature, music, and history of the movement and how it transformed American society. The course focuses on deepening our knowledge of the civil rights movement through in-depth discussions during class. Each day students have a reading to complete. In class, we read primary sources together and I offer short lectures to help contextualize each class's discussion topics. There is always time for questions. Students do not need any previous study of African American history in order to take this course."

        "course_description": "Despite (and perhaps because of) globalization, the internet, and other features of contemporary life, formal bureaucratic organizations continue to shape the world we live in. Government affairs\u2014both domestic and foreign\u2014are still largely the province of public agencies. Where government services are carried out by contract, as with privatization schemes, they are often implemented by large private organizations with bureaucratic forms (think of Halliburton). In economic affairs, corporations both large and small produce, invest, and consume vast shares of resources. Despite the common image of businesses as small, complex and formalized organizations still do most of the work of the contemporary economy, including finance (think of the various banks now receiving funding from the US government or being nationalized overseas), production of steel and automobiles, and software development (Apple, Microsoft, or Oracle). Billions of humans worldwide organize their faith more or less by worshipping in formally organized churches with hierarchical structures, the best example being the Roman Catholic Church. Educational institutions worldwide and at every level of training are characterized by highly formalized structures, as students at Harvard University doubtless recognize. Bureaucratic organizations are not always large organizations, but they are characterized by formalized rules and regulations, systematic record-keeping and archiving of past decisions, formalized planning for the future, hierarchies of status, defined career paths (within the organization and across organizations), a concern for organizational identity, and other features. Many of these features vary immensely across organizations and there is no single epitome of bureaucratic form. This course has several purposes: to acquaint students with different theories of organization, to learn more about governmental and military organizations in the United States (the executive branch and the American bureaucracy), and to compare different forms of bureaucracy in social, economic, governmental, and military spheres. The course focuses upon government agencies, particularly those at the federal level of government in the United States, but includes powerful lessons for other forms of organization as well. The course aims to provide students with familiarity with several different theoretical approaches and models to studying bureaucratic organizations; a sense of cutting-edge scholarship on bureaucratic politics and organizations; a sound knowledge of the broad parameters of the historical development and operation of bureaucracy in the United States, especially in the military and civilian spheres; and a theoretical and empirical understanding of selected bureaucratic organizations in the history of the United States."

Some of the questions that guide our discussions are: what is grand strategy and what is it for? What are the sources of grand strategy and how are grand strategies formulated? What are the main tools to implement a grand strategy? Should the US engage in an active internationalist strategy or retreat from its international commitments?"

        "course_description": "From the conflict in Yemen pitting the Shi'a Houthis against a Saudi-led coalition, to the civil war in Syria and the Shi'a majority militia-led fight against the remnants of ISIS in Iraq, dominant media narratives portray conflict in today's Middle East as part of a proxy battle between Iran and Saudi Arabia rooted in an ancient dispute within the Muslim world between the Shi'a and Sunni sects of Islam. In this rendering, primordial hatreds are driving religious wars and civil conflict with Iran, at the heart of the so-called Shi'a crescent, and Saudi Arabia, the stalwart of true Sunni identity. However, such simplistic thinking masks over a more complex understanding of the changes occurring in today's Middle East and prevents accurately differentiating between distinct yet overlapping factors such as actual substantive theological and intellectual differences between Shi'a and Sunni Islam, state competition (that is, between Iran and Saudi Arabia), and historical legacies of empire and state building in the Middle East. This course addresses such dominant narratives and challenges conventional understandings of the interplay between religion and politics in the Middle East and how sectarianism, Shi'a Islam, and geopolitical conflict can be more properly understood from a rigorous analytical perspective and focuses on the foundations and varieties of modern Shi'a political thought; religious clerical institutions; Shi'a political parties and militias in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen; and Iran's Islamic revolution, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and the Basij paramilitary organization."

        "course_description": "By 1900, John Singer Sargent (1856-1925) had earned unrivalled international success for his portraits of the cultural elite and the virtuoso glamour of these paintings rightly remains an interest in his art today. But during his career, Sargent created another group of important works that addressed areas other than society portraiture, which also rank as masterpieces. In fact, from the exotic charm of <i>Fum\u00e9e D'ambre Gris</i> in 1880 to the dynamic energy of <i>El Jaleo</i> in 1882, the daring self-assurance of <i>Madame X</i> in 1884, and the performative originality of <i>Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth</i> in 1889, Sargent transformed established subject areas in European painting. He then pursued this original vision in large-scale, permanent forms of expression that began with <i>The History of Religion</i> at the Boston Library in 1895 and continued in the twenty-foot wide World War I painting <i>Gassed</i> in 1919 and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts rotunda in 1921. In this course we look at these works in detail, considering both style and context, to construct a new, richer set of parameters for understanding Sargent's achievement."

        "course_description": "The course is an interpretative look at the characteristic patterns of settlement and attitudes towards cities and urban life that are identified with American urbanization. The course seeks to foster a critical understanding of the national ideals, cultural aspirations, governance, planning policies, and design actions that have influenced American urbanization. Three broad themes weave across the individual lectures. First, the course chronicles the search for alternative ways to form communities, evident in both aspirational and pragmatic efforts to reconceive how and in what shape cities and urban regions should grow. This proceeded originally in concert with a body of ideals that became fundamental to the European enlightenment and soon after the explosion of urban growth brought about by the industrial revolution. Just being built\u2014rather than like European cities needing to adapt, with considerable difficulty, to the cultural, political, and technological transformations of the seventeenth through twentieth centuries\u2014American cities heralded the arrival of the modern world. This is key to their understanding and appreciation. Second, the course addresses the idea of American society being &quot;a volatile mixture of hopeful good and curable bad,&quot; as Michael Kammen put it. We weigh those soaring American aspirations related to liberty, equality, justice, and the desire to perfect the world, against dystopian aspects of American history: the near-total destruction of Indigenous cultures, the horrors of slavery and systemic racism, the conceits of manifest destiny and American exceptionalism, the corporate and political restraints on economic parity, and the despoiling of the environment in the name of progress. The third theme of the course considers the challenges to cities arising from climate change. Given that most American urbanization, indeed most cities around the world, evolved prior to the era of climate change, we face the prospect of having to adapt existing cities and rethink how and where future urbanization should occur. We seek comparisons between periods of rapid urban growth across American history and the even more rapid urbanization currently taking place in regions of the world. American cities grew largely in emulation of and in contrast with their much older European counterparts; today, cities in rapidly modernizing nations seek inspiration from the American urban experience."

From there, we proceed chronologically through American history to the present, exploring changing notions of community, strategies used to gain freedom, and the range of violent responses that groups seeking liberation encountered. Our readings include a play by Suzan Lori-Parks, manifestos by white power advocates, George Schuyler's novel <i>Black No More</i>, essays by Toni Morrison, political speeches, and oral history interviews with formerly enslaved people and migrant workers, among many other historical and literary sources. While race has been an important element to every debate about political representation in American history, most debates represented overlapping interests of race, gender, class, and even sexuality.

        "course_description": "It is irresistible to think that the human race will survive forever despite the many challenges Earth faces. But humanity's most pressing challenges are interconnected and embroil competing interests, thus creating intractable complex systems challenges. These challenges defy simplification. Over the years, reductionist approaches focusing on linear relations failed to provide mitigations for these challenges. Attempts to address these complex challenges must employ integrative logic of systems-oriented thinking. Depth must be balanced with breadth. The goal of this course is to give students an appreciation for the complexity of some of today's most intractable problems, and in so doing, help students understand global challenges and develop methodologies for navigating the world they face. In addition, students are able to think critically on the nature of the challenges faced and propose systems mitigations that may help humanity. This multidisciplinary course is designed to be accessible to students of different backgrounds without mathematical preparations. Students learn foundations and techniques such as complexity, systems maps, design, foresights, and creating human collations. Some pressing challenges such as sustainability, climate change, epidemics, inequality, sociability, human displacement, and the critical materials for civilization are discussed. Through such topics, students critically examine trends and news and participate in discussions that could possibly influence the future of the human race. Students form small networks and groups and use different techniques to propose future-oriented analysis. They practice developing robust frameworks for integrating economic, political, technical, ethical, and social lenses into an analysis of complex problems which would reveal possible unintended consequences and roadblocks that may impede progress."

In many cases, a large amount of textual content is created and stored on a daily basis, only to languish unused in forgotten archives until discarded or forgotten. In the intervening storage period, this content consumes valuable storage space and other resources that may be better utilized for other purposes, while producing no tangible benefit. Given the rapid growth of such content (EMC, a major player in storage, recently estimated that 40 trillion gigabytes of data [40 zettabytes] will have accumulated around the world by the end of 2020), what steps should enterprises take in order to manage and capitalize on it? Is it possible to glean useful, actionable insights from unstructured text, while not wreaking havoc on already strained IT budgets? How should projects intended to utilize this content be organized, and what objectives and success metrics should be established? Even more importantly, how can organizations plan for the future in the face of burgeoning, almost exponential growth in content and complexity? This course discusses approaches to these problems. We first cover the backdrop of today's storage nightmare and how it has evolved over time, then proceed to an assessment of the current state of unstructured content management. Using this background material, students then extrapolate on existing trends and needs for an organization (real or fictional), ultimately producing both short and long term plans of some duration (say, three to five years) for the organization's management and utilization of unstructured content."

Business strategies have to be sensitive to their specific ecosystem and should be tailor-made. Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) are a specific approach to leverage growth and value by redesigning corporate portfolios or by creating a competitive advantage at the business unit level. The dark side of these strategies is that they have significant risk profiles, and they tend to under-deliver on promised synergies and may seriously diminish shareholder value. This course focuses on the strategic and technical challenges of M&amp;A process in the international context and offers a rich toolbox for prospective analysts and managers."

They are also one of the fastest growing and least understood areas in the asset management industry. What exactly are hedge funds? How has the sector developed? What do hedge fund managers strive to capture and how do they do it? What are the major hedge fund strategies and their mechanics? What are their hidden risks and unique limitations? How important are hedge funds to investors, regulators, and the public? From both a theoretical and practical perspective, this course is geared to help answer these questions. It surveys the hedge fund industry from its origins in the 1940s and explores hedge fund strategies including long/short, event-driven, market neutral, relative value, dedicated short-bias, convertible arbitrage, emerging markets, fixed income arbitrage, global macro, managed futures, and multi-sector investing. Students develop an understanding of how hedge fund managers\u2014as well as hedge fund investors\u2014think, operate, and invest. The course tracks a live multi-sector hedge fund portfolio throughout the semester and analyzes current events and price action."

Social media and collaboration technologies provide immediate communication and exchange of information that replaces or supplements the traditional internal and external communication methods. We examine the principles that allow organizations to engage successfully in e-collaboration. We analyze external and internal uses of social media networks for organizations, including refocusing of business strategies and operational processes to incorporate social media communication. We review and access tools that allow team members to communicate with each directly. We also review the tools that allow delayed communication where the members do not all have to be present at the same time, such as enterprise social media networks and team collaboration tools.

This approach to understanding what it means to adapt and to remain flexible extends to almost every profession. To a future practitioner it's creating a mindset that supports diversity of viewpoints by remaining open to new ways of thinking in order to facilitate creativity and innovation. From a macro-perspective, students are made aware of alternative ways of framing change initiatives either as incremental or transformational events within an organization. From this viewpoint they are then able to search for appropriate strategies designed to optimize present and future resources. Over the years management theory has evolved from adopting best practices as a prescriptive approach to solving problems to one that incorporates the latest research in mindfulness as a method for slowing down the process, creating a brief moment of stability, deconstructing the issues, and generating multiple alternatives that address present concerns. A learning experience of this type poses many interesting philosophical perspectives and provides a foundation for better understanding the complex decision-making matrices that drive most organizational dynamics."

You most likely can name someone you admire, someone whose abilities you wish you had. These individuals seem to know how to turn a hopeless situation into an amazing agreement. You may think they were born that way but this is rarely true. In order to be a master negotiator, you must be a master of both the science and the art. You need to have a deep understanding of the basics as well as keen insight into when to create and when to claim value, how to structure a negotiation, and how to address barriers. You should be able to be a master architect in designing your negotiation, long before you ever get to the table. It is imperative that you understand how to bring in new elements, partners, and processes that make up your negotiation campaign. Finally, the proof of your mastery of the science and your entr\u00e9e into the art is when you are faced with a truly complex situation and understand how to put the science of strategy and experience into action. Becoming a master negotiator requires a solid foundation in negotiation concepts; the ability to structure and execute complex negotiations strategically; experience, but an ongoing desire to learn and grow; expertise in set up and design, agility and flexibility; empathy, sensitivity, and creativity; multidimensional thinking and planning; crisis leadership skills; system 2 thinking; and constant mindful practice. This highly interactive course delves into the strategic system 2 thinking and planning that drive success in multiple arenas including multiparty negotiations, international coalitions, and multiphase situations. We explore impossible situations, deadlocked conflicts, and interpersonal, organizational, and international disputes and learn the skills required to address these scenarios. You develop more sophisticated negotiating skills, learn how to avoid the most serious pitfalls, and emerge prepared to conduct a wider range of complex negotiations and resolve conflicts with confidence."

This course focuses on best practices in creativity and innovation, exploring the interplay between creativity, organizational processes and systems, and successful innovation. Throughout the course we explore tools and techniques for fostering individual and group creativity, management practices that foster (or inhibit) innovation, methods for developing and evaluating ideas for new products and services, the business models to execute these ideas, and principles and practices for leading innovation. Using a variety of readings, case examples, discussions, experiential exercises, and a team project, students explore and apply the principles of creativity and innovation."

This course is for students who wish to harness the power of financial markets to create a better world. As the gatekeepers to finance, lenders and investors are responsible for allocating scarce capital to the most promising sectors. Traditionally, master of business administration programs have taught that these promising sectors were those most likely to maximize shareholder value. Other stakeholders, including the government and society, were considered for their nuisance value more than for their intrinsic worth. In the past two decades, however, the notion of blended value investing, that is, investing for both financial and social gain, has gained credence, even among the most cynical of managers. Moreover, it is widely recognized that lenders and investors, as the ultimate financial decision makers, have special responsibilities in this regard. Investing in women through microfinance, gender lens investing, or other instruments also play a special role in this arena. Blended value, which encompasses the social, environmental, and financial performance of a business, only becomes more important in a globalized economy marked by scarce and shrinking resources. In this course, we learn to apply the tools of efficient capital markets including risk/return analysis and cost/benefit analysis to produce both financial and social value. We study various instruments that have been designed to achieve these goals and absorb the lessons learned from success and failure of these early instruments. We consider how best to measure social value and how to balance this against the needs of financial investors in order to optimize financial markets to fund the achievement of the United Nation's sustainable development goals (SDGs)."

Through study of cases of a range of actual crises and of conceptual frameworks for understanding the dynamics of crises, this course takes a managerial perspective on crisis management and emergency preparedness. It focuses both on what responders must do during the critical period of crisis response and on how organizations can prepare themselves for high performance in these situations. It examines how individuals and groups make decisions in crises, identifies the skills and management systems crises demand, considers the differences between managing routine emergencies and crises, and asks how organizations can effectively prepare for crises in advance."

Yet, studies show that most people embarking on their career journey are unclear about what they want and why they want it. They are reluctant, or unable, to advocate for themselves. This can inhibit or derail a career journey, leading to dissatisfaction with roles, responsibilities, pay, and promotion. Ultimately, it can lead to career frustration and burnout. This on-campus, week-long residential course uses a range of interactive exercises, role plays, games, and simulations. These activities engage students in uncovering their interests, priorities, and career directions and goals. Skills development includes strategies for empowerment and self-advocacy, approaches to uncovering sources of negotiation power, and tools to recognize and create career negotiation opportunities. Students engage in exercises to develop and practice their own unique and authentic negotiation voice in order to put their career journey on a path to success and move it forward."

In this course, we explore how objects can illuminate the lives of people often left out of the archive or historical record. From clothing and accessories to food and toys, objects\u2014and the institutions that collect them\u2014provide a material record of how political, economic, and social events shaped the lives of ordinary people. By examining how objects were made, used, and collected, we explore how they open up possibilities for interpreting familiar subjects in new ways and developing exhibitions and programs that are inclusive and accessible to all. This course uses the varied collections across Harvard University to practice methods for analyzing objects, developing strategies for interpretation, and envisioning ways to incorporate them into exhibitions and programs. Prior to our on-campus weekend, we read key works of scholarship on the theories and methods of material culture, the history of museums, and interpretation strategies. Course activities include visits to Harvard's museums and libraries, including the Harvard Art Museums, Harvard Museum of Natural History, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, and Houghton Library. Course activities include object-based analysis, gallery tours, small group workshops, and group discussions. The final assignment invites students to propose how they might interpret objects at Harvard and beyond by drawing on the interdisciplinary methods we practice together."

Their ideas resonate today on a number of fronts that still cause lively debate, among them antisemitism, racism, epidemics, terrorism, suicide, feminism, capital punishment, authoritarianism, and ageism. These writers are also masters of thought and expression. We study their creative works aesthetically and intellectually, and follow their mode of philosophical thinking closely as they develop such concepts as freedom, the absurd, revolt, justice, individual responsibility, ethics, authenticity, committed writing and action, and the appeal to the conscience. Among works to be studied by Camus are <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i>, <i>The Guest</i>, <i>Reflections on the Guillotine</i>, <i>The Plague</i>, and <i>The Fall</i>; by Sartre, <i>Existentialism is a Humanism</i>, <i>No Exit</i>, <i>Anti-Semite and Jew</i>, and <i>What is Literature?</i>; and by Beauvoir, <i>The Second Sex</i>, <i>The Monologue</i>, <i>The Ethics of Ambiguity</i>, and <i>The Coming of Age</i>.

Among other topics, we consider the roles of self-compassion, locus of control, flow, and reframing. We consider the importance of narrative in how we tell our stories to ourselves and to others.

Where have gender biases in assessment, diagnosis, or treatment caused harm? We end by seeking to understand what history can teach us about conducting clinical science in a patriarchal but post-binary world.

In addition to examining the conflicts themselves, we also explore the religious dimensions of the impacts those conflicts have on civic life in areas such as public health, education, and commerce. What roles do religions play in fostering violence and what roles do they play in promoting peace? How do religious institutions and ideologies function to support and/or thwart public health initiatives? What are the ideological justifications for functional economic policies and how do they reflect and/or challenge diverse religious values? What roles do religions play in advancing or suppressing educational opportunities and for whom? Are media representations of the religious dimensions of conflict accurate?

From medieval crusades and inquisition to contemporary terrorism and persecution, the course examines the extreme fringes of politics. It takes us from the horrors of crusades and early modern religious wars to ideological and ethnic violence, the Holocaust and post-cold war mass atrocities. Political violence in the name of race, religion, empire, class, or ethnicity and weaponization of these concepts is examined in historical and comparative perspective. Techniques of its legitimization are given particular attention, including discrimination, stereotyping, scapegoating, dehumanization, and the dissemination of fake news. As they reflect on the roots and causes of extremist politics, students are also asked to reexamine the assets and liabilities of contemporary media and democratic deficit in our world.

Core grammar points such as the use of direct and indirect object pronouns and the difference between <i>ser</i> and <i>estar</i> are also covered."

This course aims to explore the art of creating, maintaining, and protecting a public self. In the first half of the course, we explore the meaning of a public self, with a special emphasis placed on the work of social psychologist Erving Goffman. In the second half, we examine the nuts-and-bolts of managing a public self in a modern media age, with a special emphasis on crisis management."

        "course_description": "If you are sick or hurt, whether you live or die depends not only on biological factors, but social ones: are you wealthy or poor? Do you have a stable home and health insurance? How far away is the closest trauma center or pharmacy? Do people believe your illness is your fault, or even something you deserve? This course explores how social factors create health disparities in the United States. We gain foundational knowledge of key concepts in social medicine, including an overview of health care policy in the United States and the arguments for health as a human right. We then turn to what we can call chronic emergencies: case studies of people and communities who have been denied health care and allowed to suffer and die, because they are poor, uninsured, undocumented, or otherwise social outcasts. Our examples are drawn from across the United States, from the eviction crisis in Milwaukee, to injection drug users in San Francisco, to the people who endure gang violence in Chicago, to the suffering of Mexican migrants in California. We give significant attention to the lived experience of poverty, housing insecurity, addiction, discrimination, and violence. As we encounter these examples, we engage directly with guest speakers from the community. In the final section, we turn from studying how harm falls unevenly to considering how social determinants can be incorporated into action plans; students apply the themes and concepts from the course to explore topics of their own choosing. By the end of the course, students not only have a knowledge of concepts and case studies in social medicine, but also knowledge about how to close the gaps that we study. For premedical students, this course reviews concepts found on the psychological, social, and biological foundations of behavior section of the MCAT, including how sociocultural factors and access to resources have an impact on health."

Emphasizing health as multidimensional, contextual, and socially determined, we explore the history, principles, theories, and frameworks relevant to understanding inequities in health, as well as tools and strategies for advancing justice in health across sectors of civic and community life. We explore how inequity gets under the skin and operates on the body; discuss how racism, oppression, social stratification, and systemic advantages and disadvantages all structure and perpetuate injustice in health; how systems, institutions, and policies influence health. To understand how socio-environmental factors can create pathways to health or disparities, we explore the mechanisms by which poverty, socioeconomic status, education, housing, and the built environment create and sustain inequitable health outcomes in urban communities. Understanding the social conditions people need to be healthy, we turn our attention to approaches for advancing justice in health, with particular attention to root-cause strategies. We explore community development, capacity building, and community mobilization as strategies for building power for health. We discuss health improvement interventions and how community engagement, participatory processes, and cross-sector collaboration can help create and sustain health promoting environments."

Increasingly, it is understood that child health depends on a complex of interrelated factors. Biologic and genetic issues are very important in determining children's health status. Societal, environmental, community, and family factors also play a major role in child health outcomes. We focus on social concerns such as economic status, class, race, and ethnicity. The American Academy of Pediatrics has called out poverty and racism as actual pathogens. We explore the American healthcare system and ask why in the richest country in the world, our child health outcomes are measured near the bottom in comparison with other industrialized nations and our black infant mortality remains twice that of white infant mortality. In light of the recent experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, we pay special attention to the impact of infections on children and compare the US response with that of other countries. We also look at the history of infectious disease outbreaks and the ways that these have been controlled and ultimately prevented. Finally, the course emphasizes the importance of team approaches among people from multiple backgrounds and organizations. Increasingly, we are understanding that if the threats to child health live in the society and community, so do the answers. We discuss strength-based approaches and the shifting of power and agency to families and communities and learn how hope and accentuating the positive are new approaches that are beginning to have success in the promotion of child health."

Fail, and you are left looking for a job. Accordingly, popular politics provides remarkable lessons in compelling leadership and successful management. This course aims to harvest them by way of an analysis of recent presidential campaigns and contemporary politics.

The prototype is the specific product designed to address the real-world problem identified in the fall term proposal. Prototypes can take two different forms. First, they can apply research to design a project in order to solve or address a real-world problem experienced by stakeholders. Second, they may communicate scholarship to specific audiences who would benefit from knowing the information (for example, a publishable article or a website explaining current research to non-academic stakeholders). Projects build on specific interests of each student and are developed in consultation with the instructor. These specialized projects allow students to seek a practical application of existing research on identity, while developing their skills designing research-based practice and engaging stakeholders. The capstone project culminates with a formal presentation of the students' projects."

        "course_description": "The American dream once essentialized the grand promise of a better, fuller, and richer life. At the present moment, however, it seems in many minds to have lost its evocative power as a collective myth. One wonders: does it still represent a principle of hope or has it become a form of cruel optimism? In a time of prolonged political crisis, this course has a pressing mission. It aims to further a dynamic understanding of American dreams (for there are many and not just one), to apprehend their complexities and contradictions, to appreciate their diverse manifestations and historical shapes, and above all to take measure of their presence and meaning in the world we now inhabit. To this end, we study the variety of ways in which feature filmmakers, both in and outside of Hollywood studios, have created designs for living, indeed the most influential and resonant incarnations of American dreams. We analyze popular narratives produced during crucial junctures in the modern history of the United States, from the Great Depression and World War II through the cold war and the McCarthy era, up to the late 1960s. We consider the wide range of functions that these productions have assumed, how they have by turns sustained and questioned the status quo. In some instances they have interrogated, revealed, and even indicted social inequity; at other times they have legitimated injustice and fostered exclusion. The course offers a representative sampling of classical Hollywood features as well as some exemplary independent American releases from 1932 to 1969, including <i>Scarface</i>, <i>King Kong</i>, <i>It Happened One Night</i>, <i>Birthright</i>, <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, <i>Imitation of Life</i>, <i>Casablanca</i>, <i>Cabin in the Sky</i>, <i>Mildred Pierce</i>, <i>The Best Years of Our Lives</i>, <i>Salt of the Earth</i>, <i>The Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i>, <i>Raisin in the Sun</i>, <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>, <i>The Exiles</i>, and <i>Easy Rider</i>."

        "course_description": "Ever since the magical conjurations of Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, fantasy film has been on a meteoric, miraculous rise that has culminated in the first triumphant success and Academy Award for Best Picture for <i>The Return of the King</i> from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy in 2004. These days, big-budget fantasy film releases are not just a huge commercial success, but also regularly achieve critical acclaim for their narrative sophistication, thematic complexity, emotional depth, compelling set design, and gritty realism. In short, fantasy film has become a formidable cultural force both in cinema and on television. No wonder: it is the magic. Marvelous creatures of extraordinary powers abound in this wondrous world: mermaids and monsters, heroes and henchmen, giants and goblins, faeries and fiends, trolls and scrolls, wizards and witches, gremlins and goblins, ogres and dragons, slayers and sorcerers, pixies and nixies, and curses and cures. Why does a tech-savvy and scientifically advanced society like ours revel in myths of miracles and mysteries? Why are we willing to disregard laws of rationality, science, and nature, and abandon ourselves to marvels and magic? Why do we use our high-tech gadgets and digital subscriptions to conjure up medieval and archaic settings? Why does humanity, distinguished by its logos, its language of reason, find mystical incantations so resonant? And why does a society that produces life-saving vaccines in record times, find the power of pixie dust, poisons, and potions so stirring? How are we to explain this phenomenon? In fact, why are we even willing to leave the magic and supernatural in fantasy unexplained? And is fantasy mindless escapism, or is it anchored in an earthbound reality? Is fantasy a flight of fancy, or is it firmly tethered to the ground? Does fantasy offer a respite from humanity's fundamental fears, or does it shed a light on them in order to exorcise them? How is magic so unbelievable, and yet so very real, in fantasy cinema and television? And isn't film itself ultimately a fantasy, an illusion: a trick of the eye, a trompe l'oeil? Now that fantasy film routinely spearheads both Hollywood's blockbuster releases and television successes, and has accrued an enormous and loyal fan base, the mission of this course is threefold. First, we seek to define fantasy film and identify its recurring components, narrative structure, and filmic iconography in both cinema and television. Second, we examine the ways this genre of the timeless, of the mythical, of the archetypal, in fact responds to very acute and specific social and individual needs at a given time. Third, we probe why more than any other film genre, fantasy film\u2014in all its manifestations we are studying\u2014is the most primal. We examine films including: <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> (1933), <i>Lost Horizon</i> (1937), <i>Fantasia</i> (1940), <i>The Thief of Baghdad</i> (1940), <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i> (1946), <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> (1951), <i>Jason and the Argonauts</i> (1963), <i>The Purple Rose of Cairo</i> (1985), <i>Labyrinth</i> (1986), <i>Edward Scissorhands</i> (1990), <i>Pleasantville</i> (1998), <i>Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</i> (2003), <i>Harry Potter: The Prisoner of Azkaban</i> (2004), <i>Pan's Labyrinth</i> (2006), <i>Game of Thrones: Winter is Coming</i> (2011), <i>American Gods</i> (2017), and <i>The Witcher</i> (2019)."
