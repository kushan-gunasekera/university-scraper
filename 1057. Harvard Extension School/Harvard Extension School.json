While most medical research focuses on the biology of disease, this course takes a biosocial approach to unmask how social factors, economic insecurity, and the availability of massive amounts of pharmaceuticals have become an overdose crisis. In the first part of the course, we explore the connection between opioid addiction and crime, especially under conditions of poverty, chaos, and violence. Then, we explore how people search for health care and support when condemned to precarious lives. By investigating the opioid epidemic in this way, students are encouraged to think boldly and creatively beyond the traditional boundaries of medicine; perhaps someone's best medicine is a housing voucher or a testing strip to detect fentanyl. By the end of the course, students understand the social roots of the opioid epidemic and how solutions may be implemented.",

We consider questions such as: how do the different kinds of exchanges we engage in\u2014gift exchanges versus market exchanges, for instance\u2014shape our relationships with others? We explore the social meaning of money and the role of the market in our lives. In a world where it is possible to rent a family, does money destroy love and intimacy? What aspects of our lives are governed by the logic of capitalism and what aspects escape capitalism's grip? Why does it feel shameful to be in debt and how has this shame been manipulated for political purposes? Why in the US do we consider work to be sacred and morally purifying even though many of us have tedious jobs?

However, the last 200 years are not the only period of drastic environmental change in Earth's history. In the 4.5 billion years since forming, Earth has experienced an atmosphere devoid of oxygen, been covered by glaciers, and hosted mass extinctions caused by both increases and decreases in temperature. This course aims to give students a deep-time perspective on Earth's climate, insights into the mechanisms controlling it, and the impacts of those changes. Students get hands-on experience examining and evaluating the supporting evidence during lab activities in addition to reading primary literature. We start by understanding Earth as a system, what the current state of that system is, controlling factors on climate, and how climate changes. The course then focuses on individual periods of dramatic climatic shifts including oxidation of the atmosphere (2.5 billion years ago), global glaciation (720-635 million years ago), sea level drop from global cooling (443 million years ago), massive volcanism (254 and 66 million years ago), asteroid impact (66 million years ago), and the impact of planetary cycles. Understanding the causes and consequences of past climatic events prepares students to better examine the current period of global climate changes and potential futures of Earth. Each class includes time for paper discussion, lectures on new material, and lab activities focused on evaluating evidence. For the final project, students select a policy or regulation that could mitigate the impacts of climate change. They research what the policy aims to address, how it would work, and its potential effectiveness before presenting on the last day of class.

Three major groups of animals are discussed: parasitic protozoa, parasitic helminths, and those arthropods that directly cause disease or act as vectors of various pathogens. Basic types and concepts of animal associations are discussed. Then we investigate the major groups of parasites, followed by the morphology, life cycle, pathology, treatment, and control of these species. We also explore molecular mechanisms in the host-parasite relationship, the influence of parasites on the ecology and evolution of their hosts, the modes of action of chemotherapeutic agents, and strategies for the possible eradication of these diseases. Lecture topics are reinforced with readings from primary literature, guided discussions, and laboratory simulation activities.",

Family can be a safe space: it is a source of profound love, immense sacrifice, and courageous solidarity. But family may also threaten grave dangers: old resentments blossom, new disputes loom, and the weight of ancient wrongs is never fully relieved. In this interdisciplinary course, we explore the transgressive acts committed in the name of family\u2014for love, for rage, for vengeance\u2014as well as the artistic dialogues surrounding them through the ages. This journey begins with some of the most notoriously dysfunctional families ever depicted\u2014those of Heracles, Medea, Oedipus, and Agamemnon in the tragic dramas of ancient Greece. Devoting particular attention to the theatrical construction of gender in family relationships, we consider how Athenian drama figured in the societal controversies of its time and why it continues to be relevant today. With these dramatic works as our template, we move to their contemporary analogue in <i>The Godfather</i> cinematic trilogy, in which notions of family honor spur shocking acts of violence. Throughout the course, we have frequent opportunity to consider why visions of fate, criminal wrongdoing, and inherited guilt continue to haunt popular depictions of family even today.",

Should climate change be primarily understood as a technical problem, an economic problem, a moral one, or something else? Students investigate different ways of understanding the challenge climate change poses, exploring the advantages and drawbacks of each approach. With an understanding of the problem in hand, we turn towards the second main question: what sort of solutions should we pursue in the fight against climate change? Should the market be the primary tool for addressing the problem? Should we rest our faith in technologies like carbon removal and solar geoengineering? Or should we focus on living smaller lifestyles and producing and consuming less overall? What should we do if efforts to promote the right solutions end up unsuccessful because of the vested interests of powerful people and corporations?

This course engages students with major theories and foundational ideas from political science that seek to answer these big comparative questions. In doing so, the course introduces students to the field of comparative politics and to the practice of social scientific inquiry. The substantive focus of the course through the first week is on democracy. When do democracies fail? How do countries become democracies, and why do some get there but not others? And finally, how do dictatorships work? We consider cases from eighteenth-century France to the fall of authoritarianism in Latin America and Eastern Europe in just the past few decades. The second week surveys the remainder of the comparative politics literature across two big topics: economic development and conflict. Why are some countries rich and others poor? We examine economic successes like Singapore and South Korea as well as failures like Kenya and Venezuela. Why are some countries stable, while others experience violence and conflict? We compare political violence from medieval Europe to current-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. Through the lens of these three big topics\u2014democracy, development, and conflict\u2014students receive a broad lay of the land of the field of comparative politics.

For tens of millions of Americans, especially those who are poor, African American, Hispanic, or Native American, the prison system is the most well-funded and consistent presence of government in their lives. How did this happen? What were the historical forces, actors, and events that created this system of incarceration? Does it need to be this way? Can we as a nation respond to the problems of crime and drug addiction differently? What could alternatives look like? This course unpacks the historical origins of mass incarceration in the United States from the decades of Prohibition and internment in the 1920s and 1930s to our recent past with the War on Drugs in the 1980s and the immigration detention programs of the Trump administration in the late 2010s. It aims to help students understand the social, political, and public policy history of jails, prisons, and policing agencies to make sense of the evolving institutions of crime, criminality, confinement, and criminal justice in modern America.",

Few Americans question why they must exchange their work with employers for a wage, purchase food in the form of commodities from store owners, and pay either a landlord or bankers in order to shelter themselves from the elements. Answers to these basic questions about the fundamental social relationships of American life are anything but self-evident. In order to be satisfyingly answered, these questions require historical analysis. In this course, students embark on the task of explaining these fundamental relationships by analyzing some of our society's formative experiences. In other words, they make sense of the transition of capitalism in the United State of America. Topics of study include capitalism as a concept, the colonization of North America, industrialization, slavery, and the Civil War and Reconstruction. Students enrolled in this course can expect to improve their reading ability, strengthen their understanding of the historical method, and come to terms with the importance of the past for the present.",

Throughout the course, students are asked to balance the readings for each class with a relevant primary source. The first hour of each class consists of a lecture, followed by a break, before reconvening for a seminar-style discussion on the assigned readings in addition to a new primary source to be selected by the instructor for each discussion. Students then break down this new primary source with one another in order to place it within the larger context of the day's lecture and other readings. The goal of this course is to help broaden students' understanding of their role as citizens and scholars, to help expand their understanding of the fragile nature of democracy and the consequences of nationalism, and to help them engage in the production of history through an analysis of primary and secondary sources.",

But how did indigenous people living under colonialism tell the story of Spanish invasion? How did they recall and narrate events that pre-dated Spanish presence? How do historians tell the story of past lives that were almost entirely left out of the historical record? This introductory course to the history of colonial Latin America encourages students to tackle these and other challenging questions in an effort to better comprehend indigenous understandings of the past. Together, we explore the many ways native people told stories about what had transpired, including their use of oral histories, material culture, and unique recording devices. We also learn from the wide array of methodologies that historians and other scholars have employed to unearth the history of indigenous people. A main objective of this course is to introduce students to foundational methods of historical enquiry; for this purpose, we explore a diverse set of primary and secondary sources that draw on examples from both North and South America. Daily required readings give students the opportunity to hone critical reading and analysis skills, as well as to become familiar with diverse scholars' takes on some of the most important and controversial questions in the field of colonial Latin American indigenous history. Likewise, in-class discussions give students the opportunity to ask questions, clarify concepts, and engage in fruitful discussions with their peers.

Through a historical lens, we examine how such thinking permeated into society, affected political policy, contributed to the development of biased medical research, justified the management and control of marginalized populations, and fueled movements such as eugenics and white supremacy. Returning to science, we consider empirical genetic evidence and what it reveals about human variation. This allows us to contrast the historical placement of humans into categories with new understandings of human variation as a distribution across the geographic landscape, influenced by evolutionary forces. Finally, we ask how these themes help us understand racial issues today and how science can be an aid in combating racism.

We do this by analyzing the views of thinkers from across history who have grappled with the question\u2014beginning with contemporary philosophers like AJ Ayer who have challenged our ability to even make sense of the question, and then reaching back to ancient views (Aristotle and Seneca) through the medievals (Augustine and Dante), and finally making our way back up to modern times (S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Albert Camus, and Thomas Nagel).

On the one hand, it seems that one should form a belief only when there is sufficient evidence that guarantees the truth of that belief. On the other hand, our temptation to answer yes to some of the questions above suggests that we can stand in an epistemic relationship with ourselves and with others on grounds that are not merely evidential.

The larger framework of Einstein's general relativity is then introduced, focusing on the underlying equivalence principle and how space-time is properly described by a metric. At the end of the course, Einstein's field equations are introduced and applications to gravitational wave interferometry and black holes are briefly discussed. The course concludes with comments on how these staples of relativity fit into the current formulation of fundamental physics.",

Stuck in a frustrating period of waithood, or waiting for adulthood, urban youths in Africa are increasingly devising enterprising ways to improvise their livelihoods and assert their right to the city. One creative way in which youths are responding to everyday uncertainty and frustration is through the power of pop culture, which includes creating new artistic, musical, performance, and fashion forms that extend across and beyond African cities. Consider, for example, the cross-cultural power and global appeal of Afrobeats. Notable American musicians, from Beyonc\u00e9 to Pharrell Williams are fast integrating African pop music into their sounds as part of the upward trend of the Afro-Cool in the United States. This raises important questions about the boundaries between what is cultural appreciation and what is cultural appropriation. In the face of the contradictions of modern city life in Africa, in which people's opportunities and expectations are simultaneously broadened and constrained, how do young people fashion new ways of being and interacting with society? In what ways can crisis become opportunity? To address these questions, we watch films, listen critically to music, analyze written texts, take virtual tours, and visualize fashion and popular art forms that shed new light on the hustle economy in urban Africa, its relationship with pop culture in American cities, and the innovative ways in which young people are making their voices heard in the city.",

Social medicine is a discipline that examines how political, economic, and historic forces become embodied as pathologies and how the same forces that create uneven distribution of disease also create barriers to care. Some of the pathologies we examine are addiction, hunger, homelessness, mental illness, and homicide, all worsened by racism, sexism, and sometimes the very institutions that ought to help. In this course, we emphasize understanding the observations, judgements, and calls to action from people who endure the miseries of poverty. To do so, students read ethnographic research in medical anthropology and learn directly from community members during class visits. Students complete three group ethnographic exercises which take them to a jail, ask them to report on a program for the homeless, and create an act of service based on what they learn from their informants is a specific need for physical survival.",

During the past twenty-five years, we have discovered roughly 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars. Just over twenty years ago, the systematic study of supernovae explosions led to the discovery of a new and still not understood component of the universe called dark energy. In 2016, gravitational radiation was detected for the first time, allowing us to detect the mergers of distant black holes. In this course we select five areas of current research and use these to introduce and study the basic concepts of astronomy. The course is designed to help students get a feel for what it is like to be an astronomer, using the new generation of ground- and space-based telescopes, combined with sophisticated theoretical techniques and computational facilities. As we study each aspect of the universe, we ask how we came to know what we know today and how astronomers are investigating still-unanswered questions.",

Recent advances in planetary exploration, astronomy, geochemistry, and biochemistry are leading to a revolution in our ideas on the emergence of life on our own planet and the likelihood of finding life outside the Earth. In particular, much is being learned about Mars and Venus because of the many recent and ongoing space missions. Spectacular data from Jupiter's and Saturn's moons, like Titan, Europa, and Enceladus, show that these moons may become possible targets of future searches for life. Geochemists are finding more and more intriguing clues about the Earth's past by analyzing rocks dating from the very first period after the Earth's formation, thus providing a fundamentally new context for research on the transition between chemistry and primordial life. And the search for extra-solar planets is leading to the discovery of Earth-like planets around solar-type stars. In this course, students are introduced to current and planned telescopic space missions aimed at finding and characterizing exoplanets and robotic missions, such as the Mars rovers.

We call these Darwinian processes. In parallel, epidemiology and public health deal with the distribution and determinants of human diseases and mortality. They investigate the origin, distribution, management, and control of agents that cause both communicable and non-communicable diseases within and between populations among a wide range of species. This course offers a comprehensive understanding of how the foundational principles of evolutionary genetics and public health intersect to shape human health and longevity. Through an interdisciplinary approach, we explore the nexus of evolutionary genetics and public health, contextualizing our discussions within the broader spheres of comparative medicine and environmental factors, such as global warming. This approach illuminates the collective influence of Darwinian processes on the evolution, maintenance, and spread of diseases.

        "course_description": "The study of decision making has a long tradition, particularly in economics, where the choices of economic agents have been analyzed with the aid of a number of methodologies and theoretical models. Many academic researches and empirical evidence show how institutional and retail investors are inclined to make mistakes when making financial decisions; moreover, people do not have stable preferences, but make choices that are influenced by the context\u2014and the feelings\u2014in which individuals are asked to make a decision. Neuroscience methodologies applied to investments (so-called neuroinvesting) help to explain these anomalies, highlighting how investors' brains and bodies react to different stimuli and situations. In-depth knowledge of neuroinvesting foundations is then crucial for making informed decisions and therefore better choices, which are consistent with investors' needs and expectations. This course aims to help participants to understand practical impacts and benefits that neuroscience applied to investments has on investors' decision-making processes. Starting from an overview about what neuroscience is and how brain activity can be measured, the course describes the underlying mechanisms related to motivations and to judgments under risk and uncertainty. The course focuses on the role of emotions and on investors' risk perception and risk tolerance. The course ends by introducing pathological choices, ethics, and trust.",

In the midst of such change and continuity, this course sets out to ask what place does Latinx occupy in this long history? What does Latinidad look like when we trace it back 530 years, when we take 1492 to be its starting point instead of the twentieth century? How might this look backwards help us understand the current Latinx politics of gender (Latino versus Latina versus Latinx), sexuality (the place of queerness and transness in Latinx studies), and race (Latinidad's penchant for disavowing blackness and erasing indigeneity)? We answer these questions as we move through different historical and literary periods in dialogue with writing by, for example, colonial Spanish historian Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, nineteenth-century Cuban intellect Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed from exile in New York, twentieth-century queer Chicana theorist Gloria Anzald\u00faa, and contemporary Honduran-Garifuna writer Janel Mart\u00ednez.",

Next, we examine various examples of propaganda and their manifestations, both historical as well as more contemporaneous (for example, World War I and World War II, Russian and Chinese troll farms, and the 2021 US Capitol riot).

From France's anti-immigrant National Front and neo-Nazis in Germany to efforts to rehabilitate Francisco Franco and Benito Mussolini in Spain and Italy, forces of extreme nationalism, xenophobia, and imperial nostalgia have increased in prominence as well as popularity. The current moment is not, of course, the first time that the continent has experienced a rise in right-wing extremism. Fascism, from the 1920s onward, likewise offered violent, totalitarian solutions to the tensions of mass politics and populist resentment in polarized societies. How, precisely, do today's reactionary political formations relate to their fascistic forebears? What social and cultural dynamics is each responding to and, perhaps just as significantly, what historical legacies are they drawing on? In this course, we ask how has the present wave of far-right parties in western and central Europe tapped into notions of national decline, instability, and changing demographics? What can we learn about these movements by studying histories of European fascism in France, Germany, Spain, and Italy? And finally, how have these histories been obscured and rehabilitated in different ways in each of these countries? By moving from contemporary cases of resurgent nationalist sentiment to their interwar predecessors and back again, and through a consideration of novels, films, historical documents, speeches, and monuments, the course seeks to uncover how anxieties of migration, race, and empire\u2014as well as changing roles of religion, gender, and nationhood\u2014shaped political animosities and allegiances within the European far right both a century ago and today.",

The Jewish presence in modern-day Spain and Portugal was established in antiquity and eliminated, violently and systematically, through the series of tribunals, expulsions, and mass conversions organized under the Inquisition. Although the language\u2014with its signature blend of Hispano-Romance and Hebraic elements\u2014disappeared from the Iberian Peninsula long ago, it lives on in the Sephardic diaspora, in Israel and, to a lesser extent, the United States as well as Turkey, where for centuries ancestrally Spanish and Portuguese Jews intermingled with their Ottoman hosts, acquiring numerous loanwords in the process. As its community of native speakers contracts, Judeo-Spanish today faces a future perhaps more uncertain than that which it faced on Iberian soil when the Inquisition began in 1492. Blending conventional coursework in language instruction with elements of literary and cultural studies, this course is a first experiment in reviving the language at home, in Cambridge. In class we explore a series of basic provocations about the nature of the language, including: just how capacious is the term Ladino? Is an <i>aljamiado</i> (that is, Hebrew-script) text in Spanish by default a Ladino text? What distinguishes, culturally and concretely, this language from Old Spanish and its modern descendants? In addition to supporting students' progress in reading, writing, and rudimentary oral and aural skills, the course attempts to trace the long line connecting us, as learners, to the Romance-speaking Jews of medieval Iberia\u2014and to appreciate the cultural artefacts by which that lineage is so spectacularly distinguished.",

In this course we explore a range of stories and different forms of storytelling on gender justice, from novels and films to memoirs and personal histories, histories, and creative nonfiction. Some narratives with which we engage are Margaret Atwood's <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>, Ito Shiori's <i>Black Box: The Memoir that Sparked Japan's #MeToo Movement</i>, Audre Lorde's <i>The Cancer Journals</i>, Cynthia Enloe's <i>The Big Push: Exposing and Challenging the Persistence of Patriarchy</i>, Cho Nam-joo's <i>Kim Ji-young, Born 1982</i>, and Cherrie Moraga and Gloria Anzald\u00faa's <i>This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color</i>. Students are also encouraged to write their own stories on gender and justice.",

We consider how pursuing the goals of better children, superior performance, ageless bodies, or happy souls might be aided or hindered, elevated or degraded, by seeking them through a wide variety of technological means.

What does our appeal to evil say about our sense of humanity, religion, and God? And how do we cope with suffering? This course takes up these questions through a variety of lenses drawn from Western thought: religious, philosophical, theological, and ethical. Readings include Jewish and Christian scriptures (the books of Genesis, Job, and Paul), classic theologians and philosophers (St. Augustine, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Immanuel Kant), novelists (Fyodor Dostoevsky and Annie Dillard), and contemporary critics (Susan Neiman, Hannah Arendt, and Haim Gouri).

How do these things happen? This course explores the psychological mechanisms that enable cults to form and to take things to such extremes. What do cults share with other groups (mainstream religions, nations, and everyday social interactions), and what makes them stand apart? In what ways are cults an environment in which many of our psychological tendencies (toward ingroup conformity, heuristic decision making, and rationalization) are magnified?

Topics such as generative AI and data privacy are explored in depth to demonstrate the necessity of the panoramic approach. Questions such as what is intelligence or what is privacy require philosophical contemplation, while assessing the impact of generative AI or means to protect individual privacy demand careful sociological, computational, and statistical thinking.

We consider major cities such as Kyiv, Odessa, Lviv, Kharkiv, and Dnipro, as well as Jewish shtetls and monuments of Soviet industrial sublime, such as the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station. We explore such topics as the reactionary responses to modernity ranging from anti-semitism to religious conservatism; the central role of the city and urbanization; making and unmaking of nationalities; public hygiene and the limits of control; revolutionary culture and artistic avant-garde; the long-lasting effects of wars and extreme violence on society; the curse of resources; and the rise of mass culture and sport, among others. Students learn why studying Ukraine is essential for our understanding of the modern world.",

At the present moment, however, it seems in many minds to have lost its evocative power as a collective myth. One wonders: does it still represent a principle of hope or has it become a form of cruel optimism? In a time of prolonged political and social crisis, this course has a pressing mission. It aims to further a dynamic understanding of American dreams (for there are many and not just one), to apprehend their complexities and contradictions, to appreciate their diverse manifestations and historical shapes, and above all to take measure of their presence and meaning in the world we now inhabit. To this end we study the variety of ways in which feature filmmakers, both in and outside of Hollywood studios, have created designs for living; indeed, the most influential and resonant incarnations of American dreams. We analyze popular narratives produced during crucial junctures in the modern history of the United States, from the Great Depression and World War II, through the cold war and the McCarthy era, up to the late 1960s. We consider the wide range of functions that these productions have assumed, how they have by turns sustained and questioned the status quo. In some instances they have interrogated, revealed, and even indicted social inequity, at other times they have legitimated injustice and fostered exclusion.",

Instead, they were emphasizing the great moderation, that is, the idea that business cycles had vanished for all practical purposes. These economists were wrong because they disregarded warning signs and used inadequate economic models to gauge the situation. Similarly, the COVID-19 recession occurred just at the time when pundits were boasting of a roaring economy.

Rapid economic growth, urbanization, and increasing population have resulted in an increase in resource consumption and the consequent generation of large amounts of waste. This generation of waste reflects a loss of materials and energy and imposes economic and environmental costs on society for its collection, management, and disposal. Of the 17 sustainable development goals of the United Nations, four are directly or partially related to waste management such as food waste, recycling, global carbon emissions, and the use of plastics. Traditional waste management options are chosen based on affordability, technical feasibility, and aesthetics. These options lack a holistic approach covering the whole chain of product design, raw material extraction, production, consumption, recycling, and waste management. Further, current waste management practices do not fully evaluate the ancillary human health and environmental impacts and the environmental equity of the chosen options. The recent detection of forever chemicals (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS) in waste threatens to disrupt most of the current waste management options. Although zero waste is an ambitious goal for many communities, currently, there is little evidence of decoupling of affluence and waste generation.",

Therefore, the course is focused on the governing structures through which actors inside and outside of the government attempt to gain, wield, and challenge power on climate policymaking. We explore theories and analytical frameworks from political science, public policy, and Chinese studies. We use these theoretical and analytical lenses to analyze ongoing and historical climate policy cases. This course helps students understand the institutions and key actors that influence climate policymaking and apply this knowledge to current cases. The first unit of the course focuses on the ideas of environmental issues. It explores the concepts behind climate politics, the economic and social factors that influence Chinese views about climate issues, and the governing systems that shape the distribution of resources and power in the climate policymaking process. The second unit examines the key actors and institutions involved in climate policymaking. It investigates how institutional incentives and governing structures shape key actors' involvement in the climate policy process. The third unit focuses on non-state actors, including environmental non-governmental organizations, expert communities, and international organizations. It examines the opportunities and challenges that non-state actors have encountered in the climate policymaking process. Each class begins with a discussion of the conceptual frameworks, which are then applied to explain ongoing cases, including those related to climate change. The goal of the discussions is to understand how theoretical and analytical frameworks can apply to case studies and how to choose a feasible framework to understand the political dynamics of Chinese climate policymaking and China's climate ambitions internationally and domestically.",

A single volcanic eruption off Tonga increased global atmospheric water vapor (our most abundant greenhouse gas) by five percent. Water became a weapon in the Ukrainian war. Insurance companies began pulling out of covering wildfire insurance as forests dried in the western United States, while updated flood insurance premiums skyrocketed nationally. All rainwater was discovered to contain dangerous levels of forever chemicals. Devastating floods submerged one-third of Pakistan underwater. And the United States, for the first time, declared water a national security priority. This course examines how rapid transformations in earth's hydrological cycle will transform humanity's relationship to its most precious resource in the decades to come. We start with an overview of the centrality of water to climate change, the orphaned status of water in climate policy and climate talks, the systemic problems that have produced this disconnect, the incentives that sustain it, and the conflicts that result. We then spend each class looking at a specific water development from the past five years that serve as the context for shaping our understanding of the social, political, environmental, and security dimensions of our changing water cycle.

The fourth industrial revolution, a fusion of cutting-edge technologies (for example, blockchain, artificial intelligence [AI], metaverse, internet-of-things, hyper-automation, digital twins, and big data) is blurring the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds. Thanks to the great accelerator of the COVID-19 pandemic, digitalization is increasingly ubiquitous in our daily life, defining how we work and radically disrupting how we do business. But such digital transformation carries its own risks and opportunities. The World Economic Forum estimates that digital technologies have the potential to save up to 20 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Yet, the rapid proliferation of digitalization has far-reaching negative impacts on the environment and society. The ever-growing carbon footprint of the digital sector (for example, hardware, software, networks, and data centers) is now larger than that of the aviation one. Similarly, the digital era has introduced a new wave of societal and ethical concerns arising from the adoption of such technologies. Further understanding of such risks is imperative to make digitalization sustainable in the future. This course introduces students to the sustainability challenges associated with digital technologies. We explore the environmentally and socially responsible use of digital technologies. Course topics include the evaluation of digital carbon footprints, the promise of clean AI, the need for energy-aware computing, the unsustainable role of digital assets (for example, cryptocurrency), the deepening of the digital divide, and the rising tide of climate change disinformation. The course also examines the taxonomy of digital justice, with a focus on ethical issues of emerging technologies. The course draws on case studies and contributions from active practitioners.

This course guides students through the intricate process of transforming sustainability challenges into actionable projects or business opportunities. Through this journey, students craft sustainable ventures that prioritize environmental responsibility, financial sustainability, and meaningful global impact. This is a project-based course that melds entrepreneurial leadership with practical strategies tailored for sustainability. Students explore entrepreneurial leadership and mindset to understand the characteristics, motivations, and behaviors of entrepreneurs who emphasize sustainability. We cover marketing strategies for sustainability, which allow students to master market and consumer research, trend forecasting, and develop compelling marketing plans and messages tailored for sustainable ventures. Students learn to understand business structures in order to navigate the spectrum from for-profit corporations to social enterprises and charitable organizations, emphasizing the role of social entrepreneurship. We introduce the topic of impact measurement, so students recognize the importance of quantifying the social and environmental impact of ventures using industry-specific sustainability metrics. Emphasis is placed on vision, values, and high-performing teams, including how to establish a robust organizational vision, appreciate the role of values in guiding business actions, and learn the intricacies of building and engaging high-performing teams. Finally, we also cover financing and delve into the triple bottom line concept, exploring financing strategies that concurrently measure social, environmental, and financial impacts. This course is designed to amplify passion and knowledge, presenting students with a comprehensive framework that turns ideas into high-impact solutions.

In a future of climate-driven disasters, there is an even stronger imperative to consider the social, economic, and political frameworks that give rise to the conditions which presage disaster. Given that climate-driven disasters will invariably fall harder on the global south, we also face a rising moral imperative to consider how disaster prevention and response can either perpetuate or ameliorate longstanding issues of climate justice. The course begins with an overview of traditional top-down international disaster response frameworks beginning in the mid-twentieth century and charts the evolution of more grassroots, community-driven models. Students are asked to identify an issue of resilience or potential disaster from within their own communities and develop a speculative approach for its resolution. Students are asked to interview and liaise with individuals, groups, and businesses local to their community; diagram community dynamics; and crowd-source ideas for a more livable future. Students then work either on their own or in teams and extrapolate lessons learned in their own communities into a wider proposal for a new model for global disaster response, rooted in community-based practice.",

Through critical reading and presentation of research articles, students learn how to form questions that can be addressed experimentally and how to write a corresponding, testable hypothesis. The course also addresses the process of experimental design and current experimental methodologies in biology. Students are given multiple opportunities to hone their writing skills on several short writing assignments. Students are expected to participate in class discussions, present a paper to the class, and write a final research proposal due at the end of the semester. We focus our attention on innovations in genetics and genomics. Some background in these areas is beneficial but not required. Students learn to think scientifically while they gain knowledge of how recent advancements can be applied to agriculture, vaccine developments, personalized medicine, and other areas. Because skills learned in this course are useful in subsequent courses, it is the first course that prospective Master of Liberal Arts (ALM) candidates should take toward the degree (or the second, if they are completing the expository writing prerequisite). While not designed to be a thesis or capstone proposal course, this course does serve as a foundation for eventual work on the thesis or capstone.",

A major conclusion from those experiences is the conviction that we need to expand technologies that lead to effective vaccine nominations and development. This interactive, discussion-based course is designed to highlight the most recent advances in immunology, microbiology, and vaccinology regarding new vaccine developments. The focus of the course is to understand how vaccines against bacterial pathogens were developed in the past and what improvements can be implemented today. Using real-life clinical cases, we make connections between disease manifestations, cellular responses, immunity, and infection. We cover general principles of vaccinology and discuss examples of successful vaccines that were produced using reverse vaccinology approaches. For example, we discuss how a serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis was discovered and why it is efficacious. We also talk about one of the oldest vaccines in the world, bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and define its protective efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and cross-protection offered against SARS-CoV-2. We discuss why there are no currently available vaccines against pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or E. coli. Students learn to understand results from past and ongoing clinical trials where vaccines targeting difficult-to-handle pathogens are evaluated. We talk about the importance of machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches to developing new vaccines. Finally, we discuss how advancements in sciences are translated in the budding of new biotech start-ups and spin-offs, which offer new approaches for vaccine development.

Yet the dominant economic growth model in rich and poor nations has created a global climate crisis. The course explores the promise of sustainable development that integrates natural and social science concerns, and reviews failures of sustainability that have at times increased landlessness, disease, hunger, pollution, and social disintegration. We examine principles and best practices in development and learn underlying concepts in population dynamics, poverty reduction, public health, and technology innovation to meet critical needs in energy and food security. Case studies help us learn the importance of methods for planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Students are introduced to the institutional landscape for development assistance including multilateral agencies such as the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the New Development Bank; bilateral agencies as the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA); nongovernmental organizations as Oxfam, the Aga Khan Development Network, BRAC; and social movements for development and peace such as Sarvodaya Shramadana. The course aims to benefit students seeking a foundation in development as well as those wishing to enhance skills in policy advocacy.

These efforts, often driven by grassroots activism, offer valuable lessons for transforming the places we live. This course focuses on the unique ways in which US cities are working to mitigate and adapt to climate change while creating equitable and livable communities in the process. Four main themes and twelve case studies show how US cities are reclaiming their streets from cars, restoring watersheds, growing forests, and adapting shorelines to improve people's lives while addressing our changing climate. The course relates national models to field study in Boston and Cambridge, where we meet with local advocates, community groups, government officials, scientists, and urban designers. Students walk the Rose Kennedy Greenway and visit the site of the Big Dig to learn how Boston buried an interstate highway and built a world-class park over it. We ride the region's evolving bike network, featuring paths that are among the best in the country, and meet with city transportation planners to better understand how bike and scooter shares are complimenting public transit. Tours focus on the ways in which Boston's efforts to make its streets safer are also a part of its green infrastructure plans to manage stormwater. We examine Boston's tree canopy, observing how disparities in urban trees correlate to race and income and, subsequently, inequities in exposure to air pollution and extreme heat. We paddle the Charles River and learn about how the Resilient Boston Harbor Plan aims to protect the city from sea-level rise and storm surge by creating green spaces along the city's 75 kilometer shoreline. Class assignments engage students in researching, measuring, and engaging in individual and group projects related to the themes of the course.

Given this, creativity has become as important as literacy. Whether operating in the corporate, startup, social entrepreneurship, not-for-profit, or public sectors, organizations increasingly need people who understand the creative process; know how to manage, motivate, and engage creative professionals; and can develop an organizational culture that encourages experimentation, considers the inevitable failures as learning opportunities, and enables innovative outcomes. This course focuses on best practices in creativity and innovation, exploring the interplay between creativity, organizational processes and systems, and successful innovation. Throughout the course we explore tools and techniques for fostering individual and group creativity, management practices that foster (or inhibit) innovation, methods for developing and evaluating ideas for new products and services, the business models to execute these ideas, and principles and practices for leading innovation.

We include the obvious connections between fundraising and membership to attendance and social media. We also take a deep look at collections management systems to see patterns of giving that may be leveraged if connections were made to other data. We look at this information from the perspective of the museum educator. Assembling information on programs offered, attendance, and evaluations informs current and future programs and ensures their success. However, big data goes beyond bringing information about constituents and visitors together. Digitizing historical collections allows researchers to analyze the information in field notes, specimen records, and the scientific analysis conducted during the field work. Trends can be measured and compared to current data, giving scientists access to information that may be hidden in the paper records.

In the past several decades, exciting new discoveries on the neurobiology of sleep have been facilitated by technologies such as functional neuroimaging and molecular genetics. Nonetheless, sleep remains mysterious and controversial and, remarkably, there still is no generally agreed upon function for this behavioral state that occupies one third of our lives. Importantly, sleep science exemplifies the translational approach in biomedical science whereby human and animal research together continually advance the field of sleep medicine. Following an overview on the physiology and behavioral neuroscience of sleep, students choose a topic related to the effects of sleep on mental health to research in depth, to present to the class, and to discuss in a term paper. Topics might include the characteristic abnormalities in sleep occurring in mood, anxiety, psychotic, addictive, autism spectrum, or neurodegenerative disorders. Such changes are increasingly seen as bidirectional, with sleep disturbances contributing to the waking symptoms of these mental disorders. Other topics might focus on the contribution of primary sleep disorders to psychiatric and neurological illness such as the linkage between sleep apnea and depression, circadian rhythm disorders in bipolar illness, insomnia as a risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders, or contribution of nocturnal seizures to neurodevelopmental disorders. Still other topics may focus on the contribution of normal sleep to emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and human performance factors. For those with more neuroscientific interests, topics might include neuroimaging of cognitive functioning following sleep deprivation or the growing interest in trafficking and disposal of abnormal proteins during sleep having a potential role in neurodegenerative illness.",
