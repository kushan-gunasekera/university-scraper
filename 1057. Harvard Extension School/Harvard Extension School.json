While most medical research focuses on the biology of disease, this course takes a biosocial approach to unmask how social factors, economic insecurity, and the availability of massive amounts of pharmaceuticals have become an overdose crisis. In the first part of the course, we explore the connection between opioid addiction and crime, especially under conditions of poverty, chaos, and violence. Then, we explore how people search for health care and support when condemned to precarious lives. By investigating the opioid epidemic in this way, students are encouraged to think boldly and creatively beyond the traditional boundaries of medicine; perhaps someone's best medicine is a housing voucher or a testing strip to detect fentanyl. By the end of the course, students understand the social roots of the opioid epidemic and how solutions may be implemented.",

We consider questions such as: how do the different kinds of exchanges we engage in\u2014gift exchanges versus market exchanges, for instance\u2014shape our relationships with others? We explore the social meaning of money and the role of the market in our lives. In a world where it is possible to rent a family, does money destroy love and intimacy? What aspects of our lives are governed by the logic of capitalism and what aspects escape capitalism's grip? Why does it feel shameful to be in debt and how has this shame been manipulated for political purposes? Why in the US do we consider work to be sacred and morally purifying even though many of us have tedious jobs?

However, the last 200 years are not the only period of drastic environmental change in Earth's history. In the 4.5 billion years since forming, Earth has experienced an atmosphere devoid of oxygen, been covered by glaciers, and hosted mass extinctions caused by both increases and decreases in temperature. This course aims to give students a deep-time perspective on Earth's climate, insights into the mechanisms controlling it, and the impacts of those changes. Students get hands-on experience examining and evaluating the supporting evidence during lab activities in addition to reading primary literature. We start by understanding Earth as a system, what the current state of that system is, controlling factors on climate, and how climate changes. The course then focuses on individual periods of dramatic climatic shifts including oxidation of the atmosphere (2.5 billion years ago), global glaciation (720-635 million years ago), sea level drop from global cooling (443 million years ago), massive volcanism (254 and 66 million years ago), asteroid impact (66 million years ago), and the impact of planetary cycles. Understanding the causes and consequences of past climatic events prepares students to better examine the current period of global climate changes and potential futures of Earth. Each class includes time for paper discussion, lectures on new material, and lab activities focused on evaluating evidence. For the final project, students select a policy or regulation that could mitigate the impacts of climate change. They research what the policy aims to address, how it would work, and its potential effectiveness before presenting on the last day of class.

Three major groups of animals are discussed: parasitic protozoa, parasitic helminths, and those arthropods that directly cause disease or act as vectors of various pathogens. Basic types and concepts of animal associations are discussed. Then we investigate the major groups of parasites, followed by the morphology, life cycle, pathology, treatment, and control of these species. We also explore molecular mechanisms in the host-parasite relationship, the influence of parasites on the ecology and evolution of their hosts, the modes of action of chemotherapeutic agents, and strategies for the possible eradication of these diseases. Lecture topics are reinforced with readings from primary literature, guided discussions, and laboratory simulation activities.",

Family can be a safe space: it is a source of profound love, immense sacrifice, and courageous solidarity. But family may also threaten grave dangers: old resentments blossom, new disputes loom, and the weight of ancient wrongs is never fully relieved. In this interdisciplinary course, we explore the transgressive acts committed in the name of family\u2014for love, for rage, for vengeance\u2014as well as the artistic dialogues surrounding them through the ages. This journey begins with some of the most notoriously dysfunctional families ever depicted\u2014those of Heracles, Medea, Oedipus, and Agamemnon in the tragic dramas of ancient Greece. Devoting particular attention to the theatrical construction of gender in family relationships, we consider how Athenian drama figured in the societal controversies of its time and why it continues to be relevant today. With these dramatic works as our template, we move to their contemporary analogue in <i>The Godfather</i> cinematic trilogy, in which notions of family honor spur shocking acts of violence. Throughout the course, we have frequent opportunity to consider why visions of fate, criminal wrongdoing, and inherited guilt continue to haunt popular depictions of family even today.",

Should climate change be primarily understood as a technical problem, an economic problem, a moral one, or something else? Students investigate different ways of understanding the challenge climate change poses, exploring the advantages and drawbacks of each approach. With an understanding of the problem in hand, we turn towards the second main question: what sort of solutions should we pursue in the fight against climate change? Should the market be the primary tool for addressing the problem? Should we rest our faith in technologies like carbon removal and solar geoengineering? Or should we focus on living smaller lifestyles and producing and consuming less overall? What should we do if efforts to promote the right solutions end up unsuccessful because of the vested interests of powerful people and corporations?

This course engages students with major theories and foundational ideas from political science that seek to answer these big comparative questions. In doing so, the course introduces students to the field of comparative politics and to the practice of social scientific inquiry. The substantive focus of the course through the first week is on democracy. When do democracies fail? How do countries become democracies, and why do some get there but not others? And finally, how do dictatorships work? We consider cases from eighteenth-century France to the fall of authoritarianism in Latin America and Eastern Europe in just the past few decades. The second week surveys the remainder of the comparative politics literature across two big topics: economic development and conflict. Why are some countries rich and others poor? We examine economic successes like Singapore and South Korea as well as failures like Kenya and Venezuela. Why are some countries stable, while others experience violence and conflict? We compare political violence from medieval Europe to current-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. Through the lens of these three big topics\u2014democracy, development, and conflict\u2014students receive a broad lay of the land of the field of comparative politics.

For tens of millions of Americans, especially those who are poor, African American, Hispanic, or Native American, the prison system is the most well-funded and consistent presence of government in their lives. How did this happen? What were the historical forces, actors, and events that created this system of incarceration? Does it need to be this way? Can we as a nation respond to the problems of crime and drug addiction differently? What could alternatives look like? This course unpacks the historical origins of mass incarceration in the United States from the decades of Prohibition and internment in the 1920s and 1930s to our recent past with the War on Drugs in the 1980s and the immigration detention programs of the Trump administration in the late 2010s. It aims to help students understand the social, political, and public policy history of jails, prisons, and policing agencies to make sense of the evolving institutions of crime, criminality, confinement, and criminal justice in modern America.",

Few Americans question why they must exchange their work with employers for a wage, purchase food in the form of commodities from store owners, and pay either a landlord or bankers in order to shelter themselves from the elements. Answers to these basic questions about the fundamental social relationships of American life are anything but self-evident. In order to be satisfyingly answered, these questions require historical analysis. In this course, students embark on the task of explaining these fundamental relationships by analyzing some of our society's formative experiences. In other words, they make sense of the transition of capitalism in the United State of America. Topics of study include capitalism as a concept, the colonization of North America, industrialization, slavery, and the Civil War and Reconstruction. Students enrolled in this course can expect to improve their reading ability, strengthen their understanding of the historical method, and come to terms with the importance of the past for the present.",

Throughout the course, students are asked to balance the readings for each class with a relevant primary source. The first hour of each class consists of a lecture, followed by a break, before reconvening for a seminar-style discussion on the assigned readings in addition to a new primary source to be selected by the instructor for each discussion. Students then break down this new primary source with one another in order to place it within the larger context of the day's lecture and other readings. The goal of this course is to help broaden students' understanding of their role as citizens and scholars, to help expand their understanding of the fragile nature of democracy and the consequences of nationalism, and to help them engage in the production of history through an analysis of primary and secondary sources.",

But how did indigenous people living under colonialism tell the story of Spanish invasion? How did they recall and narrate events that pre-dated Spanish presence? How do historians tell the story of past lives that were almost entirely left out of the historical record? This introductory course to the history of colonial Latin America encourages students to tackle these and other challenging questions in an effort to better comprehend indigenous understandings of the past. Together, we explore the many ways native people told stories about what had transpired, including their use of oral histories, material culture, and unique recording devices. We also learn from the wide array of methodologies that historians and other scholars have employed to unearth the history of indigenous people. A main objective of this course is to introduce students to foundational methods of historical enquiry; for this purpose, we explore a diverse set of primary and secondary sources that draw on examples from both North and South America. Daily required readings give students the opportunity to hone critical reading and analysis skills, as well as to become familiar with diverse scholars' takes on some of the most important and controversial questions in the field of colonial Latin American indigenous history. Likewise, in-class discussions give students the opportunity to ask questions, clarify concepts, and engage in fruitful discussions with their peers.

Through a historical lens, we examine how such thinking permeated into society, affected political policy, contributed to the development of biased medical research, justified the management and control of marginalized populations, and fueled movements such as eugenics and white supremacy. Returning to science, we consider empirical genetic evidence and what it reveals about human variation. This allows us to contrast the historical placement of humans into categories with new understandings of human variation as a distribution across the geographic landscape, influenced by evolutionary forces. Finally, we ask how these themes help us understand racial issues today and how science can be an aid in combating racism.

We do this by analyzing the views of thinkers from across history who have grappled with the question\u2014beginning with contemporary philosophers like AJ Ayer who have challenged our ability to even make sense of the question, and then reaching back to ancient views (Aristotle and Seneca) through the medievals (Augustine and Dante), and finally making our way back up to modern times (S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Albert Camus, and Thomas Nagel).

On the one hand, it seems that one should form a belief only when there is sufficient evidence that guarantees the truth of that belief. On the other hand, our temptation to answer yes to some of the questions above suggests that we can stand in an epistemic relationship with ourselves and with others on grounds that are not merely evidential.

The larger framework of Einstein's general relativity is then introduced, focusing on the underlying equivalence principle and how space-time is properly described by a metric. At the end of the course, Einstein's field equations are introduced and applications to gravitational wave interferometry and black holes are briefly discussed. The course concludes with comments on how these staples of relativity fit into the current formulation of fundamental physics.",

As an interdisciplinary course, we pull methods and theories from ethnic studies, American studies, gender and sexuality studies, history, and literary criticism. Some key questions that guide our course are: what are the benefits and challenges to understanding arts and culture from a historical perspective? How do we learn history from the arts and culture around us? What ideologies can we uncover through reading different genres of artistic production?

Stuck in a frustrating period of waithood, or waiting for adulthood, urban youths in Africa are increasingly devising enterprising ways to improvise their livelihoods and assert their right to the city. One creative way in which youths are responding to everyday uncertainty and frustration is through the power of pop culture, which includes creating new artistic, musical, performance, and fashion forms that extend across and beyond African cities. Consider, for example, the cross-cultural power and global appeal of Afrobeats. Notable American musicians, from Beyonc\u00e9 to Pharrell Williams are fast integrating African pop music into their sounds as part of the upward trend of the Afro-Cool in the United States. This raises important questions about the boundaries between what is cultural appreciation and what is cultural appropriation. In the face of the contradictions of modern city life in Africa, in which people's opportunities and expectations are simultaneously broadened and constrained, how do young people fashion new ways of being and interacting with society? In what ways can crisis become opportunity? To address these questions, we watch films, listen critically to music, analyze written texts, take virtual tours, and visualize fashion and popular art forms that shed new light on the hustle economy in urban Africa, its relationship with pop culture in American cities, and the innovative ways in which young people are making their voices heard in the city.",

Social medicine is a discipline that examines how political, economic, and historic forces become embodied as pathologies and how the same forces that create uneven distribution of disease also create barriers to care. Some of the pathologies we examine are addiction, hunger, homelessness, mental illness, and homicide, all worsened by racism, sexism, and sometimes the very institutions that ought to help. In this course, we emphasize understanding the observations, judgements, and calls to action from people who endure the miseries of poverty. To do so, students read ethnographic research in medical anthropology and learn directly from community members during class visits. Students complete three group ethnographic exercises which take them to a jail, ask them to report on a program for the homeless, and create an act of service based on what they learn from their informants is a specific need for physical survival.",

During the past twenty-five years, we have discovered roughly 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars. Just over twenty years ago, the systematic study of supernovae explosions led to the discovery of a new and still not understood component of the universe called dark energy. In 2016, gravitational radiation was detected for the first time, allowing us to detect the mergers of distant black holes. In this course we select five areas of current research and use these to introduce and study the basic concepts of astronomy. The course is designed to help students get a feel for what it is like to be an astronomer, using the new generation of ground- and space-based telescopes, combined with sophisticated theoretical techniques and computational facilities. As we study each aspect of the universe, we ask how we came to know what we know today and how astronomers are investigating still-unanswered questions.",

Recent advances in planetary exploration, astronomy, geochemistry, and biochemistry are leading to a revolution in our ideas on the emergence of life on our own planet and the likelihood of finding life outside the Earth. In particular, much is being learned about Mars and Venus because of the many recent and ongoing space missions. Spectacular data from Jupiter's and Saturn's moons, like Titan, Europa, and Enceladus, show that these moons may become possible targets of future searches for life. Geochemists are finding more and more intriguing clues about the Earth's past by analyzing rocks dating from the very first period after the Earth's formation, thus providing a fundamentally new context for research on the transition between chemistry and primordial life. And the search for extra-solar planets is leading to the discovery of Earth-like planets around solar-type stars. In this course, students are introduced to current and planned telescopic space missions aimed at finding and characterizing exoplanets and robotic missions, such as the Mars rovers.

We call these Darwinian processes. In parallel, epidemiology and public health deal with the distribution and determinants of human diseases and mortality. They investigate the origin, distribution, management, and control of agents that cause both communicable and non-communicable diseases within and between populations among a wide range of species. This course offers a comprehensive understanding of how the foundational principles of evolutionary genetics and public health intersect to shape human health and longevity. Through an interdisciplinary approach, we explore the nexus of evolutionary genetics and public health, contextualizing our discussions within the broader spheres of comparative medicine and environmental factors, such as global warming. This approach illuminates the collective influence of Darwinian processes on the evolution, maintenance, and spread of diseases.

        "course_description": "The study of decision making has a long tradition, particularly in economics, where the choices of economic agents have been analyzed with the aid of a number of methodologies and theoretical models. Many academic researches and empirical evidence show how institutional and retail investors are inclined to make mistakes when making financial decisions; moreover, people do not have stable preferences, but make choices that are influenced by the context\u2014and the feelings\u2014in which individuals are asked to make a decision. Neuroscience methodologies applied to investments (so-called neuroinvesting) help to explain these anomalies, highlighting how investors' brains and bodies react to different stimuli and situations. In-depth knowledge of neuroinvesting foundations is then crucial for making informed decisions and therefore better choices, which are consistent with investors' needs and expectations. This course aims to help participants to understand practical impacts and benefits that neuroscience applied to investments has on investors' decision-making processes. Starting from an overview about what neuroscience is and how brain activity can be measured, the course describes the underlying mechanisms related to motivations and to judgments under risk and uncertainty. The course focuses on the role of emotions and on investors' risk perception and risk tolerance. The course ends by introducing pathological choices, ethics, and trust.",

In the midst of such change and continuity, this course sets out to ask what place does Latinx occupy in this long history? What does Latinidad look like when we trace it back 530 years, when we take 1492 to be its starting point instead of the twentieth century? How might this look backwards help us understand the current Latinx politics of gender (Latino versus Latina versus Latinx), sexuality (the place of queerness and transness in Latinx studies), and race (Latinidad's penchant for disavowing blackness and erasing indigeneity)? We answer these questions as we move through different historical and literary periods in dialogue with writing by, for example, colonial Spanish historian Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, nineteenth-century Cuban intellect Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed from exile in New York, twentieth-century queer Chicana theorist Gloria Anzald\u00faa, and contemporary Honduran-Garifuna writer Janel Mart\u00ednez.",

This course begins by looking at the history of the term and its theoretical underpinnings, distinguishing it from related but nevertheless distinct forms of persuasive speech (for example, advertising, op-eds, and polemics) and obvious misinformation. Next, we examine various examples of propaganda and their manifestations, both historical as well as more contemporaneous (for example, World War I and World War II, Russian and Chinese troll farms, and the 2021 US Capitol riot).

From France's anti-immigrant National Front and neo-Nazis in Germany to efforts to rehabilitate Francisco Franco and Benito Mussolini in Spain and Italy, forces of extreme nationalism, xenophobia, and imperial nostalgia have increased in prominence as well as popularity. The current moment is not, of course, the first time that the continent has experienced a rise in right-wing extremism. Fascism, from the 1920s onward, likewise offered violent, totalitarian solutions to the tensions of mass politics and populist resentment in polarized societies. How, precisely, do today's reactionary political formations relate to their fascistic forebears? What social and cultural dynamics is each responding to and, perhaps just as significantly, what historical legacies are they drawing on? In this course, we ask how has the present wave of far-right parties in western and central Europe tapped into notions of national decline, instability, and changing demographics? What can we learn about these movements by studying histories of European fascism in France, Germany, Spain, and Italy? And finally, how have these histories been obscured and rehabilitated in different ways in each of these countries? By moving from contemporary cases of resurgent nationalist sentiment to their interwar predecessors and back again, and through a consideration of novels, films, historical documents, speeches, and monuments, the course seeks to uncover how anxieties of migration, race, and empire\u2014as well as changing roles of religion, gender, and nationhood\u2014shaped political animosities and allegiances within the European far right both a century ago and today.",

The Jewish presence in modern-day Spain and Portugal was established in antiquity and eliminated, violently and systematically, through the series of tribunals, expulsions, and mass conversions organized under the Inquisition. Although the language\u2014with its signature blend of Hispano-Romance and Hebraic elements\u2014disappeared from the Iberian Peninsula long ago, it lives on in the Sephardic diaspora, in Israel and, to a lesser extent, the United States as well as Turkey, where for centuries ancestrally Spanish and Portuguese Jews intermingled with their Ottoman hosts, acquiring numerous loanwords in the process. As its community of native speakers contracts, Judeo-Spanish today faces a future perhaps more uncertain than that which it faced on Iberian soil when the Inquisition began in 1492. Blending conventional coursework in language instruction with elements of literary and cultural studies, this course is a first experiment in reviving the language at home, in Cambridge. In class we explore a series of basic provocations about the nature of the language, including: just how capacious is the term Ladino? Is an <i>aljamiado</i> (that is, Hebrew-script) text in Spanish by default a Ladino text? What distinguishes, culturally and concretely, this language from Old Spanish and its modern descendants? In addition to supporting students' progress in reading, writing, and rudimentary oral and aural skills, the course attempts to trace the long line connecting us, as learners, to the Romance-speaking Jews of medieval Iberia\u2014and to appreciate the cultural artefacts by which that lineage is so spectacularly distinguished.",

In this course we explore a range of stories and different forms of storytelling on gender justice, from novels and films to memoirs and personal histories, histories, and creative nonfiction. Some narratives with which we engage are Margaret Atwood's <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>, Ito Shiori's <i>Black Box: The Memoir that Sparked Japan's #MeToo Movement</i>, Audre Lorde's <i>The Cancer Journals</i>, Cynthia Enloe's <i>The Big Push: Exposing and Challenging the Persistence of Patriarchy</i>, Cho Nam-joo's <i>Kim Ji-young, Born 1982</i>, and Cherrie Moraga and Gloria Anzald\u00faa's <i>This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color</i>. Students are also encouraged to write their own stories on gender and justice.",

We consider how pursuing the goals of better children, superior performance, ageless bodies, or happy souls might be aided or hindered, elevated or degraded, by seeking them through a wide variety of technological means.

What does our appeal to evil say about our sense of humanity, religion, and God? And how do we cope with suffering? This course takes up these questions through a variety of lenses drawn from Western thought: religious, philosophical, theological, and ethical. Readings include Jewish and Christian scriptures (the books of Genesis, Job, and Paul), classic theologians and philosophers (St. Augustine, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Immanuel Kant), novelists (Fyodor Dostoevsky and Annie Dillard), and contemporary critics (Susan Neiman, Hannah Arendt, and Haim Gouri).

How do these things happen? This course explores the psychological mechanisms that enable cults to form and to take things to such extremes. What do cults share with other groups (mainstream religions, nations, and everyday social interactions), and what makes them stand apart? In what ways are cults an environment in which many of our psychological tendencies (toward ingroup conformity, heuristic decision making, and rationalization) are magnified?

Topics such as generative AI and data privacy are explored in depth to demonstrate the necessity of the panoramic approach. Questions such as what is intelligence or what is privacy require philosophical contemplation, while assessing the impact of generative AI or means to protect individual privacy demand careful sociological, computational, and statistical thinking.

We consider major cities such as Kyiv, Odessa, Lviv, Kharkiv, and Dnipro, as well as Jewish shtetls and monuments of Soviet industrial sublime, such as the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station. We explore such topics as the reactionary responses to modernity ranging from anti-semitism to religious conservatism; the central role of the city and urbanization; making and unmaking of nationalities; public hygiene and the limits of control; revolutionary culture and artistic avant-garde; the long-lasting effects of wars and extreme violence on society; the curse of resources; and the rise of mass culture and sport, among others. Students learn why studying Ukraine is essential for our understanding of the modern world.",

At the present moment, however, it seems in many minds to have lost its evocative power as a collective myth. One wonders: does it still represent a principle of hope or has it become a form of cruel optimism? In a time of prolonged political and social crisis, this course has a pressing mission. It aims to further a dynamic understanding of American dreams (for there are many and not just one), to apprehend their complexities and contradictions, to appreciate their diverse manifestations and historical shapes, and above all to take measure of their presence and meaning in the world we now inhabit. To this end we study the variety of ways in which feature filmmakers, both in and outside of Hollywood studios, have created designs for living; indeed, the most influential and resonant incarnations of American dreams. We analyze popular narratives produced during crucial junctures in the modern history of the United States, from the Great Depression and World War II, through the cold war and the McCarthy era, up to the late 1960s. We consider the wide range of functions that these productions have assumed, how they have by turns sustained and questioned the status quo. In some instances they have interrogated, revealed, and even indicted social inequity, at other times they have legitimated injustice and fostered exclusion.",

Instead, they were emphasizing the great moderation, that is, the idea that business cycles had vanished for all practical purposes. These economists were wrong because they disregarded warning signs and used inadequate economic models to gauge the situation. Similarly, the COVID-19 recession occurred just at the time when pundits were boasting of a roaring economy.

Rapid economic growth, urbanization, and increasing population have resulted in an increase in resource consumption and the consequent generation of large amounts of waste. This generation of waste reflects a loss of materials and energy and imposes economic and environmental costs on society for its collection, management, and disposal. Of the 17 sustainable development goals of the United Nations, four are directly or partially related to waste management such as food waste, recycling, global carbon emissions, and the use of plastics. Traditional waste management options are chosen based on affordability, technical feasibility, and aesthetics. These options lack a holistic approach covering the whole chain of product design, raw material extraction, production, consumption, recycling, and waste management. Further, current waste management practices do not fully evaluate the ancillary human health and environmental impacts and the environmental equity of the chosen options. The recent detection of forever chemicals (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS) in waste threatens to disrupt most of the current waste management options. Although zero waste is an ambitious goal for many communities, currently, there is little evidence of decoupling of affluence and waste generation.",

Therefore, the course is focused on the governing structures through which actors inside and outside of the government attempt to gain, wield, and challenge power on climate policymaking. We explore theories and analytical frameworks from political science, public policy, and Chinese studies. We use these theoretical and analytical lenses to analyze ongoing and historical climate policy cases. This course helps students understand the institutions and key actors that influence climate policymaking and apply this knowledge to current cases. The first unit of the course focuses on the ideas of environmental issues. It explores the concepts behind climate politics, the economic and social factors that influence Chinese views about climate issues, and the governing systems that shape the distribution of resources and power in the climate policymaking process. The second unit examines the key actors and institutions involved in climate policymaking. It investigates how institutional incentives and governing structures shape key actors' involvement in the climate policy process. The third unit focuses on non-state actors, including environmental non-governmental organizations, expert communities, and international organizations. It examines the opportunities and challenges that non-state actors have encountered in the climate policymaking process. Each class begins with a discussion of the conceptual frameworks, which are then applied to explain ongoing cases, including those related to climate change. The goal of the discussions is to understand how theoretical and analytical frameworks can apply to case studies and how to choose a feasible framework to understand the political dynamics of Chinese climate policymaking and China's climate ambitions internationally and domestically.",

A single volcanic eruption off Tonga increased global atmospheric water vapor (our most abundant greenhouse gas) by five percent. Water became a weapon in the Ukrainian war. Insurance companies began pulling out of covering wildfire insurance as forests dried in the western United States, while updated flood insurance premiums skyrocketed nationally. All rainwater was discovered to contain dangerous levels of forever chemicals. Devastating floods submerged one-third of Pakistan underwater. And the United States, for the first time, declared water a national security priority. This course examines how rapid transformations in earth's hydrological cycle will transform humanity's relationship to its most precious resource in the decades to come. We start with an overview of the centrality of water to climate change, the orphaned status of water in climate policy and climate talks, the systemic problems that have produced this disconnect, the incentives that sustain it, and the conflicts that result. We then spend each class looking at a specific water development from the past five years that serve as the context for shaping our understanding of the social, political, environmental, and security dimensions of our changing water cycle. In the final stage of the course, students critique or devise novel interventions to emerging water problems using systems thinking, scenario planning, and stakeholder-centered design.",

The fourth industrial revolution, a fusion of cutting-edge technologies (for example, blockchain, artificial intelligence [AI], metaverse, internet-of-things, hyper-automation, digital twins, and big data) is blurring the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds. Thanks to the great accelerator of the COVID-19 pandemic, digitalization is increasingly ubiquitous in our daily life, defining how we work and radically disrupting how we do business. But such digital transformation carries its own risks and opportunities. The World Economic Forum estimates that digital technologies have the potential to save up to 20 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Yet, the rapid proliferation of digitalization has far-reaching negative impacts on the environment and society. The ever-growing carbon footprint of the digital sector (for example, hardware, software, networks, and data centers) is now larger than that of the aviation one. Similarly, the digital era has introduced a new wave of societal and ethical concerns arising from the adoption of such technologies. Further understanding of such risks is imperative to make digitalization sustainable in the future. This course introduces students to the sustainability challenges associated with digital technologies. We explore the environmentally and socially responsible use of digital technologies. Course topics include the evaluation of digital carbon footprints, the promise of clean AI, the need for energy-aware computing, the unsustainable role of digital assets (for example, cryptocurrency), the deepening of the digital divide, and the rising tide of climate change disinformation. The course also examines the taxonomy of digital justice, with a focus on ethical issues of emerging technologies. The course draws on case studies and contributions from active practitioners.

Sustainability challenges increasingly offer unparalleled opportunities for innovative solutions. This course guides students through the intricate process of transforming sustainability challenges into actionable projects or business opportunities. Through this journey, students craft sustainable ventures that prioritize environmental responsibility, financial sustainability, and meaningful global impact. This is a project-based course that melds entrepreneurial leadership with practical strategies tailored for sustainability. Students explore entrepreneurial leadership and mindset to understand the characteristics, motivations, and behaviors of entrepreneurs who emphasize sustainability. We cover marketing strategies for sustainability, which allow students to master market and consumer research, trend forecasting, and develop compelling marketing plans and messages tailored for sustainable ventures. Students learn to understand business structures in order to navigate the spectrum from for-profit corporations to social enterprises and charitable organizations, emphasizing the role of social entrepreneurship. We introduce the topic of impact measurement, so students recognize the importance of quantifying the social and environmental impact of ventures using industry-specific sustainability metrics. Emphasis is placed on vision, values, and high-performing teams, including how to establish a robust organizational vision, appreciate the role of values in guiding business actions, and learn the intricacies of building and engaging high-performing teams. Finally, we also cover financing and delve into the triple bottom line concept, exploring financing strategies that concurrently measure social, environmental, and financial impacts. This course is designed to amplify passion and knowledge, presenting students with a comprehensive framework that turns ideas into high-impact solutions.

In a future of climate-driven disasters, there is an even stronger imperative to consider the social, economic, and political frameworks that give rise to the conditions which presage disaster. Given that climate-driven disasters will invariably fall harder on the global south, we also face a rising moral imperative to consider how disaster prevention and response can either perpetuate or ameliorate longstanding issues of climate justice. The course begins with an overview of traditional top-down international disaster response frameworks beginning in the mid-twentieth century and charts the evolution of more grassroots, community-driven models. Students are asked to identify an issue of resilience or potential disaster from within their own communities and develop a speculative approach for its resolution. Students are asked to interview and liaise with individuals, groups, and businesses local to their community; diagram community dynamics; and crowd-source ideas for a more livable future. Students then work either on their own or in teams and extrapolate lessons learned in their own communities into a wider proposal for a new model for global disaster response, rooted in community-based practice.",

Through critical reading and presentation of research articles, students learn how to form questions that can be addressed experimentally and how to write a corresponding, testable hypothesis. The course also addresses the process of experimental design and current experimental methodologies in biology. Students are given multiple opportunities to hone their writing skills on several short writing assignments. Students are expected to participate in class discussions, present a paper to the class, and write a final research proposal due at the end of the semester. We focus our attention on innovations in genetics and genomics. Some background in these areas is beneficial but not required. Students learn to think scientifically while they gain knowledge of how recent advancements can be applied to agriculture, vaccine developments, personalized medicine, and other areas. Because skills learned in this course are useful in subsequent courses, it is the first course that prospective Master of Liberal Arts (ALM) candidates should take toward the degree (or the second, if they are completing the expository writing prerequisite). While not designed to be a thesis or capstone proposal course, this course does serve as a foundation for eventual work on the thesis or capstone.",

A major conclusion from those experiences is the conviction that we need to expand technologies that lead to effective vaccine nominations and development. This interactive, discussion-based course is designed to highlight the most recent advances in immunology, microbiology, and vaccinology regarding new vaccine developments. The focus of the course is to understand how vaccines against bacterial pathogens were developed in the past and what improvements can be implemented today. Using real-life clinical cases, we make connections between disease manifestations, cellular responses, immunity, and infection. We cover general principles of vaccinology and discuss examples of successful vaccines that were produced using reverse vaccinology approaches. For example, we discuss how a serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis was discovered and why it is efficacious. We also talk about one of the oldest vaccines in the world, bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and define its protective efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and cross-protection offered against SARS-CoV-2. We discuss why there are no currently available vaccines against pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or E. coli. Students learn to understand results from past and ongoing clinical trials where vaccines targeting difficult-to-handle pathogens are evaluated. We talk about the importance of machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches to developing new vaccines. Finally, we discuss how advancements in sciences are translated in the budding of new biotech start-ups and spin-offs, which offer new approaches for vaccine development.

Yet the dominant economic growth model in rich and poor nations has created a global climate crisis. The course explores the promise of sustainable development that integrates natural and social science concerns, and reviews failures of sustainability that have at times increased landlessness, disease, hunger, pollution, and social disintegration. We examine principles and best practices in development and learn underlying concepts in population dynamics, poverty reduction, public health, and technology innovation to meet critical needs in energy and food security. Case studies help us learn the importance of methods for planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Students are introduced to the institutional landscape for development assistance including multilateral agencies such as the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the New Development Bank; bilateral agencies as the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA); nongovernmental organizations as Oxfam, the Aga Khan Development Network, BRAC; and social movements for development and peace such as Sarvodaya Shramadana. The course aims to benefit students seeking a foundation in development as well as those wishing to enhance skills in policy advocacy.

These efforts, often driven by grassroots activism, offer valuable lessons for transforming the places we live. This course focuses on the unique ways in which US cities are working to mitigate and adapt to climate change while creating equitable and livable communities in the process. Four main themes and twelve case studies show how US cities are reclaiming their streets from cars, restoring watersheds, growing forests, and adapting shorelines to improve people's lives while addressing our changing climate. The course relates national models to field study in Boston and Cambridge, where we meet with local advocates, community groups, government officials, scientists, and urban designers. Students walk the Rose Kennedy Greenway and visit the site of the Big Dig to learn how Boston buried an interstate highway and built a world-class park over it. We ride the region's evolving bike network, featuring paths that are among the best in the country, and meet with city transportation planners to better understand how bike and scooter shares are complimenting public transit. Tours focus on the ways in which Boston's efforts to make its streets safer are also a part of its green infrastructure plans to manage stormwater. We examine Boston's tree canopy, observing how disparities in urban trees correlate to race and income and, subsequently, inequities in exposure to air pollution and extreme heat. We paddle the Charles River and learn about how the Resilient Boston Harbor Plan aims to protect the city from sea-level rise and storm surge by creating green spaces along the city's 75 kilometer shoreline. Class assignments engage students in researching, measuring, and engaging in individual and group projects related to the themes of the course.

Given this, creativity has become as important as literacy. Whether operating in the corporate, startup, social entrepreneurship, not-for-profit, or public sectors, organizations increasingly need people who understand the creative process; know how to manage, motivate, and engage creative professionals; and can develop an organizational culture that encourages experimentation, considers the inevitable failures as learning opportunities, and enables innovative outcomes. This course focuses on best practices in creativity and innovation, exploring the interplay between creativity, organizational processes and systems, and successful innovation. Throughout the course we explore tools and techniques for fostering individual and group creativity, management practices that foster (or inhibit) innovation, methods for developing and evaluating ideas for new products and services, the business models to execute these ideas, and principles and practices for leading innovation.

We include the obvious connections between fundraising and membership to attendance and social media. We also take a deep look at collections management systems to see patterns of giving that may be leveraged if connections were made to other data. We look at this information from the perspective of the museum educator. Assembling information on programs offered, attendance, and evaluations informs current and future programs and ensures their success. However, big data goes beyond bringing information about constituents and visitors together. Digitizing historical collections allows researchers to analyze the information in field notes, specimen records, and the scientific analysis conducted during the field work. Trends can be measured and compared to current data, giving scientists access to information that may be hidden in the paper records.

In the past several decades, exciting new discoveries on the neurobiology of sleep have been facilitated by technologies such as functional neuroimaging and molecular genetics. Nonetheless, sleep remains mysterious and controversial and, remarkably, there still is no generally agreed upon function for this behavioral state that occupies one third of our lives. Importantly, sleep science exemplifies the translational approach in biomedical science whereby human and animal research together continually advance the field of sleep medicine. Following an overview on the physiology and behavioral neuroscience of sleep, students choose a topic related to the effects of sleep on mental health to research in depth, to present to the class, and to discuss in a term paper. Topics might include the characteristic abnormalities in sleep occurring in mood, anxiety, psychotic, addictive, autism spectrum, or neurodegenerative disorders. Such changes are increasingly seen as bidirectional, with sleep disturbances contributing to the waking symptoms of these mental disorders. Other topics might focus on the contribution of primary sleep disorders to psychiatric and neurological illness such as the linkage between sleep apnea and depression, circadian rhythm disorders in bipolar illness, insomnia as a risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders, or contribution of nocturnal seizures to neurodevelopmental disorders. Still other topics may focus on the contribution of normal sleep to emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and human performance factors. For those with more neuroscientific interests, topics might include neuroimaging of cognitive functioning following sleep deprivation or the growing interest in trafficking and disposal of abnormal proteins during sleep having a potential role in neurodegenerative illness.",

        "course_description": "Karl Marx famously wrote that with the advance of capitalist social relations, &quot;all that is solid melts into air.&quot; Here Marx refers to the supposed power of capitalism to destroy pre-existing economic, social, and cultural orders. In the centuries since capitalism spread over the globe, it has indeed transformed the lifeways and cultures of peoples throughout the world. In more recent years, globalization\u2014understood as the widespread and accelerated movement of capital across national borders\u2014has radically altered the lives of many peoples, from peasants in China to industrial workers in Michigan. This course critically examines capitalism historically and ethnographically. In the first part of the course, we consider historical accounts of the origins, development, and transformation of American capitalism, focusing on the key themes of slavery, industrialization, and financialization. In the second part of the course, we consider ethnographic accounts of life under contemporary capitalism, focusing on the cultural responses of peoples experiencing the rapid social change, dislocation, opportunities, and hardships brought about by changing capitalist social relations. We consider questions such as how have people coped culturally with the demands of capitalist wage labor and work discipline? How have capitalist social relations transformed communities, families, and senses of ethnic and national identity?

But for players and spectators alike, play often entails considerable commitments, including substantial expenditures of time and money. Thus, despite common assumptions about its frivolity, play is in many senses serious, with social, economic, and political consequences as well as symbolic and experiential import. In this course, we explore what activities labeled play reveal about the cultures and peoples who take part in them, analyzing how everyday practices involving toys, games, and sports might illuminate broader social realities. Our discussions move us through a range of the anthropology's subfields, from ritual studies to globalization, and from political and economic anthropology to studies of the body, gender, and sexuality. Some of our discussion topics include Olympic games and nationalism, dolls and the gendering of bodies, internet avatars and social constructions of the self, individualist ideology, and team spirit.",

Restless spirits, alien invaders, wicked witches, bloodthirsty vampires, legendary cryptids, murderous ogres, illuminati satanists, deep-state conspirators, memetic online menaces: our contemporary bestiary is overflowing with meaningful monsters. Our spine-tingling intellectual task in this course is to analyze the roles that these malevolent entities and the supernatural narratives we tell about them play in our everyday lives, collective psyches, communities, and politics, and in the crises we confront as individuals and groups. Are our occult stories allegories of our modern discontents or simply holdovers from our childhood nightmares? Are they symptoms of specific societal crises or representations of timeless pan-human fears? How has the witch hunt, the rumor panic, the standardized nightmare of the group transformed in this meme-ified age of online participatory culture, global interconnection, ecological catastrophe, and fake-news-driven conspiracy thinking? What can we learn about ourselves, our pasts, and our futures by thinking deeply about what scares us the most? And how frightened should we be of what we might find if we dig too deeply into that question? We analyze the supernatural in relationship historical memories, cultural anxieties, folk traditions, spiritual beliefs, physiological sensations, political conflicts, environmental disasters, and existential imperatives.

Making matters worse, understanding the crisis in real time is notoriously difficult, especially since most who overdose do not go to hospitals and death certificates are often unreliable. And while everyone agrees something must be done, what that something is leads us into heated debates over health care spending and harm reduction. While most medical research focuses on the biology of disease, this course takes a biosocial approach to unmask how social factors, economic insecurity, and the availability of massive amounts of pharmaceuticals have become an overdose crisis. We read social scientists, journalists, public health scholars, and first-hand accounts in order to understand the chronic emergencies (such as de-industrialization and despair) behind this acute crisis. By investigating the opioid epidemic in this way, students are encouraged to think boldly and creatively beyond the traditional boundaries of medicine: perhaps someone's best medicine is a housing voucher, or a testing strip to detect fentanyl. By the end of the course, students understand the social roots of the opioid epidemic and how solutions may be implemented.",

We explore how similar design principles appear across various biological systems and scales. For example, the negative feedback motif is present at the cellular scale (in gene regulatory networks), at the organismal scale (in glucose homeostasis), and at the ecological scale (through predator-prey dynamics).

In this course, we consider such possible beyond therapy uses and explore both their scientific basis and the ethical and social issues they are likely to raise. We consider how pursuing the goals of better children, superior performance, ageless bodies, or happy souls might be aided or hindered, elevated or degraded, by seeking them through a wide variety of technological means. Among the biotechnological techniques considered are techniques for screening genes and testing embryos, choosing sex of children, modifying the behavior of children, augmenting muscle size and strength, enhancing athletic performance, slowing senescence, blunting painful memories, brightening mood, and altering basic temperaments.

How is this possible? More computing power? Intensive application-specific engineering? While these certainly have had a role to play, in this course, students are exposed to and learn how to use general algorithm design principles that cut across application domains and remain relevant even as computing technology changes. First among these principles is mathematical abstraction, whereby we capture the essence of a computational problem (as well as the notion of what a computer is) so that we can develop and analyze solutions independent of an implementation. Given these mathematical abstractions, we can apply a toolkit of basic algorithmic techniques in the search for solutions and then gain certainty in their correctness and efficiency through rigorous mathematical proofs. Furthermore, the powerful concept of reductions allows us to identify relationships between computational problems that seem very different on the surface and thus automatically transfer solutions from one to another. At the same time, some important computational problems have defied the search for algorithmic solutions. Computer scientists would love to have debugging tools that determine whether their programs can crash, natural scientists would love to have simulators that quickly determine the energy-minimizing states of physical or biological systems, and university registrars would love to be able to automatically schedule classes in a way that optimally maximizes the use of the best classrooms. Why have no scalable algorithms been found for these problems? In the last part of the course, students learn that many important computational problems are inherently unsolvable\u2014they have no general algorithmic solution whatsoever. Others are solvable, but have no efficient algorithm\u2014the minimum computation time inherently grows exponentially with the size of the problem instance. Uncovering these phenomena (known as uncomputability and intractability, respectively) are unique benefits of a mathematically rigorous approach to algorithms. While we may sometimes be satisfied with empirical demonstrations of the performance of an algorithm we have found, a proof seems to be the only way to convince ourselves that there is no algorithm whatsoever. This course aims to give students the power of using mathematical abstraction and rigorous proof to understand computation. Thus equipped, students are able to design and use algorithms that apply to a wide variety of computational problems with confidence about their correctness and efficiency, as well as recognize when a problem may have no algorithmic solution. At the same time, students may gain an appreciation for the beautiful mathematical theory of computation that is independent of (indeed, predates) the technology on which it is implemented.",

This gap extends into strategic program design; it is not uncommon that the logic driving global sustainable development initiatives are not based upon a deep analysis of the actual context, but rather reflect the biases and assumptions of project planners and the organizations they represent. Overcoming these biases and assumptions requires intentional methods to foster discussions between planners and stakeholders. Theory of change mapping has emerged as a powerful tool for teams to work through these limitations. This course serves as a workshop for student practitioners to draw on their academic, lived, and professional experiences to explore how they can construct collaborative methods for mapping long-term change in complex social and environmental situations and at project, program, and policy levels.

The course is helpful to students who wish to explore digital photography as a way to document their field work and other work in progress and enhance their visual literacy, enabling them to assess images and other visual media. Students are taught Lightroom to manage their digital archives and learn to use editing techniques to enhance their images. Coursework is structured along two main components: technical mastery and aesthetic development. During the semester students are first taught the technical skills which they then apply in practical exercises to consolidate those skills. Upon completion of this course, students are expected to have mastered their camera and their images should look more polished. Students have the option to create a learning portfolio to present their work.",

We look at photographic books with the goals of expanding students' approaches, techniques, and aesthetic possibilities for their semester-long projects. The course constantly refers to the software tools we use to ensure reliable workflow and archive management. It addresses advanced color management as well as the science of converting images from color to black and white. Through lectures, hands-on assignments, and critiques, students expand their understanding of digital photography while exploring their creativity to broaden the possibilities and improve the quality of their photographs. Documentary photography and long-form photojournalism predominate, but we also explore art. This is a bridging course between accidental art while doing documentary work and art for art's sake. We look at various types of photography that are defined or self-defined as art. We dive into portraiture outside of the studio, shooting stories involving people and discussing how to get the picture when everyone does not want you to. This course explores conflict and documentary photography extensively, with an emphasis on narrative photography, but it does not preclude students from any genre of photography they wish to pursue. The goal of the course is for each student to produce a body of work or a photographic essay in electronic book form. The skill of editing one's own work is a key learning goal.",

The economist John Maynard Keynes wrote that, &quot;the ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood.&quot; Economics is not primarily a set of answers, but rather a method of reasoning. By the end of the semester, students are able to use the analysis practiced in the course to form their own judgments about many of the major economic problems faced by the United States and other countries. In the first part of the semester, we focus on microeconomics, which is the study of the interaction of people and firms in markets. Since we live in a market economy, this study helps students to understand how American society organizes its economic affairs. We examine how the forces of supply and demand operate in the markets for goods and services. Students learn powerful tools that enable them to understand a great deal about the economy and how it works. Using these tools, we develop a framework to evaluate social policies. Trade\u2014always a controversial subject\u2014is analyzed, along with measures, such as tariffs, designed to restrict trade. Theories concerning firm behavior are then examined\u2014how companies decide how much to produce, and the profits which result.

In the microeconomic portion of the course, we examine exactly how prices are determined in competitive markets and what can distort that determination. Market structure is analyzed, including the fundamentals of firm pricing and production decisions. Using examples from various industries, we analyze what happens when market conditions change. Furthermore, we examine how these changes affect overall social welfare. Issues concerning trade are addressed, for example, when should countries, or even individuals, trade? Who gains or loses from trade? Turning to macroeconomics, we investigate the key economic statistics that you read about in the business press and other media, such as gross domestic product (GDP), the consumer price index (CPI), and the unemployment rate. For so many around the world, economic development is literally a matter of life and death. While economic growth is primarily a long-run phenomenon, short-run fluctuations in the economy\u2014cycles of expansion and recession\u2014are often the focus of short-run planning decisions by consumers, firms, and government. We examine in detail what causes these fluctuations and how government policies\u2014monetary and fiscal policy\u2014can dampen these cycles. An understanding of the Federal Reserve and monetary policy must be predicated on an understanding of the banking and financial system. Therefore, we delve into that in the course of our study of actions by the monetary authority. Recent events have also thrust fiscal policy to the fore. We talk in detail about how fiscal policy works and its implications for the economy in both the short and long term. Economics is not primarily a set of answers, but rather a method of reasoning. By the end of the course, students are able to use the framework they have learned to form their own judgments about the major economic problems faced by the United States and other countries. Indeed, after completing the course, students often find that they are better able to read and interpret the business press and other media and are better equipped to evaluate the economic policies promulgated by governments and other institutions.

The focus is on understanding the way the economy works in the real world without relying excessively on assumptions, math, or abstract models of the economy. We use the inductive method, which means that we consider the evidence first and then infer from the data how people actually behave in real markets where asymmetric information, bounded rationality, transaction costs, and uneven distribution of power dominates. We apply the concepts we learn to contemporary controversial topics such as minimum wage legislation, the function of unions, and why the free market overcharges for health care. We explore why Noble Prize-winning economists such as Paul Krugman and Joe Stiglitz are so critical of the current economic situation for its dizzying inequality, its endemic underemployment, the humongous trade and government deficits, stagnating wages, the lack of inclusive growth, and its inability to provide a dignified life for dozens of millions of its citizens. Most economists do not have the answers to the challenges of globalization, inequality, and technological unemployment because they are unable to think creatively about new institutional structures that would enable us to transition to a full-employment economy in which the focus is not on production and consumption as much as on the achievement of a high quality of life in capitalism with a human face. In contrast, this course weaves ideas from history, psychology, sociology, and political science into a common-sense economic perspective in order to explore these issues. We also discuss the achievements of Nobel Prize-winning behavioral economists and the impact of the financial crisis of 2008, the economic roots of the rise of populism, and ends by outlining the main impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In this time of climate change and ecological degradation, a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions and damage to ecosystems can be traced back to the way in which humans produce food, feed, fuel, and fiber. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that 10-12 percent of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are due to agriculture. Agriculture is also tied to ecological degradation including deforestation, depletion and contamination of water and soil resources, and chemical pollution. However, many individuals and organizations are discovering innovative and tailored solutions to these problems. Addressing the ecological and climate change challenges of agriculture in the next ten years will be essential to ensure a meaningful reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and to creating resilient production systems.

Combined, they contribute 50 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) that cause climate change. Therefore, decarbonizing power and transportation is inextricably linked to mitigating climate change. The objective is straightforward: transition to zero-emissions sources while limiting cost impacts to customers, maintaining reliability, and expanding accessibility, all while adjusting to local market dynamics across the United States and around the world. Though this may sound simple, there is an underlying complexity that must be unpacked before these changes can occur at the necessary pace. The good news is that the transition to cleaner sources is happening now. For a centuries-old industry, there are structural, market, financial, and policy dynamics to challenge in order to achieve this transition. This course examines the robust ecosystem of energy companies, investors, regulators, and customers that comprise the power and transportation sectors. The primary goal of the course is to understand the unique structures, markets, and regulations influencing the energy industry in order to accelerate the transition from the old model to a new model in response to cleaner technologies and innovations\u2014without destabilizing its reliability as the backbone of modern society. Some of the key questions that are addressed include: what are the unique dynamics of the power sector? How do they differ from the structure, markets, and policy that govern the transportation sector? How do these unique structures, markets, financial risks, and regulatory oversights dictate the renewable options available to each sector? How can government policy shape this outcome? And perhaps most importantly, how do financial considerations and investors shape this transition?",

These ecosystems and specific sites exemplify different challenges but similar ecological processes at work for successful management, whether the goal is protection of natural systems and biodiversity, ecological restoration, or maintaining ecosystem services in agricultural and other human-dominated landscapes. Through this approach, the fundamental topics covered in typical ecology courses are exemplified. The historical, evolutionary, and ecological processes determining the distribution of ecosystems, habitats, and species are introduced. Evolutionary processes responsible for the adaptations of individuals are examined to understand the diversity of species and their features. Ecological processes of competition, predation, disease, and mutualism help explain the functioning of biological communities and larger ecosystems. Among other activities, teams of students conduct background research on specific ecosystem sites to understand the ecological, economic, sociocultural, and multistakeholder context of sustainability challenges and integrated solutions.",

        "course_description": "This course gives students the essential concepts, tools, and skills needed to take part in the transition to a circular economy in a wide variety of economic sectors and areas of human activity. Ecosystems tend toward a stable equilibrium, or homeostasis, and have the ability to regenerate and thrive for thousands of years. Likewise, the circular economy seeks to maintain the value and preserve the stocks of materials, components, and goods, while eliminating waste and pollution and restoring natural capital. The circular economy allows for a better economic and ecological performance than today's prevailing economy\u2014which follows a take-make-waste linear model that destroys value, depletes stocks, and degrades living systems. The transition to a circular economy is mandated by the ecological and physical boundaries of our planet. Without an accelerated transition it will be impossible to meet the Paris Agreement targets. At the same time, the transition to a circular economy is a tremendous opportunity that would unleash global economic growth and create an estimated 95 million new jobs worldwide while also boosting economic resilience. The European Union, Canada, China, and other leading economies have outlined aggressive roadmaps towards a circular economy. In the United States, 60 percent of chief executive officers plan to transition to a circular economy framework. This course challenges not only what, but how students think about sustainability. Students are encouraged to think in systems and material flows, while embracing a radical collaboration mindset. Along the way we visit different areas of opportunity that range from biomass management to industrial symbiosis; examine circularity in sectors as diverse as food, electronics, and plastics; outline the role of related disciplines such as biomimicry and permaculture; and discuss innovative business models where products are servitized, dematerialized, and completely redesigned to foster modularity, repairability, upgradeability, and cradle-to-cradle life cycles.",

Changes now occurring on the national and global levels, such as those wrought by the pandemic and by the rising movement for social justice, are explored through lectures, readings, and student work. From a sustainability perspective, the nexus of energy consumption, vehicle emissions, climate change, habitat loss or alteration, and air quality are explored to understand the impacts of various forms of transportation and the potential utilization of emerging technologies and new policies and institutional structures to dramatically improve results. Looking beyond current practices, we also explore how more fundamental shifts, such as in consumer habits, are reshaping transportation networks and the infrastructure barriers that we must address. Finally, we examine the role of legal and regulatory actions on transportation/environmental relationships at the state and federal levels, and how future standards could be utilized to advance sustainability.",

We are experiencing the stark challenge of shifting the cultural and economic drivers of unsustainable patterns of living on the land at a time of a deep ideological divide in our democratic institutions. This divide is interfering with the ability of our elected leaders to develop long-term, systemic strategies for change. On the other hand, we have a better societal understanding of the risks of failing to address the unsustainability of the ways that humans are currently living on our planet. In response, local, state, tribal, and national-level leaders are open to new policy approaches, giving rise to the opportunity for environmental professionals to participate in the development of improved systems. In this course, we explore the ways that the United States has made important progress in addressing many environmental problems through its laws and policies. However, this exploration also reveals that those solutions have tended to exist in isolation, not addressing or perhaps masking larger system declines that we can see in the form of climate change, loss of biodiversity, inequitable allocation of the benefits and burdens of environmental degradation, and permanent disruption to the ability of the land, air, and water to regenerate. The fact that these trends are not abating in response to the strategies employed over the past fifty years of the modern American environmental movement suggests a need to explore what has worked, what has not worked, and how we view our current challenges through an ecological lens in order to adjust our strategy in response to that knowledge. Students in this course explore the major areas of US environmental and natural resources law and policy, with a focus on the areas of water quality and quantity, biodiversity, hazardous waste and toxic substances, and land use. Students review examples that demonstrate the interplay of local, state, tribal, and federal governmental decision-making processes. In addition, students gain experience in reading case law, statutes, and regulations, as well as policy analyses. Finally, students are invited to bring their own personal and professional experiences to bear as we explore the importance of collaboration and interdisciplinary thinking to solve complex environmental issues.",

Computational modeling tools have allowed for more dynamic and accurate predictions of complex environmental and ecological systems, though simulation output is only as valid as the quality of the input data. Analyzing the integrity of measurement scenarios is critical; what omissions and limitations might bias an outcome, and how might human behavioral interactions cause scenario modeling to differ from quantitative predictions? To learn these skills, students enrolled in this course conduct practical exercises illustrating a range of measurement and modeling techniques, including statistical analysis of ecological and environmental data and system dynamics modeling. Building on these methods, skill development also includes scientific writing, critiquing primary research literature, negotiating environmental resource rights, and accurately communicating environmental science in non-technical language. Course activities are rooted in core issues of environmental and sustainability sciences, climate change, human population dynamics, population viability analysis of endangered species, economic appraisal of projects that impact natural resources, impacts of built and natural environments on human health, and climate justice.

The course sets the stage with a brief history of data and tools developed over time to implement a sustainable business strategy and investment decisions. Students learn about the voluntary frameworks that guide corporate sustainability reporting, including Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and International Sustainability Standards Board (IFRS), and the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The limitations of voluntary self-disclosure are debated within the context of greenwashing criticism and investor confidence in ESG data. Recent global movements to mandated standardized disclosure in the European Union, China, California, and other jurisdictions are creating a paradigm shift, which will increase requirements of corporate disclosure. Students learn about ESG ratings, their history, utility for corporate strategy and investment decisions, and limits to accuracy. Recent pushback amid concerns about transparency and quality has led to regulatory scrutiny of ESG ratings, green bonds, and net-zero target setting. Students are introduced to impact measurement and to asset-level ESG risk analysis, an emerging discipline in sustainable finance. Students learn about various roles in the sustainability reporting ecosystem, from corporate to investor perspectives, and the ESG tools and data used by each role. Students' experiential learning includes comparing mandated to voluntary disclosures and the ability of investors to build credible investment products with the data available. Students have the choice to develop an approach to net-zero targets that is scientifically credible and technologically feasible or to develop a sustainable investment strategy that creatively uses data available with a specific sustainability goal (ESG integration, ESG engagement, or sustainable impact).",

The course next addresses basic bargaining theory, which uses insights from economics to explore how bargaining breakdowns, commitment problems, and incomplete information can lead to war. Thereafter we examine three popular topics in contemporary international relations research: the roles that psychology, leaders, and domestic politics play in explaining international conflict and cooperation. We also explore the sources and effects of international institutions such as the United Nations and World Trade Organization. We spend a week studying terrorism, a problem of particular significance in the modern world. We also look at trade, foreign aid, international development, and climate change. We conclude with international law and an exploration of the future of international relations.",

Democracy has come to many different lands in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries, but its record of success once there has been remarkably variable. Consequently, we ask two interrelated questions, drawing upon both theoretical literature and case studies: what conditions are propitious or deleterious for democratic consolidation? And, in the latter instance, are there ways of overcoming less than ideal starting points? Posing these questions requires distinguishing between the process of democratization and the outcome of a stable, well-functioning democratic regime. In doing so, we examine problematic cases, historic and contemporary, where democracy has survived and thrived despite the initial odds (India, Germany). We also look at democratic reversals, where hopes of competitive elections and representative governance have been thwarted (Russia). The point of doing so is to have students think critically about democratic theory and regime change in order to assess events such as the Arab Spring and evaluate what factors are unfavorable to democracy (and why), as well as whether these might be overcome through institutional design or other means.",

During this period new states emerged, disappeared, and re-emerged in the region. Democratic, fascist, and communist regimes were established and dismantled. Economic systems were destroyed and rebuilt. Countries experienced wars, foreign invasions, revolutions and civil wars, state- and nation-building processes, economic and political crises, rapid social and cultural transformations, and modernization. This course examines critical periods in central and east European history and politics: the emergence and experiences of newly restored independent states in the aftermath of the First World War, the devastations of the Second World War and subsequent imposition of communist regimes, their evolution and their rapid and largely unanticipated collapse in 1989, subsequent transitions to democracy and a market economy, the accession to the European Union (EU) and the recent slowdown in economic reforms, democratic backsliding, the largely unexpected authoritarian turn in some of the new EU member states and Russian invasion of Ukraine. The course is designed to provide a general introduction to central and east European politics; survey existing interpretations of social, political and economic developments in the region; and examine these developments within the framework of the contemporary literature in comparative politics.",

The course is divided into two sections. The first section covers the period from the end of the last imperial dynasty to the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976. The second section examines the last 40 years of economic reform, looking at both how the reforms began and how they were sustained.

According to recent projections, Africa will account for more than half of global population growth in the coming decades, doubling its current population of 1.2 billion people by the year 2050. With rapid urbanization across the continent, Africa is primed to become a key player in the global economic order and the center of the world's urban megalopolises. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to wide-ranging issues that shape contemporary politics in Africa. To understand the complexity of cultures and dynamic social structures, the nature and development of political systems on the continent, Africa's place in the geopolitical arena, and the economic prospects for individual nations and the continent as a whole, we critically explore issues related to group identity and social cohesion, examine pre-colonial structures, European colonialism and imperialism, and legacies of colonialism, and evaluate how post-colonial states have grappled with democratization, nation-building, political violence, conflict, and security issues. The following guiding questions frame our study of African politics: how has Africa been shaped by colonialism and its legacies? What factors drive economic growth and development on the continent? What accounts for the relatively high levels of political violence in some African states? What are the socioeconomic and political prospects for shaping Africa's future? To answer these questions, we examine broad patterns across the continent and consider the political, economic, and social contexts in individual countries. Key thematic areas that are the foundation for this course are pre-colonial political structures; European colonialism and imperialism; nationalism and decolonization; race and ethnic identity; gender politics in Africa; neocolonialism and African economy; ethnic conflict and violence; post-conflict reconstruction; democratization; transitional justice in Africa; Africa in the geopolitical arena; diaspora and transnational solidarity; and economic dimensions of African politics.

We discuss cybersecurity and cyber warfare, examining the increasing role of cyberspace in geopolitical strategies, including cyber espionage, cyber warfare, and information warfare. The course explores how nations protect their digital infrastructure and the implications of cyber attacks on national security and international relations. We devote time to examining digital sovereignty and internet governance, investigating how countries are asserting control over their digital spaces, the fragmentation of the internet, and the battle for control over data flows and digital infrastructure. We analyze how technology is at the forefront of trade wars and economic competitions, including issues related to technology transfer, intellectual property rights, and the race for technological supremacy in fields like artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and 5G internet. The course delves into the geopolitical implications of surveillance technologies and data collection practices, includes state surveillance for national security, the role of technology companies in data collection, and the impact on privacy and human rights. We explore how technological developments lead to the formation of new alliances and rivalries, both among states and between states and non-state actors. This includes technology-sharing agreements, standards-setting bodies, and the geopolitics of technology supply chains. Time is spent assessing how emerging technologies like autonomous weapons systems, drones, and AI are changing the nature of warfare and defense strategies. The course explores the ethical, strategic, and operational implications of these technologies. Finally, we cover the impact of technology on global issues by investigating how technology can both exacerbate and solve global challenges such as climate change, pandemics, and humanitarian crises.

Next, we examine various examples of propaganda and their manifestations, both historical as well as more contemporaneous (for example, World War I and World War II, Russian and Chinese troll farms, and the 2021 United States Capitol riot).

In this course, we explore the history and evolution of nuclear weapons, the strategic and political implications of nuclear deterrence, and current efforts to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons. The course begina with a brief history of the development of nuclear weapons, including the Manhattan Project and the events leading up to their deployment during World War II. We also examine the cold war arms race, including the strategy of mutual assured destruction (MAD), and the impact of nuclear weapons on international relations. Next, we focus on the political and strategic implications of nuclear deterrence. We explore the ways in which nuclear weapons have influenced state behavior, including their role in preventing major wars between nuclear-armed states. We also examine the impact of nuclear weapons on regional and global security, including the potential for nuclear escalation and the spread of nuclear weapons to other states. The course examines in particular the evolving relation between the United States and the Russian Federation, the expanding nuclear arsenal of China, the North Korea threat, and the proliferation risks of Iran. We also discuss possible escalation risks between India and Pakistan and explore how Taiwan and Ukraine might both lead to dangerous confrontations among major nuclear players. In addition to discussing the historical and political aspects of nuclear weapons, the course also examines current efforts to reduce and eliminate them. This includes a discussion of arms control and disarmament negotiations, such as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), as well as non-proliferation efforts aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to new states. Throughout the course, we also consider the ethical and moral dimensions of nuclear weapons, including the debate over just war theory and the humanitarian consequences of their use. This includes an examination of the arguments for and against nuclear deterrence and the role of civil society in shaping public opinion on nuclear weapons.",

This course examines the foundational concepts of deterrence theory and how that theory has evolved since 1945, with a particular emphasis on how theory has informed practitioners\u2014both military and civilian\u2014who manage the nuclear enterprise. In addition, we consider the application of deterrence to international security in the cold war and post-cold war years. Finally, we assess current nuclear arsenals and strategy along with the role deterrence continues to play in the future of nuclear weapons, as well as application of deterrence theory to non-nuclear strategic weapons.

The course endeavors to better understand how policymakers and practitioners use research evidence and how researchers can increase the likelihood that their own work can reach audiences outside of the academy. Throughout the course, students learn how to write, engage, and communicate scholarly research with diverse audiences outside of academia. Students gain subject-matter expertise in the study of how research evidence is used in policymaking. Each week, we examine debates from the use of research evidence field to hone our own knowledge and expertise. Guest lectures from scholars and policymakers give us a first-hand opportunity to learn and ask questions. Then, students write one work of scholarly translation for a policy audience: either a policy brief or a research-based op-ed. Although students pick just one to write for the final assignment, every student learns how to write both a policy brief and an op-ed.

What is much less well understood are his extensive connections with American patrons, collectors, museums, and artists. Unlike his great contemporary Pablo Picasso, Matisse visited this country several times, lending his celebrity to exhibitions and publications and expressing admiration for various aspects of American life. His work also attracted much attention from American critics beginning with the 1913 Armory Show, and this intensified from the 1930s onward. He also inspired attention from important artists here early and late, from Max Weber (d. 1961) to Richard Diebenkorn (d. 1993) and Roy Lichtenstein (d. 1997). In effect, Matisse's relationship with America was one of reciprocity, in which Americans figured decisively in within the development of his career, and his art in turn influenced the history of modernism in the United States. This course focuses on these areas of Matisse's achievement, examining their role in his personal development as well as the richness they brought to our own cultural history.",

Students also have multiple opportunities for putting their oral history training into practice. The first half of the course is focused on student engagement with oral history theory and scholarship alongside existing oral history collections (as primary sources) toward developing an understanding of the field and studying various models for doing oral history. In the second half of the course, students develop and execute an oral history project that involves background research, research design, interviewing (with digital recording), transcription, and presentation of research findings in both oral and written formats. Over the semester, students learn how to incorporate oral histories into their research, with attention to research ethics and an understanding that oral history research cannot be conducted independently of other methods of historical research.

From the literally devastated landscape of August 1945\u2014cities destroyed by firebombs and atomic bombs, a countryside deforested by wartime demand for resources\u2014the nation has been likened to the mythical phoenix rising from the ashes. Japan became a global economic power by the 1970s, for several decades boasting the world's second largest economy. It came to boast a large and optimistic middle class, and a self-understanding as an unusually successful society. Then, from the 1990s, the stock market crashed, the economy stagnated, the population began to decline, social inequality increased, and a self-understanding of loss set in, encapsulated by the catchphrase lost decades. The natural catastrophe of one of history's largest earthquakes then brought on social and environmental disaster whose consequences are still unfolding. The years of economic growth and growing national power came at high cost for many people\u2014and the natural environment. The years of apparent stagnation possibly offer global lessons for realizing a sustainable future. Across the entire postwar era, explaining and taking responsibility for the previous embrace of empire and war proved divisive in Japan, and increasingly set the Japanese government against other nations. In this course we seek to understand the value and the limits of the narratives of rise and fall. We focus on two sorts of diversity: the wide range of experience and understandings held by historical actors themselves and the varied opinions of historians seeking to make sense of the past. We give attention to differences of city and country, and of gender and social class within Japan, and to divergent understandings of Japan's modern past both inside Japan, and between people in Japan and in other nations.",

Combining historical and cultural studies approaches, we engage with the tumultuous history of the 1960s by looking at the intersection of popular music, freedom songs, and the conditions that led to profound social changes. We explore journalism, film, scholarly, and creative literature to explore what happened, what was said to have happened, and how music informed the unfolding events and currents of the time. We explore the dialectic of politics and music, knowing that songs such as &quot;Go Tell It On the Mountain&quot; and &quot;Motor City Burning&quot; reported on events, responded to events, shaped events, and entertained the masses along the way. The music of the 1960s incorporated Afro-American rhythms, structures, and sounds, contributing to what some scholars and activists consider a Black awakening that continues to influence our social movements today. By exploring the religious and political dimensions of this music, we better understand the social, psychological, and cultural criticisms that arose from the civil rights movement and the counterculture, resulting in changing identities as well as potent resistance to social change. Each week utilizes specific songs as a basis for the lectures and online discussions. Music is studied in the cultural and political contexts in which they were written, sung, recorded, marketed, and sold. This enables us to understand the 1960s as a long historical period, including cultural aspects of World War II, the civil rights movement, the United Farmworkers Huelga, the Vietnam War, and into the Nixon years. Many of the issues that defined the 1960s are being re-litigated, debated, and interpreted in the present.

Kahlo lived at a time when Soviet politics and French surrealism merged with national agendas that sought to redefine Mexico's identity through the integration of their indigenous heritage. The result was a time of booming creativity in the arts, radical expansion of educational and political agendas, as well as a redefinition of women's identity, sexuality, and the Mexican family. We trace Kahlo's romantic and artistic relationship with Diego Rivera as we learn about the Mexican muralism and graphic arts traditions along with the beauty of Mexican music and popular culture. We also become familiar with the works of some of Kahlo's female artist friends, such as Lola \u00c1lvarez Bravo, Tina Moditti, Aurora Reyes, and Mar\u00eda Izquierdo, who gave voice to the voiceless: women, indigenous communities, and the disabled. Finally, we explore topics of Kahlo's representations in media, the commodification of her persona, and how and why she has become a global icon.",

Then we roll up our sleeves and build a capstone project, architecting a digital solution for a realistic business scenario. The course brings together topics learned throughout the students' graduate coursework and creates a collaborative learning experience via lectures, readings, case studies, independent research, and intensive teamwork. The course addresses topics that cross the domains of software engineering and management information systems. It focuses on information technology practices in business enterprises, blending managerial and technical perspectives in each topic. A special emphasis is placed on current digital technologies and their transformative impact on the enterprise-scale, complex software systems. Topics covered include enterprise architecture, software application, business process, digital platforms and technologies, service management, and technology implementation framework. We approach from three perspectives: business (how to achieve goals with digital technology, define requirements, and gauge results), technical (how to architect an enterprise business application, integrate it with other systems, and migrate from an old setup to a new one), and operational (how to deploy a digital technology solution, manage user experience, and operate a technology service).",

Specific managerial topics that students have written on in the past include achieving life/work balance; dealing with inflexible managers; recognizing and overcoming racial, gender, and cultural biases; thinking like an entrepreneur; using effective communication strategies to resolve conflict; creating an inclusive and innovative workplace; overcoming resistance to change; thinking strategically to plan present and future initiatives; developing personal power; and carrying out fragile negotiations. Students are encouraged to share their personal management experiences as they relate to the readings. Films covered include <i>The Aviator</i> (Martin Scorsese), <i>Gandhi</i> (Richard Attenborough), <i>Shall We Dance?</i> (Masayuki Suo), <i>The Age of Innocence</i> (Martin Scorsese), <i>Whale Rider</i> (Niki Caro), and <i>Chariots of Fire</i> (Hugh Hudson), and works of literature include <i>Antigone</i> (Sophocles), <i>Julius Caesar</i> (William Shakespeare), <i>Billy Budd</i> (Herman Melville), <i>The Guest</i> (Albert Camus), <i>A Doll's House</i> (Henrik Ibsen), <i>Things Fall Apart</i> (Chinua Achebe), and <i>The Age of Innocence</i> (Edith Wharton).",

This course examines the literature and the strategies advocates have used to persuade corporations to go beyond diversity and inclusion programs and how our nation's private sector can help work towards a more fair and just society for all its citizenry. The course uses a framework that provides students with a new pathway for this nation's chief executive officers (CEOs) to lead more equitable businesses. This pathway offers a strategy to achieve a fairer country for all by having companies reimagine their actions within their four walls, in the communities where they are situated, and at the societal level. The students explore the historical context for the current inequities within the US and strategies practitioners use to persuade CEOs to adopt a racial equity framework as part of their business model.

This course is for students who wish to harness the power of financial markets to create a better world. As the gatekeepers to finance, lenders and investors are responsible for allocating scarce capital to the most promising sectors. Traditionally, master of business administration programs have taught that these promising sectors were those most likely to maximize shareholder value. Other stakeholders, including the government and society, were considered for their nuisance value more than for their intrinsic worth. In the past two decades, however, the notion of blended value investing, that is, investing for both financial and social gain, has gained credence, even among the most cynical of managers. Moreover, it is widely recognized that lenders and investors, as the ultimate financial decision makers, have special responsibilities in this regard. Investing in women through micro-finance, gender lens investing, or other instruments also play a special role in this arena. Blended value, which encompasses the social, environmental, and financial performance of a business, only becomes more important in a globalized economy marked by scarce and shrinking resources. In this course, we learn to apply the tools of efficient capital markets including risk/return analysis and cost/benefit analysis to produce both financial and social value. We study various instruments that have been designed to achieve these goals and absorb the lessons learned from success and failure of these early instruments. We consider how best to measure social value and how to balance this against the needs of financial investors in order to optimize financial markets to fund the achievement of the United Nation's sustainable development goals (SDGs).",

Then it highlights the specificities of marketing in the luxury sector. Luxury brands are an entirely different proposition and require a very specific approach to brand management and marketing. They notably have to manage a number of inherent paradoxes and tensions. We discuss differences in mass versus luxury marketing approaches. The course also focuses on examining the main challenges with which luxury brands are currently confronted.",

Angry citizens complain about a wide range issues including inequality, privacy, democracy, immigration, trade, job security, health care, and climate change. Are governments really failing to deliver what societies need and citizens want? Perhaps the answer lies in the way success is measured. Amid globalization and the rise of the digital economy, traditional economic measures like gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment, and stock market performance may be leaving governments and citizens with a distorted worldview\u2014and a shaky foundation for policy decisions. This course investigates limitations with conventional yardsticks used for assessing national output, employment, inflation, productivity, and trade, and asks what components of a successful society we fail to measure at all. Public policies that are based on inaccurate or incomplete data are likely to have unintended consequences leading to financial meltdowns, environmental degradation, economic inequality, and pandemics. Moreover, failing to fully account for true costs can skew individual, corporate, and governmental behavior towards short-term versus sustainability. As a response, many scholars\u2014from economists to sociologists\u2014are formulating new metrics and new philosophies to address such concerns and to utilize the unprecedented amount of data now available for analysis. This course hopes to inspire social entrepreneurs to develop innovative, superior, and sustainable approaches to economics and finance that make the world better for all.",

First, to provide students with basic geographical, historical, and contextual frameworks for the study of Australian First Nations visual art, culture, and politics in mainland Australia and the islands of Tasmania, Tiwi, and the Torres Strait.

Though the question is notoriously hard to make precise, one way or another it has animated much literature and art, and also much philosophy. Some philosophers have provided very disheartening answers to the questions of whether life has meaning, including that life is suffering and then it ends; life is absurd and never gains any meaning; life is all about creating hell for each other and we cannot escape. But other philosophers have provided more uplifting answers. Both kinds of answers deserve serious scrutiny. Such scrutiny should be of interest to anybody who wishes to make reflection on their life as a whole part of their education. After reviewing a number of pessimistic and more optimistic approaches to the meaning of life we also turn to the subject of death. We all die eventually. We normally encounter death among family and friends before we have to deal with our own. These themes too are the subject of philosophical reflection. The course finishes with a discussion of an important set of lectures on the topics of this course by a contemporary philosopher. This course is quite wide-ranging and integrates historical figures and references to art and literature as appropriate, but its main focus is on contributions by relatively recent thinkers in the Anglo-American analytical tradition of philosophy. The methodology of this course is philosophical. Some of the topics may touch you quite personally and you should take this into account before enrolling.",

        "course_description": "Resources espousing mindfulness as a lifestyle, practice, or means of self-growth have exploded in the last few decades. Celebrities and scientists alike have taken to academic platforms and social media to champion the significance of a present state of mind. But what, if anything, do figures such as Lebron James and some of the earliest practitioners of contemplative practices like Aristotle have in common? This course studies mindfulness in its historical and contemporary context, examining the long and ancient history of looking inward and examining the self. We consider the emergence of mindfulness as a term and practice in the last century, whilst also considering the ways in which it is connected to\u2014and distinct from\u2014traditions past. We study some of the earliest discussions on reflective and meditative practices, beginning with the ancient Greek philosophers, moving on to Sufi and dervish literature, and ending with a study of the teachings of the popular, contemporary Vietnamese Thi\u00ean Buddhist monk, Th\u00edch Nh\u00e2t H?nh. We consider how the notion of contemplation and mindfulness is presented and negotiated in the writings of each of these authors, and whether there are parallels to be found across histories and cultures. Then, we switch gears and adopt a more contemporary lens, studying mindfulness from the perspective of modern science. Several recent studies in psychology and medicine have attempted to place mindfulness and meditation in conversation with cognition and neuroscience. Our task is to better understand how mindfulness is measured, defined, and studied in these relatively new fields. Finally, we study the role of body and movement in contemplative practice. We ask why the body is so critical in ancient yogic wisdom on the mind, what modern notions of a flow state mean, and consider why athletes such as Bruce Lee and Lebron James understand their physical craft as intimately connected to a mindful mental state. As we study mindfulness beyond the mind, we supplement our studies of texts with analysis of non-literary and contemporary resources, such as the modern podcast, and artistic endeavors. Throughout the course we consider how our history and our present merge in the study of mindfulness and what it can disclose of our understanding of human experience.",

Even in the twenty-first century, philosophers writing in classical Sanskrit (as well as modern South Asian languages) continue to debate these issues. In this course, we focus on some core areas of Indian philosophy and engage in the arguments that were of interest to philosophers who wrote in classical Sanskrit.

Nonetheless, sleep remains mysterious and controversial and, remarkably, there still is no generally agreed upon function for this behavioral state that occupies one third of our lives. Importantly, sleep science exemplifies the translational approach in biomedical science whereby human and animal research together continually advance the field of sleep medicine. Following an overview on the physiology and behavioral neuroscience of sleep, students choose a topic related to the effects of sleep on mental health to research in depth, to present to the class, and to discuss in a term paper. Topics might include the characteristic abnormalities in sleep occurring in mood, anxiety, psychotic, addictive, autism spectrum, or neurodegenerative disorders. Such changes are increasingly seen as bidirectional, with sleep disturbances contributing to the waking symptoms of these mental disorders. Other topics might focus on the contribution of primary sleep disorders to psychiatric and neurological illness such as the linkage between sleep apnea and depression, circadian rhythm disorders in bipolar illness, insomnia as a risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders, or contribution of nocturnal seizures to neurodevelopmental disorders. Still other topics may focus on the contribution of normal sleep to emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and human performance factors. For those with more neuroscientific interests, topics might include neuroimaging of cognitive functioning following sleep deprivation or the growing interest in trafficking and disposal of abnormal proteins during sleep having a potential role in neurodegenerative illness.",

How is diversity related to people's perceptions of fairness and justice? What is the relevance of people's perceptions of fairness and justice to social problems and social change? Does respect for diversity promote peace and positive change? Much research has addressed these questions, and we closely examine the evidence that has emerged so far.",

Examples include spaceflight; high altitude flights or mountaineering; submersed or underwater activities; and polar, desert, or jungle exploration. In addition to these classical extreme environments, the COVID-19 pandemic placed a large portion of the world's population in an extreme environment defined by social and physical isolation/confinement, movement and travel restrictions, disruption of personal and professional activities, and novel health risks and behavioral adjustments. This course covers the effects of extreme environmental exposures on major physiologic systems and the resulting neurophysiologic and neurobehavioral performance and (re)adaptation. These topics are augmented by contemporary findings from research studies conducted in operational environments and discussed in the context of history, experimental methods, and research paradigms used in extreme environmental physiology and translational neuroscience. We also review current studies emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss them in the context of transition from every day to a new normal extreme environment, including physiologic, behavioral, and social adaptations. Theoretical concepts and research findings are evaluated relative to their utility in developing functional countermeasures for extreme human habitation as well as methods for clinical treatment of related medical conditions in the general population. As such, this course may be particularly interesting to students pursuing careers in translational neuroscience, psychology, extreme physiology/medicine, and human performance in extreme environments.

How do these things happen? This course explores the psychological mechanisms that enable cults to form and to take things to such extremes. What do cults share with other groups (mainstream religions, nations, and everyday social interactions), and what makes them stand apart? In what ways are cults an environment in which many of our psychological tendencies (toward ingroup conformity, heuristic decision making, and rationalization) are magnified?

In addition to examining the conflicts themselves, we also explore the religious dimensions of the impacts those conflicts have on civic life in areas such as public health, education, and commerce. What roles do religions play in fostering violence and what roles do they play in promoting peace? How do religious institutions and ideologies function to support and/or thwart public health initiatives? What are the ideological justifications for functional economic policies and how do they reflect and/or challenge diverse religious values? What roles do religions play in advancing or suppressing educational opportunities and for whom? Are media representations of the religious dimensions of conflict accurate?

Why is dying so difficult and how can we make death a better experience for others, and ultimately ourselves? This course examines notions of identity, hope, and what counts as a good outcome through a close reading of Paul Kalanithi's dying memoir <i>When Breath Becomes Air</i> and Atul Gawande's <i>Being Mortal</i>. It then turns to how we make sense of suffering, anticipate and practice grief, and care for the memories of the dead through a reading of Michelle Zauner's <i>Crying in H-Mart</i> and Emily Rapp's <i>The Still Point of the Turning World</i>. Finally, we consider philosophical reflections on mortality, including if death is bad, how death should change the way we live, and why we ought to strive to live and die with gratitude.",

        "course_description": "This course examines the complex ways in which Hollywood has responded to, and reflected on, the social, cultural, and political need for superheroes. The concept of the superhero functions as a structuring idea in American self-understanding and cultural iconography. Originally the stuff of comic books, the superhero has now become associated with the Hollywood blockbuster, a genre in its own right. And yet, much-deserved scholarly and academic interest has only recently caught up with this popular phenomenon in American cinema and television. How might we make sense of blockbuster superheroes? Are they agents of change, or upholders of the status quo? Are they virtuous or flawed? Are they patriots of the nation, or rather vigilantes distrusting government authority? Are they promoters of the common good, or rather prime exemplars of American individualism? Do they save us from our enemies, or from ourselves? Are they motivated by utopian dreams of a better world, or by collective fears and anxieties? Is the supervillain a foreign entity, an Other antithetical to US values, or a repressed, undesired trait in the American self? And to what extent are race, gender, religion, and ethnicity factors in the development of superhero cinema? What is the relationship between superheroes and real-life heroes? And, above all, what is the place of heroes in American history? At a time when superhero cinema has established itself as a staple of Hollywood blockbuster productions, reaching ever-broader audiences and becoming part of the popular cultural lexicon, the mission of this course is threefold. First, we examine the iconography of the superhero as a timeless mainstay of American mythology. Second, we investigate specific ways in which superhero cinema has mirrored, and intervened in, American political, social, and cultural history, especially when certain ideals, dreams and liberties have become tenuous\u2014whether it is fascism, the Holocaust, the cold war, totalitarian governments, 9/11 terrorism, warrantless wiretapping, conspiracy, international espionage, police brutality, suspicious data collection, or fake news. Third, we probe to what extent the Hollywood superhero\u2014a barometer of domestic social history and a fundamental part of Americana\u2014is actually a product of foreign influence, in surprising, and sometimes even problematic, ways. We examine films and television shows ranging from <i>Superman: The Movie</i> (1978), <i>X-Men</i> (2000), <i>Unbreakable</i> (2000), <i>Spider-Man</i> (2002), <i>V For Vendetta</i> (2005), <i>Iron Man</i> (2008), <i>The Dark Knight</i> (2008), <i>Watchmen</i> (2009) <i>Captain America</i> (2011), <i>X-Men: First Class</i> (2011), <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i> (2014), <i>Wonder Woman</i> (2017), <i>Black Panther</i> (2018), <i>The Umbrella Academy</i> (2020), <i>The Boys</i> (2910), and <i>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</i> (2021).",

The course is framed around three central questions: how is landscape architecture currently practiced in African countries? What lessons can we learn from landscape practices in various African societies that can help mitigate the impacts of climate change and social inequities? And as landscape architecture unfolds across the continent in the next 50-200 years, how can it continue assert its agency in the fight against changing climates and social inequity and claim a central space in the shaping of African cities of the future? In collaboration with several practitioners and academics from across the continent, this course explores what it means to practice and teach landscape architecture in societies in which the profession is nascent or non-existent and speculate on the future of the shaping of landscapes in the global south.",

By examining the creative interventions of storytellers, performers, and artists in response to a wide range of ruptures and transformations from political upheaval to genocidal violence, forced migration, social revolution, ecological disaster, and everyday rites of passage, the course illuminates and interrogates the powers, potentials, politics, and poetics of cultural performance, communal storytelling, ritual praxis, and folkloric tradition in the face of destabilizing change and unprecedented emergencies. We ask how storytellers revive and revise old stories to confront new challenges; how preexisting expressive forms weather unprecedented socio-cultural storms; and how individuals and communities attempt to re-narrate themselves after calamity. What role can storytelling play in imagining communities, navigating rites of passage, and confronting existential and ethical dilemmas? How do people turn their afflictions into art? What roles can folklore play in reimagining communities, rehabilitating selves, and remaking worlds? Beginning with a critical re-examination of popular discourses of crisis and emergency, we explore the potentials and limitations of these categories as they relate to everyday life and inter-subjective exchange in places as diverse as the refugee camps of Rwanda, the bayous of Louisiana, the pubs of Ireland, the alleyways of Cairo, and the message boards of 4-Chan. Along with troubling the lines between the everyday and the emergency, in the manner of Walter Benjamin, we also investigate Martin Heidegger's distinction between artistic performances that rescue us from the emergency and those that rescue us into the emergency. Through critical engagement with a diverse array of texts, artistic creations, cultural practices, and folkloric performances, this course calls attention to the ways in which scholarly production, humanitarian intervention, political activism, and artistic performance are implicated and imbricated in the production of crisis, for better and for worse. In treating crisis as both experiential reality for those who live through it, and as what Janet Roitman calls a &quot;narrative construction,&quot; the course ultimately seeks to interrogate its own premise, illuminating the ways in which the invocation of emergency itself might be considered a form of artistic, imaginative, and transformative interventions.",

Our approach in the course emphasizes the role of language in understanding all aspects of human social relations. We consider these basic questions: what is language? How are we to understand linguistic diversity and language change? Does speaking a particular language affect our understanding of the world? How does language variation mark and reproduce hierarchical social divisions such as class, race, ethnic, and gender differences? What are the social effects of language standardization and whose interest does it serve? How are power differences between speakers manifest in their use of language? How are social identities and relations enacted in face-to-face conversations? In answering these questions we view language both as a formal symbolic system and as an open, flexible, and strategic cultural resource.

We consider questions such as, how do the different kinds of exchanges we engage in\u2014gift exchanges versus market exchanges, for instance\u2014shape our relationships with others? We explore the social meaning of money and the role of the market in our lives. In a world where it is possible to rent a family, does money destroy love and intimacy? What aspects of our lives are governed by the logic of capitalism and what aspects escape capitalism's grip? Why does it feel shameful to be in debt, and how has this shame been manipulated for political purposes? Why in the US do we consider work to be sacred and morally purifying even though many of us have tedious jobs?

These outbreaks emphasize the importance of understanding the epidemiology of infectious diseases through qualitative and quantitative methods. This course introduces the basics of infectious disease epidemiology and modeling, disease surveillance methods, dynamics of transmission, and assessment of prevention and control measures. The epidemiology of different diseases based on route of transmission (food-borne, water-borne, vector-borne, or air-borne) along with common and recently emerged infectious diseases (COVID-19, influenza, malaria, Ebola, Zika, and antimicrobial resistance pathogens) are discussed. Finally, we explore some modeling techniques to understand the epidemiology and dynamics of infectious disease outbreaks to help public health officials make more informed decisions. We consider the political, demographic, and social changes that have an impact on public health.",

In this underworld, the protagonist must face mortality and gain knowledge to bring back to the world of the living. In this course, we explore underworlds in prose, poetry, and film, possibly including but not limited to Karen Russell's <i>Swamplandia!</i>, Grace Dane Mazur's <i>Garden Party</i>, Katherine May's <i>Wintering</i>, Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>, Hayao Miyazaki's <i>Spirited Away</i>, and Disney's <i>Coco</i>. Drawing upon the great literary pool of underworld traditions, students write their own stories about descents (both literal and metaphorical), creatively depicting the other world, the risks faced, and the knowledge gained. Students produce a complete short story, a chapter of a new work, or a new chapter for a work in progress.",

Techniques include the most important thing to know about how Shakespeare builds his characters (developed by John Barton), using key-words and key-rhythms in a character's language, why writers should obscure a character's motives, Frank Kermode's concept of Shakespeare as a virtuoso of openings, making minor characters spicy, and the creative use of stereotypes. Course work for individual students culminates in a major writing project in the student's chosen genre (for example, a play, screenplay, piece of short fiction, or piece of long fiction). There are weekly writing exercises on the character techniques discussed in class; these exercises are the same for everyone, regardless of the genre of their writing project. The writing project and the weekly exercises comprise the portfolio to be turned in at the end of the course.

Students gain an overview of the possibilities and challenges of building complex information systems that take advantage of recent advances in these fields. Although the course covers three distinct areas, the emphasis is to have each student develop a personal toolkit of analytic approaches that can be used to analyze and understand problems in these or any other area at the leading edge of applied computer science. Students gain an understanding of what is possible today, what is likely to be delivered from research labs and into production within the next three years, and what is almost certainly science fiction. The course begins with a full-stack introduction to the computer science ecosystem, starting with the fundamentals of digital computers and computation, modern system architectures, the technology supply ecosystem, funding mechanisms, customers, and the impact of governments and mega-corporations. Students learn how to find and understand the research literature of computer science. Next, this course explores how cybersecurity is a constant issue that must be addressed at every level of the stack; to do this, the course uses a combination of first principles and a case-study approach. The second part surveys state-of-the-art topics in designing AI products and services. The focus of this part of the course is to understand AI's rapidly evolving frontier. It covers the history and likely future directions of research, including the 50-year tension between symbolic and connectionist (neural network) approaches to AI, the AI hype cycle, knowledge representation, computer vision, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. Topics in this first section also include existing hurdles for successful AI design such as explainability, visualization, and adversarial attacks. The third part of the course looks at the IoT. While the promise of the IoT brings many new business opportunities, it also presents significant challenges including architectural choices, security concerns, moral challenges, and the potential for social upheaval. This part of the course offers approaches for identifying important choices facing designers\u2014for example, the engineering and business tradeoffs between using AI at the edge or in the cloud. By the end of the course students come to appreciate that cyber, AI, and IoT all seem like different things, and indeed are all being researched and practiced by different groups, but that success in both the marketplace and in the competition between the great powers requires mastery of all three, because they are really all aspects of using machine computation for human advantage.",

An SPA is a special classification of a website or web application in which the user can navigate between different screens without loading a new web page. Instead, new content may be accessed directly from the server using an application programming interface (API). This results in performance improvements and a more dynamic experience. Well-constructed SPAs include a rich user interface to provide a seamless interactive user experience. Two well-known examples of SPAs are Gmail and Twitter, which both provide dynamic page views without the need to reload the page. SPAs can be created with Javascript as well as various frameworks including React, Angular, Node.js, and Vue.js. We explore the pros and cons of SPAs, as well as their effective design. We explore several technologies in the course including JavaScript ECMAScript 6, React, JSON, and APIs, as well as mechanisms involved in SPA development such as components, routing, and state management. This hands-on course includes many coding assignments to help students master the techniques used to build an SPA, culminating in a final project to build a comprehensive single-page web application.",

Students work in a collaborative atmosphere with classmates and the instructor to refine scripts and treatments, plan productions, and create the final film. Students may work individually or partner in a collaborative team. Either way, the course serves as a support system for each student, offering advice, critiques, and resources so that each member is an integral part of a fully realized short. In addition to supporting traditional filmmaking approaches, innovative storytelling techniques are strongly welcomed and supported. These can include interactive online documentaries, hybrid approaches (blending fiction and nonfiction), webisode pilots, and experimental techniques. Additionally, the course demystifies the online distribution process and the film festival circuit, exploring the many avenues filmmakers can take to get their work shown to a wider audience.",

When the Fed or the European Central Bank announces a monthly $85 billion securities buying program, how exactly does this money flow through the markets? When the government bails out a major bank, how does this action affect the bank, its competitors, the markets, future perceptions, and the economy at large? How can central banks affect the economy in an environment of zero and even negative interest rates? Should regulation influence the behavior of firms or individuals? Using the 2008 financial crisis and policy responses thereto as a backdrop, we explore how (and whether) the new capital markets created over the past thirty years as a result of greatly increased financial innovation, globalization, and communication are distorting the economic effect of traditional government monetary and/or fiscal influence. The role of important constituents (commercial and investment banks, exchanges, regulators, hedge funds, and government interventions) are reviewed and evaluated for both past performance and future relevance. The course addresses important current topics in both economics and public policy, such as too big to fail, moral hazard, globalization of markets, currency unions, liquidity traps, efficiency of markets, the role of credit rating agencies, shadow banking, regulation of derivatives and hedge funds, Glass-Steagall, and the Volcker Rule. Following deliberations and analysis of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, we then examine the monetary and fiscal policy responses to the pandemic crisis of 2020-2022. Were these policy responses even more extreme? Did central banks overshoot? Were lessons learned from the financial crisis? Was it too much, leading to inflation and too much debt?",

They were dead wrong. The historical evidence enables us to gain a more thorough understanding of global finance which influences our lives to such a great extent. Our primary aim is not to concentrate on facts, theorems, or numbers but rather to see the big picture in a multi-disciplinary and very-long-run perspective integrating the knowledge gained from the work of such Nobel Prize-winning behavioral economists as Robert Shiller and Daniel Kahneman. We also explore our current economic situation, including the aftermath of the Wall Street bailouts that forgot the people on Main Street and stood by as nine million people were evicted from their homes.

Encountering such poets as Herman Melville, Julia Ward Howe, Walt Whitman, Edward Arlington Robinson, Paul Laurence Dunbar, James Weldon Johnson, Francis Ellen Watkins Harper, Emma Lazarus, and W.E.B.

As we enter the twentieth century, we encounter modernism, a movement that spanned the decades from the 1910s to the mid-1940s, and whose poetry marked a clear break from past traditions and past forms. We read such poets as Robert Frost, T.S. Eliot, Marianne Moore, Langston Hughes, William Carlos Williams, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Claude McKay, Dorothy Parker, and Wallace Stevens. We study how these poets employed the language of rejection and revolution, of making and remaking, of artistic appropriation and cultural emancipation. Traveling to the homes and workplaces of Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens; to the Poetry Foundation in Chicago, where the institution of American modernism was born; and even exploring the River Thames in the London of Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i>, we see the sites that witnessed and cultivated the rise of American modernism.",

The scientist in literature is often represented as mad because of his willingness to go to any length to advance the cause of science\u2014and never more so than when experiments have unintended consequences or escape the scientist's control. This fear of science and the scientist becomes a serious literary preoccupation during the nineteenth century, when experiments in electricity, reanimation, chemistry, surgery, vivisection, the use of new technologies, and the implications of Darwinism were being widely discussed and their morality questioned. With the birth of the nuclear age in the twentieth century, public anxiety about science and its uses only intensified\u2014and continues to this day. This course examines five works that dramatize the dilemma of the scientist when confronting the monstrosities he creates or those over which science appears to be powerless: Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i> (1818), Robert Louis Stevenson's <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> (1886), H.G. Wells' <i>The Island of Dr. Moreau</i> (1896), Bram Stoker's <i>Dracula</i> (1897), and C.P. Snow's <i>The New Men</i> (1954). We investigate the medical and scientific backgrounds of these works, the controversies they precipitated, and the authors' unusual storytelling devices.

What does it even mean to transcend? Transcend what and to where? In this course, we attempt to figure out what transcendentalism is and why it matters by traversing its theological, historical, and literary contexts. Tracing (or perhaps dissolving) the boundary between human, world, and god, we investigate how intellectual and social revolution happens without distinguishing poetry from science, religion from politics, accident from fate, and perhaps even transcendence from immanence. We ask, among other questions, what are our obligations to ourselves and our neighbors or to animals and plants? Are we bound to respect what violates our conscience?

What do works published by Isaiah Thomas (an eighteenth-century publisher who popularized children's literature in New England) have in common with stories by Margaret Wise Brown, Ezra Jack Keats, and Christian Robinson? How do the first books we encounter shape us and what can they help us understand about the culture at large? We explore these and other questions throughout our time together, as we map the relationship between today's market for children's books and the rich and contested history of the form.",

Eudora Welty and Alice Munro continued innovative portrayal of the humane irony and the moral acuteness present in Chekhov's and Joyce's vision of life, and added new comedy and intimacy to plot structure, character portrayal, and unified effect, the technical matters that comprise the artistic pleasure found in the modernist short story's style. All four writers in the course focus their tales on ordinary circumstances which give rise to poignant, startling revelations of how we make, and are made, what we are in the world. The course's aim is to understand how these revelations arise when a writer masters what Chekhov called &quot;the compactness that makes things alive.&quot;",

This course investigates best practices and approaches to measuring and mitigating indirect GHG emissions, also known as Scope 3 emissions. These emissions include all indirect GHG emissions that occur in a value chain and therefore outside the direct control of a typical organization. Supply chain emissions are frequently the largest overall source of an organization's GHG emissions and are becoming an increasingly relevant topic as more companies outsource manufacturing, logistics, and other key functions to third parties. Waste, water use, and GHG emissions are still incurred in bringing products and services to consumers, but they are often not fully accounted for. Proper accounting for these emissions that are known contributors to climate change is coming under increasing scrutiny through major disclosure initiatives including the passage of California Senate Bill 253, The Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the European Commission's European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), which require businesses to publicly report their GHG emissions. Similar initiatives have also been proposed by the US Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) and other regions around the world. Students in this course learn the foundational skills necessary for organizations to comply with these GHG emission disclosures, including how to gather data from disparate sources, how to calculate or estimate emissions, and how the procurement of supplies, services, and travel can be managed to mitigate or even reduce indirect emissions. The course also familiarizes students with leading measurement and goal setting standards (the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the Climate Registry, Science Based Targets, and the Carbon Disclosure Project or CDP) and investigates indirect emissions reduction efforts that are underway at several leading Fortune 500 companies as well as universities, municipalities, and government agencies.",

We investigate market distortions, health risks, government subsidies making processed food cheaper than healthy food, fair trade, ethics and equitable distribution of food, alternative farming techniques (integrated pest management and permaculture), corporations and big agriculture (Monsanto and Cargill), climate change and carnivores, factory farming and animal feed, habitat destruction and land use conversion including prioritization based on ecosystem services to humanity, agrochemical and pesticide biomagnification, high density farming techniques (vertical farming), fast food, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Emphasis is placed on US and global food subsidies, including origins and underpinnings. Participants solve a problem within the industrialized food system by critically analyzing how the pursuit of profit, excessive consumption, and unethical practices within the global food system impact both individual well-being and the long-term viability of our planet. By examining case studies, research findings, and policy frameworks, students gain a deep understanding of the multifaceted issues surrounding food and greed, and develop the knowledge and skills necessary to address these challenges.",

This course takes lessons from the theories and practices of sustainable investment in the professional investment industry, and makes them accessible to other disciplines and fields. Every investment has implicit environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, because every decision made relies upon humans to make, do, buy, or sell something, and relies upon the rule of law to govern contractual relationships between businesses and protect minority investors. In every sector and situation, one is increasingly expected to identify, measure, and report material ESG risks, returns, and impact. Investment decisions are made daily for more than US $100 trillion in assets under management professionally in the global investment industry, and it is projected to grow to US $145.4 trillion by 2025. This course explores capital allocation decisions more broadly, translating the practices from the investment context to other situations of capital allocation. In a world with interconnected decision-making processes and consequences, more stakeholders demand greater transparency, customers have expectations of their vendors, reputation and litigation risks are profligate, and regulators seek to reduce negative impacts on society. Sustainable investment proactively considers themes and issues such as climate pollution, workplace safety, employee health and wellness, local community relationships, diversity, executive compensation, business ethics, corruption, and new markets for zero pollution innovation. Climate is the meta-theme overarching all investment strategies. This course is grounded in industry experience and cross-disciplinary academic and practitioner literature. The course employs the Socratic method. We blend practitioner literature with current academic research to ensure students learn from the most relevant material, including Harvard Business School case studies and case examples drawn from the food and beverage sector. We explore critiques of sustainable investment to better understand the gaps in theory and practice. We provide access to experts from across the spectrum so students may learn from multiple perspectives, and engage with different roles.

What are the limits of our understandings and when do we need to bring in others to develop site-specific analysis and strategies? Professionals in the sustainability and global development fields often need to work on or assess agriculture, water, and natural resource conservation projects and supply chains across different geographic, ecological, and agricultural regions. While they do not have to be experts in every situation, they do need to be able to learn quickly about complex natural systems in order to work effectively in teams, provide analysis, and make programmatic decisions. Despite the diversity of these natural systems, there are common processes and mechanisms that underpin and connect all of them. There are key questions one can ask in any situation to learn more. If professionals are familiar with these common ecological and physical processes, then they are capable of quickly adjusting their work to new contexts by asking relevant technical questions, recognizing what they do not yet know, and identifying with whom they should consult. This course is designed to cultivate critical thinking as it relates to natural resources management to help each student understand common processes across natural systems and to develop a set of questions that can guide their future work in any given location. The course covers the core characteristics and management of water, soils, forests, pastures, and agricultural systems and how they are interconnected. Specific topics include water resources, river dynamics, and how natural and human-caused ecosystem disturbance such as fire, logging, and grazing factor into the ecology and succession of forests, grasslands, agriculture, and ecological restoration.

In the first, students learn about the environmental, health, and ethical costs of animal agriculture (with a global focus though the United States is highlighted). Topics include: animal agriculture's impact on climate change, as well as other less well known planetary boundaries like biodiversity loss, nitrogen/phosphorus cycles, water use, and land use; animal agriculture's impact on health, including both communicable and non-communicable diseases; animal agriculture's ethical costs, with a focus on marginalized black and brown populations who disproportionately bear these costs. In the second unit, we turn our attention to the lack of attention on these costs in policy, with a focus on the United States. Here, the topics include: subsidies (highlighting the lack of public investment in alternative proteins, in contrast to the approach taken by other countries like Singapore, Israel, and China); regulation (explaining how factory farms are virtually unregulated due to exemptions and lack of willingness in the US); legislation or proposed legislation (including the Green New Deal, the Biden Plan, and the Paris Agreement). In the third unit, we showcase the vast array of actors who are part of the food systems shift. The course aims to show students that they have opportunities to be part of the change by connecting them with other actors in the space including policymakers and staff, industry leaders in the plant-based sector, health professionals, academics, and advocates and activists.",

Yet, for such a critical infrastructure, the mini-grid sector is far from standardized and faces several challenges. This course takes a deep dive into the rapidly evolving technologies, business models, policies, and project development approaches that are driving innovation in rural electricity access in emerging economies. Students learn the context of energy poverty, how limited energy access underlies numerous development challenges, and the various current approaches for rural electrification. The course then focuses specifically on renewable energy mini-grids, introducing the technology stack\u2014generation, power conversion, energy storage, distribution, and metering\u2014and their different architectures and business models for service delivery. Students learn specific tools and methods for the mini-grid project development process, including feasibility studies, demand estimation, risk assessment, and project financing. Students learn participatory planning and community engagement techniques that align project design with community expectations and increase community agency. The course draws on case studies and contributions from active practitioners, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.

The course begins with an overview of theory and research on community empowerment and a review of successful sustainability initiatives. Then, utilizing an experiential act-to-learn model (rather than a traditional learn-to-act approach), students are assigned to teams and paired with external sustainability practitioners (for example, change leaders working on social justice, climate, education, infrastructure, or health initiatives). Students learn community engagement skills and praxis (creating space for reflection and collective action) with practitioners' target community beneficiaries. After engaging with beneficiaries, students provide partners with a clearer picture of the community's needs and collaborate to co-create an updated community-centric theory of change and a draft a proposed community-led project charter. Throughout the course, students learn practical skills and tools associated with community empowerment and local leadership development. Students also learn and practice reflective coaching and engage in weekly coaching sessions.",

        "course_name": "Designing Sustainability Research",
        "course_description": "Research projects in sustainability are complex and transcend the boundaries of conventional disciplines such as economics, international relations, and sociology. Sustainability and carbon issues affect and interact with monetary stability, industrial policy, and more; comprise different analytical foci, including human behavior, politics, and power conflicts; and operate across multiple units of analysis such as individuals, groups, organizations, states, and relationships between states. Research designs must integrate distinct components coherently and logically to adequately capture this multidimensionality. A good research project has both good ideas and good design. While good ideas can be hard to pin down, a longstanding set of rules and design principles can help us turn compelling ideas into excellent research. Good design makes ideas more accessible, persuasive, and likely to achieve their aims. This course provides students with the fundamental principles for designing research projects in the sustainability field, including how to link empirical data to concepts, concepts to theory, and theory to research strategy. This includes articulating a problem, question, or research puzzle and providing a rationale for it; reviewing the relevant literature; advancing a hypothesis or argument; constructing a theoretical framework; defining concepts, variables, and relationships; and designing a test of the hypothesis or argument. Once students learn the principles of research design, their reading and comprehension of even the densest academic writing will improve. When one knows what to expect from the research design of an article, report, or book one is better able to distinguish the argument from the evidence, the logic from the information, and the normative issues (that is, what should be done) from underlying and wider practical and theoretical implications. We explore current issues in sustainability research through a number of cases that bring the full array of research design, including cross-sectional, longitudinal, and comparative designs. The particular order in which these designs are introduced throughout the course follows a cumulative rationale (that is, starting with most descriptive designs to most deductive designs). While the methodological focus is on qualitative approaches, we also look at nested designs, deploying qualitative and quantitative analytical tools simultaneously. This involves hands-on practice. By drafting a research design for a sustainability project, justifying their strategy, and examining their work for potential flaws, students' research critical thinking improves. At the same time, students gain further insights through peer and diagnostic review processes and illustrations of common research designs in sustainability studies.",

        "course_description": "Planet earth has never been this hot and polluted in all of human history. In 2024, the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, ocean temperatures, and average air temperatures have all reached epoch high levels, while sea ice and glaciers continue disappearing. By 2050, the European Commission estimates the region will need 450 million tons of carbon dioxide removal a year. BloombergNEF reports that global carbon capture and storage capacity was only 50 million tons in 2022. The crucial element of any net-zero scenario is some method to offset climate pollution already in the atmosphere by deploying technologies that remove greenhouse gasses from the atmosphere. Every ambition by governments, corporations, and citizens to cut climate pollution and slow the momentum of the Anthropocene relies upon some method to pull pollution from the sky in large amounts. Negative emissions technologies (NET) offer some options to succeed in pulling pollution from the sky or wherever else it can be diverted before it does damage. This course is designed to be inclusive and draw perspectives across borders to explore the technologies, models, and methods being deployed to bend down the long, rising arc tracing centuries of increasing industrial-scale climate pollution. Using the most recent academic research, practitioner research reports from pilot projects and lab work, and portfolio decarbonization paths, this course explores the theories and practices in direct air capture and carbon capture and long term storage. For example, we reference global frameworks such as the revised Oxford Offsetting Principles 2024, investments in advanced market commitments by Shopify's sustainability fund, and the progress by Norway's Blomoyna project. To provide students with the most relevant material, we employ guest lectures from the inventors, engineers, policymakers, and investors who are trying to win the race to zero. We draw upon projects from around the world and available Harvard Business School case studies on, for example, Climeworks, Total Energies, and green steel. Of all the climate problems to solve, none is larger than removing and returning greenhouse gas pollution to the geologic cycle. This course focuses on what successes are possible and how to learn from failures, cut through the greenwashing, and explore what lies ahead.",

Students learn about the steps involved in assessing vulnerabilities and how to take the necessary steps to reduce those vulnerabilities through adaptation planning. Because we cannot adapt infinitely, students learn how to find and implement carbon mitigation opportunities. The implementation and effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation actions necessary to stabilize the climate and create a sustainable environment depend significantly on climate policy. The promulgation of climate policy alone, however, is not sufficient and depends on planning methods capable of fostering actions that meet policy goals. Therefore, students also develop a broad understanding of current domestic and international climate policies and agreements, as well as planning frameworks that help structure actions, hold parties accountable, and create incentives and mechanisms toward climate adaptation. Understanding climate policy is necessary for describing legal standards, regulatory attainment, the terms of treaties and agreements, and how to meet such benchmarks.",

The Black freedom struggle, or the civil rights movement, encompassed a range of economic, social, and political demands that affected every person living in the United States. This course re-examines parts of the movement that are well known, like Martin Luther King, Jr., or non-violent direct action, as well as lesser-known elements of the movement like sharecroppers in Alabama joining the Communist Party or the role of Black Power advocates in shaping modern America. Together we study the art, literature, music, and history of the movement and how it transformed American society. The course focuses on deepening our knowledge of the civil rights movement through in-depth discussions during class. Each day students have a reading to complete. In class, we read primary sources together and I offer short lectures to help contextualize each class's discussion topics. There is always time for questions. Students do not need any previous study of African American history in order to take this course.",

Some of the questions that guide our discussions are: what is grand strategy and what is it for? What are the sources of grand strategy and how are grand strategies formulated? What are the main tools to implement a grand strategy? Should the US engage in an active internationalist strategy or retreat from its international commitments?",

In this rendering, primordial hatreds are driving religious wars and civil conflict with Iran, at the heart of the so-called Shi'a crescent, and Saudi Arabia, the stalwart of true Sunni identity. However, such approaches mask over a more complex understanding of the changes occurring in today's Middle East and prevents accurately differentiating between distinct yet overlapping factors such as actual substantive theological and intellectual differences between Shi'a and Sunni Islam, state competition (that is, between Iran and Saudi Arabia), and historical legacies of empire and state building in the Middle East. This course addresses such dominant narratives and challenges conventional understandings of the interplay between religion and politics in the Middle East and how sectarianism, Shi'a Islam, and geopolitical conflict can be more properly understood from a rigorous analytical perspective and focuses on the foundations and varieties of modern Shi'a political thought; religious clerical institutions; Shi'a political parties and militias in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen; and Iran's Islamic revolution, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and the Basij paramilitary organization.",

In this narrative, the North won and the South lost. But what if the issues that resulted in such devastating bloodshed were never resolved? What if the war never ended? This course demonstrates the ways in which the United States is still fighting the Civil War, a defining event in US history. In each class, we connect current events to readings and themes in the course, highlighting how and why the war is still being fought. From Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831 to the recent riot (or battle) in Charlottesville and the seditious conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election results, we trace how and why the South was in certain respects the victor, even though the Confederacy was destroyed and the Constitution amended. We explore the different kinds of war\u2014ideological, political, cultural, military, and para-military\u2014that placed the unfreedom of blacks\u2014as slaves, serfs, and prisoners\u2014at the center of larger conflicts over federal versus state and local rule, welfare, globalization, and free trade. We analyze the Civil War in literature, art, politics, photography, prints, film, music, poetry, speeches, and history, while also discovering how these cultural forms worked to shape our memory of the event itself.

From there, we proceed chronologically through American history to the present, exploring changing notions of community, strategies used to gain freedom, and the range of violent responses that groups seeking liberation encountered. Our readings include a play by Suzan Lori-Parks, manifestos by white power advocates, George Schuyler's novel <i>Black No More</i>, essays by Toni Morrison, political speeches, and oral history interviews with formerly enslaved people and migrant workers, among many other historical and literary sources. While race has been an important element to every debate about political representation in American history, most debates represented overlapping interests of race, gender, class, and even sexuality.

Namely, how can one begin to tell the story and the legacy of a people whose lives have been so severely distorted and erased by primary historical records\u2014records which were primarily composed by people invested in maintaining and reproducing Black enslavement? And to what extent should one trust those primary documents in telling the story of even the most powerful people and institutions in these societies? The course is organized around key phenomena and themes in the history of slavery and early Black Atlantic history, including: the transatlantic slave trade; Black self-determination and revolt; slavery and the formations of race, gender, and sexuality in the West; slavery, capitalism, and liberalism; and abolitionism and emancipation.

As the cradle of humankind and deeply connected through the history of the transatlantic slave trade, twentieth-century colonialisms, and twenty-first century nation-states, stories of Africa and Africans matter greatly to our understanding of global exchanges of peoples, cultures, technologies, politics, and economies. But Westerners more often think about Africa as an exotic and undeveloped place of negatives that stands on the periphery of the modern world, badly in need of western help. Why? In the first part of this course, we introduce ourselves to some of the origins of negative western images of the continent of Africa. We also interrogate how popular culture and media coverage in the West perpetuates negative and often harmful stereotypes of Africa and Africans. In the second part of this course, students learn methods of writing and speaking about Africa that consider the diversity of Africa's histories, peoples, and cultures, while reflecting on our shared humanity, aspirations, and experiences.

Many opera composers, like Giuseppe Verdi and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, for example, have based their work on high literature, including William Shakespeare, Augustin de Beaumarchais, Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, and Amy Tan. In the course, we first closely study the literary model (play or story), discuss its features and suitability to being adapted as an opera, including potential obstacles. We then discuss the changes needed for the creation of a viable libretto for an opera and what music supplies that replaces or transcends words. Ultimately, we examine the opera in question and unpack the different impacts, functions, and emotional and dramatic content of the written versus sung works with an eye to the different audiences and societies of each. In the case of play to opera we also compare the theatrical acting, for example of a Shakespearean company, to the movement on an operatic stage. Works examined include <i>Othello</i> (Giraldi Cinzio to Shakespeare to Verdi), <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i> (Beaumarchais to Mozart), <i>The Barber of Seville</i> (Beaumarchais to Gioachino Rossini), <i>The Bonesetter's Daughter</i> (Tan to Stewart Wallace), <i>Moby Dick</i> (Herman Melville to Jack Heggie), <i>La dame aux cam\u00e9lias/Traviata</i> (Dumas to Verdi), and <i>The Ring of the Nibelung</i> (an anonymous twelfth-century author to Richard Wagner).",

In fact, it is a fundamental aspect of success regardless of functional role, place in the organizational hierarchy, or industry sector. In the world of business, creativity manifests as innovation. According to a recent survey of 1,500 C-level executives by IBM, creativity is the number one leadership competency required to effectively navigate our increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world. Whether operating in the corporate, startup, social entrepreneurship, not-for-profit, or public sectors, organizations increasingly need people who understand the creative process; know how to manage, motivate, and engage creative professionals; and can develop an organizational culture that encourages experimentation, considers the inevitable failures as learning opportunities, and enables innovative outcomes. This course focuses on best practices in creativity and innovation, exploring the interplay between creativity, organizational processes and systems, and successful innovation. Throughout the course we explore tools and techniques for fostering individual and group creativity, management practices that foster (or inhibit) innovation, methods for developing and evaluating ideas for new products and services, the business models to execute these ideas, and principles and practices for leading innovation. Using a variety of readings, case examples, discussions, experiential exercises, and a team project, students explore and apply the principles of creativity and innovation.",

Research shows that individuals who form and maintain strong mentoring, coaching, and sponsorship relationships are significantly more likely to succeed professionally. In this course, we explore each of these developmental relationships and discuss their unique benefits, challenges, and opportunities. We begin by focusing on how you can make the most of these developmental relationships when you are in the learning position (mentee, coachee, or sponsee). We address questions such as: what are the best ways to network so you can build development relationships? Once you are in a meeting with a mentor, coach, or sponsor, what are the right questions to ask them? How do you know when to start or end a developmental relationship? Then, we shift focus and learn how to be an effective mentor, coach, and sponsor to others. We discuss questions such as: how do you give good advice? How do you recognize the type of support that your mentee, coachee, or sponsee needs? How do you evaluate your performance as a mentor, coach, or sponsor? Finally, we discuss how organizational structures affect the extent to which these relationships can be successful. We answer questions such as: when do formalized mentorship or coaching programs work? How should these programs be designed to optimize outcomes? This course is designed to introduce you to different forms of and perspectives on developmental relationships so that you can understand the unique value of different types of developmental relationships in the workplace; learn how to create and make the most of developmental relationships when you are in the learning position; discover how to become a more effective leader by strengthening your mentorship, coaching, and sponsorship skills; and understand how organizational structures can affect developmental relationships within an organization.",

It focuses both on what responders must do during the critical period of crisis response and on how organizations can prepare themselves for high performance in these situations.

This course examines the principles, responsibilities, and practices of ethical stewardship with a focus on repatriation and restitution. We examine the historical context of museum collecting, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) and domestic repatriation in the United States, Nazi-era looting and restitution, international repatriation, archival and digital repatriation, and ethical stewardship beyond returns, including collaborative collections care, interpretation, and exhibition.

This course introduces the science of a brain (and body) healthy diet and the concepts of the neuropsychology of eating, and offers practical applications of the science that you can adopt to support your own brain health and that of those you care for. It is not just what you eat, but how. Eating mindfully means choosing foods that balance blood sugar and provide adequate levels of brain-boosting nutrients like essential fatty acids, lean proteins, and a rainbow of antioxidants. The nutrients extracted from food enter metabolic pathways that are manipulated, modified, and molded into molecules that the body can use. This nutritional psychiatry course includes opportunities to ask questions of the faculty, experience live cooking demonstrations, and engage with other members of the brain healthy community for inspiration from similarly motivated individuals. When it comes to diet, most people's concerns involve weight loss, fitness, cardiac health, and longevity. But what we eat affects more than our bodies; it also affects our brains. Now more than ever our food is something we can control. Foods can boost our immunity which is also linked to levels of depression and anxiety; studies also show a link to insomnia, dementia and beyond. This course guides students through the principles from Dr. Uma Naidoo's cutting-edge book, <i>This Is Your Brain on Food</i>, Barton Seaver's books <i>American Seafood: Heritage, Culture &amp; Cookery From Sea to Shining Sea</i> and <i>Two If By Sea: Delicious Sustainable Seafood</i>, and National Geographic's <i>Foods for Health: Choose and Use the Very Best Foods for Your Family and Our Planet</i>, and then goes even deeper with professional lessons, resources, recipes and insights.

Their ideas resonate today on a number of fronts that still cause lively debate, among them antisemitism, racism, epidemics, terrorism, suicide, feminism, capital punishment, authoritarianism, and ageism. These writers are also masters of thought and expression. We study their creative works aesthetically and intellectually, and follow their mode of philosophical thinking closely as they develop such concepts as freedom, the absurd, revolt, justice, individual responsibility, ethics, authenticity, committed writing and action, and the appeal to the conscience. Among works to be studied by Camus are <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i>, <i>The Guest</i>, <i>Reflections on the Guillotine</i>, <i>The Plague</i>, and <i>The Fall</i>; by Sartre, <i>Existentialism is a Humanism</i>, <i>No Exit</i>, <i>Anti-Semite and Jew</i>, and <i>What is Literature?</i>; and by Beauvoir, <i>The Second Sex</i>, <i>The Monologue</i>, <i>The Ethics of Ambiguity</i>, and <i>The Coming of Age</i>.

Technological innovation is all around us and new possibilities in fields like artificial intelligence, genome-editing, and geoengineering not only reallocate power, but might transform human life itself considerably, to the point of modifying the essence of what it is to be human. While ethical considerations enter prominently, the philosophy of technology is broader than its ethics. It aims to interpret and critically assess the role of technology for human life and guide us to a more thoughtful integration of technology in our individual lives and in public decision making. This course aims to teach students to do just that, starting with basic stances and key figures in the field and then progressing towards a number of challenges around specific types of technology as they arise for the twenty-first century. At times it is tech optimism that dominates these debates (sometimes even techno-boosterism that sees technology as key to heaven on earth), at other times it is more low-spirited attitudes from Romantic uneasiness to doom-and-gloom Luddism and technology-bashing. A closer look at these attitudes\u2014alongside reflection on how technology and power are intertwined\u2014helps generate a more skeptical attitude toward all of them and contribute to more level-headed debates, which are badly needed.",

We learn about intimate (romantic) relationships and friendships, and the ways in which these two kinds of relationships interact. Other kinds of close relationships (family and work relationships, for example) are integrated into the course, and although they are extremely valuable relationships in their own right, they are addressed secondarily to romantic relationships and friendships for the purposes of this course. Examples of topics include attraction and love, relationship formation and dissolution, relational interaction patterns, relationship satisfaction, and the social context of relationships (the influence of others). Students have an opportunity to explore relationships through readings in the popular press, but ultimately a scholarly, critical examination of the scientific literature serves as the foundation of our learning throughout the course. Students find that the literature contains unexpected findings that can change the way they look at relationships, both from academic and applied, real-life perspectives.",

This course gives women a roadmap to address the unique opportunities to promote protective factors of brain health and address risks of female brain illness. The course also introduces how women's brains age distinctly from men's, primarily due to the decline of a critical brain-protective hormone: estrogen. Throughout the course, students learn about multiple aspects of women's brain health, including depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, migraines, hormonal imbalances, brain fog, memory lapses, and the increased risk of dementia. The course introduces cutting-edge, evidence-based lifestyle approaches to protect the female brain, a self-care routine that includes a brain-healthy diet proven to work for women, stress reduction, physical activity, social wellness, positive psychology, and sleep. The course also examines the controversy about soy and hormonal replacement therapy; the implications of environmental toxins, including skin care, beauty products, anti-aging procedures, cleaning supplies, insecticides, and SPF; and the role of our microbiome. The brain-health implications of puberty, pregnancy, menopause, and perimenopause are still a black box to most doctors, leaving girls and women exasperated as they grapple with symptoms ranging from mood swings and hot flashes, to insomnia, brain fog, and potentially cognitive decline.

This course explores the application of mindfulness to ethical, social, emotional, existential, and developmental frameworks for AI, as well as considers definitions of intelligence and theories of consciousness, agency, and meaning making to better understand human-to-machine interactions relative to human-to-human interactions. Inquiry also draws on the Buddhist roots behind mindfulness including its texts, theories, and practices for exploring the complex worlds of the nature of mind, consciousness, attention, memory, interconnectedness, and the mind-body connection.

This course explores how social factors create health disparities in the United States. We gain foundational knowledge of key concepts in social medicine, including an overview of health care policy in the United States and the arguments for health as a human right. We then turn to what we can call chronic emergencies: case studies of people and communities who have been denied health care and allowed to suffer and die, because they are poor, uninsured, undocumented, or otherwise social outcasts. Our examples are drawn from across the United States, from the eviction crisis in Milwaukee, to injection drug users in San Francisco, to the people who endure gang violence in Chicago, to the suffering of Mexican migrants in California. We give significant attention to the lived experience of poverty, housing insecurity, addiction, discrimination, and violence.

In the final section, we turn from studying how harm falls unevenly to considering how social determinants can be incorporated into action plans; students apply the themes and concepts from the course to explore topics of their own choosing. By the end of the course, students not only have a knowledge of concepts and case studies in social medicine, but also knowledge about how to close the gaps that we study. For premedical students, this course reviews concepts found on the psychological, social, and biological foundations of behavior section of the MCAT, including how sociocultural factors and access to resources have an impact on health.",

        "course_description": "This course explores the relationship between health, place, and social location, and how nested factors influence and determine the health of people and communities in urban settings. Emphasizing health as multidimensional, contextual, and socially determined, we explore the history, principles, theories, and frameworks relevant to understanding inequities in health, as well as tools and strategies for advancing justice in health across sectors of civic and community life. We explore how inequity gets under the skin and operates on the body; discuss how racism, oppression, social stratification, and systemic advantages and disadvantages all structure and perpetuate injustice in health; how systems, institutions, and policies influence health. To understand how socio-environmental factors can create pathways to health or disparities, we explore the mechanisms by which poverty, socioeconomic status, education, housing, and the built environment create and sustain inequitable health outcomes in urban communities. Understanding the social conditions people need to be healthy, we turn our attention to approaches for advancing justice in health, with particular attention to root-cause strategies. We explore community development, capacity building, and community mobilization as strategies for building power for health. We discuss health improvement interventions and how community engagement, participatory processes, and cross-sector collaboration can help create and sustain health promoting environments.",

Increasingly, it is understood that child health depends on a complex of interrelated factors. Biologic and genetic issues are very important in determining children's health status. Societal, environmental, community, and family factors also play a major role in child health outcomes. We focus on social concerns such as economic status, class, race, and ethnicity. The American Academy of Pediatrics has called out poverty and racism as actual pathogens. We explore the American healthcare system and ask why in the richest country in the world, our child health outcomes are measured near the bottom in comparison with other industrialized nations and our black infant mortality remains twice that of white infant mortality. In light of the recent experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, we pay special attention to the impact of infections on children and compare the US response with that of other countries. We also look at the history of infectious disease outbreaks and the ways that these have been controlled and ultimately prevented. Finally, the course emphasizes the importance of team approaches among people from multiple backgrounds and organizations. Increasingly, we are understanding that if the threats to child health live in the society and community, so do the answers. We discuss strength-based approaches and the shifting of power and agency to families and communities and learn how hope and accentuating the positive are new approaches that are beginning to have success in the promotion of child health.",

Capital must be raised; a large, diverse team must be organized and deployed; and a brand must be developed and sold. The hours are long, the pressure is incredibly intense, and the stakes could not be higher. Succeed, and you are on your way to a plumb job in Washington, DC. Fail, and you are left looking for a job. Accordingly, popular politics provides remarkable lessons in compelling leadership and successful management. This course aims to harvest them by way of an analysis of recent presidential campaigns and contemporary politics. Though emphasis is placed on American politics, lessons may be applied across the public and private sectors. Our readings are drawn from history, literature, philosophy, business, and politics, and in addition to lectures and discussion, the course also features guest speakers from business, journalism, and politics.

The project includes two components: the project prototype and the academic report. The prototype is the specific product designed to address the real-world problem identified in the fall term proposal. Prototypes can take two different forms. First, they can apply research to design a project that addresses a real-world problem experienced by stakeholders. Second, they can communicate scholarship to audiences who would benefit from knowing the information (for example, a publishable article or a website explaining current research to non-academic stakeholders). Projects are based on specific interests of each student and developed in consultation with the instructor. These specialized projects allow students to seek a practical application of research on identity, while developing their skills designing research-based practice and engaging stakeholders.

This course considers thirteen possible answers to these fascinating and challenging questions by closely and critically analyzing the emotional power of various fiction films, from Hollywood classics like Charlie Chaplin's <i>Modern Times</i> and Alfred Hitchcock's <i>Rear Window</i>; to contemporary films by the renowned directors Steve McQueen and Greta Gerwig; to masterpieces of art cinema like <i>The Passion of Joan of Arc</i> and <i>Daughters of the Dust</i>. These films are considered by recourse to classical and contemporary film theory, alongside primary texts from the field of psychology. Students grasp how canonical and contemporary psychological concepts\u2014from psychoanalysis to contemporary neuroscience\u2014can help us consider our central inquiry. Moreover, by situating these concepts within relevant philosophical frameworks, students understand these theories derive from diverse, and continually contestable, worldviews regarding how humans relate to their cinematic environments. Assigned films and written texts help students develop the skills needed to write a final paper regarding a film of their choosing, so they may offer their own critical argument regarding why movies move us.",

        "course_description": "Why do we go, again and again, to movies that make us scream with terror? Why do we seek out overwhelming fear? Is slaughter really the best medicine? In this course, our mission is threefold. First, we identify the iconography and the visual rhetoric of fear, and of hope, in horror cinema and television, and examine this versatile genre with its multiple subdivisions that make horror film both exciting and popular, including horror-comedy, creature features, zombies, monsters, demonic possession, witchcraft, paranormal, slasher, psychological, found footage, action, folk horror, vampire horror, animal horror, eco-horror, analog horror, slasher-horror, and political horror. Second, we outline the screen potential of the occult, and the capacity of the horror genre to imagine an alternative future, in the pursuit of an oppositional and politically progressive cinema. Third, we investigate the ways this genre is so uniquely positioned to both dive deep into the complex terrain of the human psyche, with all its crevices, and concurrently explore a whole nation and its collective fears and nightmares. Why is this seemingly unrealistic genre the best mirror into our personal and social existential despair? Why, for all its disturbing depiction of the supernatural, do we regard horror cinema and television the best vehicle to highlight a fundamentally human experience? We examine classic and contemporary horror films and series including <i>The Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i> (1956), <i>The Night of the Living Dead</i> (1968), <i>The Exorcist</i> (1973), <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> (1974), <i>Jaws</i> (1976), <i>The Omen</i> (1976), <i>They Live</i> (1988), <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street</i> (1986), <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i> (1991), <i>The Sixth Sense</i> (1999), <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> (1999), <i>Grindhouse</i> (2007), <i>American Horror Story</i> (2011), <i>Get Out</i> (2017), <i>Us</i> (2019), <i>Midsommar</i> (2019), <i>Escape Room</i> (2019), and <i>Pearl</i> (2022).",
