In addition, POH will feature a foundational clinical experience for students to provide clinical exposure through hospital-based programs. Students will learn to diagnose active oral diseases, including the basic principles of dental carious lesions, periodontal disease, oral pathology, and occlusion. Furthermore, they will learn to assess the individual risk factors that cause the development of active oral diseases. Risk factors including nutrition, behavioral science, medical conditions, and specials needs as well as their relation to oral health will be incorporated. The current oral health care system and its impact on oral health will be described. Additionally, the student will be able to integrate basic sciences, clinical sciences, and evidence-based dentistry in the case-based format.</p>"

Building on their knowledge of preclinical dental science and pathophysiology, students acquire a sound knowledge of principles of dental and oral diagnosis and disease prevention. Students are introduced to the techniques and protocol used for documentation of patient care, including impressions, study models, radiographs, charting, intraoral photography and record keeping. Students are oriented to their treatment team and become familiarized with clinical protocol, infection control procedures, patient records, and information systems management. The role of health-related behaviors as risk factors for dental and oral disease is examined and students learn oral hygiene and disease prevention strategies. In addition, consideration is given to medical conditions that may complicate the delivery of dental care, as well as dental and medical management of patients with these conditions. In the dental laboratory, students learn the structure of teeth and their parts as necessary for planning restorations. In addition, considerable attention is given to anatomical, physiological and biomechanical relationships of the masticatory system, and the restoration of the occlusal relationship to proper function. An understanding of the instrumentation and techniques required to reproduce these relationships during restoration of the dentition is achieved. Students learn how to assemble casts on the articulator to perform occlusal diagnosis and treatment. Motor skills derived from technical training are applied by students to more complicated procedures, such as carving wax patterns to using additive and subtractive drop-wax techniques. In addition, students are required to wax-up occlusal morphology to specific determinants of occlusion.</p>"

These concepts will be reinforced with relevant textual material and topics. Through the process of discovery, the students will translate case experiences into the skills development arena in the laboratory and to clinical skills in clinical practice. The initial phase of treatment includes the treatment of acute and emergency situations. Cases will be presented that represent a variety of these clinical situations. The student clinicians will begin to identify the clinical and diagnostic skills to arrive at a diagnosis and treatment plan. Important concepts in pain control and the administration of anesthetic will translate into the clinical cases, facilitating students and their patients to enter into the treatment phase. The treatment concepts of caries removal/temporization, pulpectomy/pulpotomy, scaling and root planning, simple restorations, incisions and drainage, biopsies, and extractions will be introduced through problem-based and learning-based formats. These concepts will be enhanced in a skills development arena in the laboratory where exercises will be practiced on odontotypes and pig jaws. Clinical skills will be introduced through supervised exercises on fellow students, and finally student clinicians will move to their clinic teams to begin the treatment of patients.</p>"
