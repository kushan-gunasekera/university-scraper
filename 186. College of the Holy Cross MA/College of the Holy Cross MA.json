What are the consequences of finding oneself between competing legal systems? Why are questions of legality so often tied up with our conceptions of human nature? Our focus will be to examine critically the social and cultural dynamics behind dispute resolution, corporate law, crime, torts, religious law, and international courts, as well as dilemmas around policing and other ways people encounter \u001athe law\u001a in everyday life.

Similarly, recent scholarship on \"gender\" has disputed conventional academic wisdom of how gender and sexuality are produced, embodied and performed by individuals.  Anthropology and feminist theory have furthered these debates by offering a significant reappraisal of \"gender\" - as a concept, social relationship and category of analysis.  In this course, we will develop a critical stance toward the study of gender and sexuality by taking anthropology's and feminism's insights into account as we explore the power dynamics that play into the social construction of the body.  We will pay attention to how various peoples (including ourselves), living at different times, have fashioned social distinctions based on gender and sexuality, and how these distinctions have played a role in the organization of political, religious, economic and ideological practices.

Paying homage to Mead\u001as seminal work, this course examines the subjectivities and daily life experiences of youth navigating the conceptual, territorial and affective borders created by nationalism, war, displacement, occupation, colonialism and other social and political contexts in a variety of global situations. At a time when we are bearing (painful) witness to the suffering of those forced to navigate the unwieldy terrains of a reinstating and strengthening of borders and border walls, we will examine how youth in Israel/Palestine, Kashmir, the U.S./Mexico border, and our nation's own internal \"others\" 'come of age' by negotiating the construction of identities, movement across (often militarized) spaces, and political violence as they push up against carceral and colonial state formations.   At the same time, we will attend to the politics of such witnessing, and the potentials (and impossibilities) of ethnographic engagement with youth struggling to define themselves, their communities and their futures at the border."

With contemporary and historical primary sources along with theoretical texts, we will consider how spoken language and its representation in other modalities become mechanisms through which differences of class, region, race, ethnicity, and sexuality are produced and contested. A basic premise of the course is that language functions as far more than a mere neutral medium to denote ideas but actively shapes our identities and the material conditions of our lives. The techniques of semiotic analysis, which we will develop through ethnographic case studies drawn from diverse cultural settings, will allow for nuanced insights into how modes of communication shape the complex lived experience of public discourse, media, performance, the political sphere, religious and magical language, temporality, personhood, stigmatized speech, and language ideology. The role of language in constructing epistemic authority and legitimizing the social order will be central themes. The semester will conclude with applied independent research into language use in specific cultural contexts through the presentation of original linguistic data."

We will also discuss matters of culture, race, gender, generation, migration, and representation, and the ways that each is implicated in African cities and urban spatiality more generally.

The texts will be examined in the context of Italian women\u001as history, the twentieth-century women\u001as movement, and feminist theory. The question of gender, racial, and class identity will be addressed through an analysis of different characters and at least one novel by an Italian woman author of color. We will also pose and explore the larger questions suggested by the readings: How do the experiences of women living in another century and in another country relate to our own? Why are most women writers excluded from the literary canon? How does the woman artist/writer find her voice in a patriarchal society? Two overarching considerations of the course are whether \u001awomen\u001as rights\u001a are still considered a pressing concern by today\u001as young women and men; and whether it is still necessary to teach a course such as this one, which focuses exclusively on literature written by (cisgender) women. Finally, in addition to offering a new perspective on Italian literature and society, the course will give you the opportunity to hone your writing and speaking skills in Italian."

This course will acquaint you with nineteenth-century Italian society and cultural life and introduce you to two of Italy\u001as most important writers, Alessandro Manzoni and Giovanni Verga, and the artistic movements they represent. Our discussion of literary texts will also consider gender difference in nineteenth-century Italy. As the newly unified nation codified its laws, issues such as family structure, women\u001as education, and even feminism were very much in the forefront."

        "course_description": "How authority over the school system is and should be shared via a system of school governance is a vital question in a democracy. Importantly, this isn\u001at just a question about bureaucratic efficiency or test score trends. Rather, questions of school governance are at their heart questions about whose claims deserve being heard and how power is shared. In the words of political scientist Joseph Viteritti, school governance \u001aappropriates power, authority, and access, and it apportions these precious political commodities among those who govern and those who are governed.\u001a Answering these questions well requires both careful research on how different policies shape educational outcomes as well as ethical reflection and discussion among citizens about what we value. Notably, there have been significant shifts in the policies regulating school governance in the US over the past few decades. From increased federal and state oversight of schools to the adoption of mayoral control over local school boards, authority has over schooling has been significantly redistributed among key education stakeholders. In this module, we will focus our attention on the shifting landscape of educational governance in the US and work to understand the key values and principles at stake in these policy debates. Through readings in philosophy and political science, case study discussions, and simulations, students will: (1) learn the shifting landscape of school governance in the US; (2) come to understand a set of philosophical concepts and frameworks for evaluating normative questions in education policy; and (3) develop in their ability to engage in the ethical analysis of education policy. The work we\u001all do together in this course will be guided by three essential questions: (1) What are the relationships between different education stakeholders now? And how have those relationships evolved over time? (2) How do we balance the value of democratic control of schools with other key values realized through schooling? (3) How should authority over schools be shared?"

A toad detects a specific set of stimulus features to identify a fly as prey and executes a swift, precise predatory behavioral pattern. A species of migratory bird uses cues based on the earth's magnetic field to navigate over continental distances. In the natural world, animals exhibit elegant behaviors in response to relevant sensory phenomena. Neuroethology is the study of the neural mechanisms that serve these behaviors. Learning about these mechanisms in turn informs our understanding of how the human nervous system might produce complex behaviors.

James Joule, Sadi Carnot, and others developed what we now call classical thermodynamics, which treats matter and energy in terms of macroscopic quantities that obey the four \"laws of thermodynamics.\" Later, Ludwig Boltzmann, James Clark Maxwell, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and others applied classical mechanics and probability theory to molecules in an approach now called statistical mechanics and kinetic theory.

While the proposed term is contentious and still being debated, this course will focus on theorizations and critiques of the Anthropocene and its implications for social justice. Debates on nomenclature raise important questions regarding which geopolitical groups bear disproportionate responsibility for environmental crises, and which groups bear the brunt of their consequences. Scholars have proposed alternative terms such as the Capitalocene, Plantationocene, and Chthulucene to highlight the class, race, and gender injustices that are obscured by the term. Drawing on decolonial, feminist, and anti-racist scholarship, course readings encompass intersectional theorizing, political manifestos, and creative visual work from the Global South and Global North alongside case studies on the effects of climate change, social justice movements and activism in this geohistorical era, and the forging of transnational solidarities around alternative visions to the Anthropocene. Through in-class discussions, collaborative group activities, and creative activist projects, students will apply this knowledge towards a critical intersectional praxis that is relevant for our times."

We will begin by learning about the processes of urbanization that shape how and where modern cities emerge. We will then look at the transformation of cities that occur through and alongside deindustrialization. The focus of this course is cities and urban life from the mid-1960s through today. Throughout the semester, we will be exploring the changing nature of community in relation to the unfolding processes of urbanization, the ways in which social inequalities are experienced and reproduced in urban contexts, and the rights and regulations of people in urban spaces."

The most precarious populations have always been the primary producers of America\u001as food. Our course begins with the agrarian origins of American capitalism which has its origins in slavery and the dispossession of composite farmers in Appalachia. Here we look at how profit seeking behavior and market practices created a dependence on cash and credit and fractured the ecological balance that existed between land, food, and a peasant way of life. We move on to looking at the history of agricultural labor and migrants--including today\u001as processing facilities and slaughter houses. We will also look at the environmental effects of our neoliberal food system, namely how we have created an ecologically and economically unsustainable system; and also, how we relate to nonhumans. Finally, from a community-based perspective we trace the development of food apartheid in the US and its outcomes--racialized health and economic precarity. Using critical race studies, indigenous studies, urban studies, environmental studies, gender studies, community-based studies, and social justice as lenses students will leave the course with a broad understanding of the failure of the American food system. As an activist oriented course, students will work with local organizations on food justice efforts. Food justice is racial justice!"

Subsequent to approval of the proposal students will produce the documentary over the course of the semester. Students must be willing to offer assistance and feedback on each other\u001as developing projects in class. The course will culminate in a public presentation of the finished projects (likely to correspond with the Academic Annual Conference) (additionally, no prior experience or coursework in video or audio production is required). The final part of the course will be attendance (and perhaps some assistance) at the first Environmental Studies Film Series at the College.

Key themes include the origins of BFS, expositions of BFS orientations to research that extend disciplinary norms, and contradictions of the pleasures and costs of such an approach both academically and personally.

We will then apply these theories to some of the junctures where food and mobility intersect: culinary tourism, fast food and the Slow Food movement, immigration and culinary practices, the globalization and decolonization of food systems, and the overlaps between food sovereignty and mobility justice. These topics will open onto critical questions about global and local power relations, the politics of belonging, and our obligations to one another and to the planet. Through examples drawn from Worcester and around the world, we will deepen our understanding of how food and mobility shape who we are and the future we hope to build together."

Drawing on a broad range of media including film and visual art, we will explore the roots of the genre in Russia; the influence of Western science fiction and fantasy on its development; the role of the Russian Revolution, religious philosophy, Communist utopianism, technology, and space travel on its 20th century evolution; the role of the genre in Soviet social engineering; and new ideas that have emerged in the genre since the collapse of the Soviet Union, including the role of science fiction and fantasy in both upholding and challenging contemporary Russian imperialism and militarism. We will examine the key questions of the genre, including: the human being\u001as place in the universe; the existence of life beyond Planet Earth; mortality and its transcendence; the presence or absence of a deity; the difficulty of social progress; the role of science and technology in shaping human interaction; the ethics of scientific and technological advancement and the role of the state therein; the evolution of concepts of gender, sexual relations, marriage, and reproduction in utopian and futuristic societies; and many more."

        "course_description": "This course considers Siberia narrative as a distinct tradition (rather than a motif or sub-genre of Russian literature). Of primary importance to this distinction is a world view that regards nature as intrinsically sacred (a characterization that challenges characterizations of Siberia as a frozen wasteland or vast prison camp). While this perception of the earth as \u001aiconic\u001a is expressed in various ways from ancient oral tales of indigenous Siberian peoples to twenty-first century novels, important shared aspects of the relationship between the Siberian landscape and the people who inhabit it define, shape, and unite the tradition. In it, for example, we repeatedly see the perception of the natural world as an intentional (if not sentient) creator, whose immanence is experienced in the profound yet revelatory silence of Siberia\u001as steppe, taiga, and tundra. At its core, the Siberian narrative tradition describes the perception and experience of Siberia as a transcendent and sacred space which, I believe, may answer the following questions: What makes Siberian space sacred? What does it mean to be Siberian? What does Siberia mean to Russia?Readings, films, and discussions in this course focus on the idea of the sacred that grows out of human relationships of the various peoples of Siberia, non-indigenous natives, and other less willing residents of Siberia with its landmass and natural world. You will learn about the geology, ecology, and human history of Siberia and the belief systems and environmental philosophy that grows out of lived experience there. You explore expression and perceptions of the sacred in the following ways: narrative traditions of indigenous Siberian peoples; the rise of Russian monasticism/colonialism in Siberia starting in the sixteenth century and the development of hesychastic prayer practice in Russian Orthodoxy; the dueling views of Siberia from the nineteenth century as both a miraculous land (heaven) and a land of exile (hell); the representation of Siberia as a \u001amagical\u001a realm of creative and spiritual transformation and transcendence, which includes the \u001adiscovery\u001a of Siberian shamanism by twentieth-century Russian Avant-garde; the birth of the ecology movement in twentieth-century Siberia \u001a in part a response to Soviet-era misperceptions and misuses of the environment and natural resources -- and the role of native Siberian narrative and its ecological values. Topics on nineteenth- and twentieth-century narrative include consideration of narratives about the tsarist and Soviet prison that challenge the idea of the sacred in Siberian space. Invited lectures will combine current trends in Siberian narrative and reconsider the future role of Siberia as it relates to global warming, natural resources, and the political and economic policies of the Russian Federation."

Throughout those centuries, the Mongol invasion, the establishment of Christianity, the intrigues of its leaders and the development of a national consciousness produced stunning works of art, architecture, music, literature, and letters. This course explores these great works of art and literature within the context of the medieval period in Ukraine and Russia from the tenth century to the death of Ivan the Terrible. We read selections from the Primary Chronicles, lives of saints and holy fools, the letters of Ivan the Terrible, and Russia\u001as great epics. We will also focus on the historical, political and spiritual role of the Orthodox icon. We also consider how the medieval age as a political topic in opera and films such as Andrei Rublev, Mongol and 1612. Finally, we consider how modern writers, artists, and leaders \u001a including Stalin and Putin \u001a as well as have used medieval imagery for their own purposes.

As well as studying the cultures reflected in these works of art and the emerging technologies that played a role in their mass-production, we will read works by canonical French authors inspired by the rapid succession of artistic movements which shook the 19th-century art world. Through the identification of various artistic strategies and techniques (inc. color theory, composition, perspective, etc.), students will learn to write detailed analyses of the works studied in class. The readings and discussions will emphasize the relationships between 19th-century art and the social, technological, and political changes that took place, while visits to the Worcester Art Museum and the American Antiquarian Society will bring these artistic movements and their techniques to life. Recommended for students interested in art history, politics, history, as well as French cultural studies and French language."

We will ask ourselves how representations of volcanic eruption, earthquake, flooding, etc. effect not only the literary, journalistic, and artistic production of the time, but also human wellbeing. How does French society\u001as relationship to nature fluctuate throughout the 19th century? By the fin-de-si\u00e8cle, does modern France need re-sensitizing to nature? And perhaps most importantly, what can we learn about climate change and our own ecological crisis by uncovering the roots of collapsology and eco-anxiety in these depictions of planetary upheaval?"

We will first discuss the biology of the virus, the research that underpins our understanding of its transmission, epidemiological models of disease spread, and the biological bases of the treatments currently under development. This scientific understanding will allow us to make recommendations about ideal public health guidelines.

In this sense, monitoring, controlling, and dominating the bodies of non-Europeans constitute the core of the colonial matrix of power. In this same light, modern colonialism imposes the white body, its aesthetics, its dances as universal models of what is a human body; in direct opposition to black, brown and yellow bodies, their aesthetics and their dances that are labeled primitive or closer to nature. This colonial dualism is only sustained with violence and the absolute objectification of the European Other\u001as body. However, colonial systems were never infallible. Throughout the history of the global south, people open cracks against their oppression in infinite creative ways. In this initiative, we are focusing on the intersectionality of history and dance in the global south, as well as best pedagogical practices. Decolonial Movements examines the interconnections between cultural, social and political movements that sought liberation from modern colonialism and their understanding and employment of dance. Asserting control over their own bodies, the enslaved, the indentured, the worker, broke the infrastructures of race that aim at extracting their labor."

Furthermore, who is \u001aat risk\u001a of HIV infection and why are some individuals more \u001aat risk\u001a than others? Why, for instance, do women in SSA account for 59% of HIV infections in the sub-region, while men account for 63% of HIV infections in the rest of the world. We will use an interdisciplinary approach to examine these questions in depth. We will also explore how notions of \u001arisk\u001a and \u001avulnerability\u001a have changed over time as the epidemic increasingly evolves from a \u001adeath sentence\u001a to being a \u001atreatable condition\u001a. Throughout the course we will critically evaluate the dominant public health and biomedical approaches that have been used to tackle the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. For comparative purposes, we will draw frequently on examples from other parts of the world, such as Cuba, Thailand, the US, Europe and China. Because HIV has not been all doom and gloom, we will also discuss some surprisingly positive effects of the epidemic (e.g., improved health care systems, employment creation etc)."

With those in hand, we explore the question of what the government ought to do about it.  We then study four contemporary political theories:  liberalism, libertarianism, conservatism, and capabilities theory.  Each of these theories is deeply anthropocentric (human-centered) in its original form, but some are easier to \"green\" than others and we will test them all to see which can incorporate the values driving the different environmental positions.  Throughout we will debate whether we should green the theories (and if so, which way?) and we will repeatedly test our theories against real world issues:  what do they tell us the government should do about factory farming, organic food, wilderness restoration, environmental racism, climate change, or anything else?"

The second is: does art really reveal \"truths\" (What kind of truths? Truths about what? Can these truths be rationally articulated? If not, why should we take art seriously?)

These four feelings, when cultivated, make one virtuous for Mencius. Aristotle\u001as emphasis on reason\u001as control over emotions is complemented by the Stoic, Epictetus, who maintains that the emotions are already rational. Mencius\u001as emphasis on human emotions or feelings is complemented by the Daoist, Zhuangzi, who downplays the role of the mind/reason in someone who is wise and virtuous.

That's an unattractive result, but holists claiming that such collectives are moral agents face a difficult challenge.  The holist has to demonstrate that (1) the collective entity exists, that it cannot be \u001areduced\u001a to its members; (2) the entity qualifies as an \u001aagent\u001a, with beliefs, desires, and the ability to act on them; and (3) the entity has the additional capacities necessary for \u001amoral agency\u001a (including free will).

What is race? How have and do religious traditions co\u00f6pt race and racism as effective tools for their structure, organization, and propagation, and vice versa? This interdisciplinary course will ask students to form critical theoretical perspectives on race and religion, and to take up the above questions as they arise in the Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and American indigenous religious traditions. Spanning 15th c. Europe to modern North America, the course will also explore questions related to gender/sexuality, indigeneity, sovereignty, capitalism, nationalism, and identity."

This course examines the phenomenon of Christian martyrdom from the ancient Church to the modern era. During the semester, students will ask such important questions regarding martyrdom as: Why does martyrdom have such power to move minds and hearts? Is martyrdom a positive force or is it simply a form of fanaticism? Why were Christians persecuted during different periods of history? How did Christians understand martyrdom theologically and spiritually? Students will read such primary sources as: the Scriptures; early accounts of the martyrs, along with early theological defenses and critiques of martyrdom; and writings from such well-known and, for some, controversial Christian martyrs as Thomas More, Theresa Benedicta of the Cross (Edith Stein), Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Secondary sources will help students to enter into the historical and cultural contexts of the martyrs.

Both the world of faith and the world of fiction depend on imagination, and the Harry Potter series provides an excellent opportunity to reflect on what makes these worlds alike and what makes them different. The faith-world brings us to questions about ultimate meaning and value; so does the HP series. The faith-world has to do with self-discovery, personal growth and transformation; so does the series. The faith-world works from a sense of enchantment and divine providence; the HP series is predicated on the possibility of magic, although the ultimate source of that magic (and the possibility of dark magic) is left unexplained. The faith-world has to do with moral choices and their consequences, and so does the series. Why does imagination give permission to miracles but dismiss magic as fantasy? How and why are faith and fantasy different? How does the mind distinguish what is \"real\" from what is not? And how does the mind defend itself against dementors, chaos, and spiritual darkness?

We begin with a broad study of the ways that ancient Greek, Roman and Jewish writers conceived of the household: its economic production, religious practices, and role in larger society. We will also examine the physical structures of houses in the Roman empire in order to learn more about the occupants and their lives. Students will thus learn to draw upon both literary and archaeological evidence. We will then investigate how households, both as physical spaces and ideological focal points, influenced the development of Christian worship and theology. A major goal of the course is to understand how Christian values and theologies, as articulated in the New Testament and other early Christian literature, are shaped by the social structures in the environment, such as households. A second, related goal is to identify connections between religion, power and gender, especially in the production of Christianity's foundational texts."

Many of these drew on longer movements from the long Black Freedom Struggle, as well as other Third World solidarity efforts from over the past century. Lawmakers in the Obama years responded to Ferguson with calls for police and prison reform, including issuing body cameras, community control boards, and anti-racist training for law enforcement and prison guards. And still, in the summer of 2020, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others faced premature death at the hands of police. A growing conversation has begun to press beyond additional reforms toward the prospect of police and prison abolition. In this course, students will become well-versed in these critical conversations around prisons and racial justice including: the arguments for prison reform vs. prison abolition; the Black feminist & third world feminist groundings of abolition; the enganglemnets between prisons, immigrant detention & border imperialism; the historical background of prisons and Christian reformism; grassroots visions of \"reproductive justice\" and \"transformative justice\"; and the intersection between racial justice, and environmentalism.

In the Bible, discussions of the environment cannot be disentangled from broader issues of justice, so throughout the semester students will explore the Bible\u001as varied perspectives on the environment within the broader framework of justice. They will also learn to read in light of an \"ecological hermeneutics,\" which means recognizing that the Bible contains neither easy maxims about environmental justice nor explicit strategies, and that bridging the gap between the Bible and present-day concerns involves more than just identifying biblical texts that deal with nature, the environment, or justice more broadly. Rather, what is needed are reading strategies and interpretive perspectives that are attentive to how a wide range of biblical issues and themes intersect with and inform questions of justice. Such an ecological hermeneutic entails not only the creative and nuanced exegesis of specific texts from the perspective of land care, environmental conservation and human rights, but also the cultivation of biblical perspectives and principles that can transform our theological convictions, daily practices, and community leadership."

To aid its efforts in this vein, Christian theology would do well to look to wise guides from the past. This seminar does exactly that. Thomas Aquinas (1225\u001a1274) is acclaimed as the \u001acommon doctor\u001a of the Catholic Church, that is, the teacher who has something trustworthy and truthful to say about virtually every aspect of the Christian faith. We shall explore somewhat this \u001acommon\u001a breadth in Aquinas, but for the most part we shall focus, laser-like, on his preferred theme: truth itself, ipsa veritas. The main text we shall consider is Thomas\u001as great, yet unfinished work: Summa theologiae (left unfinished in 1274). We shall, in conjunction with it, consult secondary sources from the twentieth and twenty-first century to discover Thomas\u001as continued pertinence in our time. By examining both the \u001acommon\u001a sweep of Thomas\u001as works and his specific attention to truth, students should gain insight into not only this one author and selected latter-day followers of his, but into the vital stakes of the Catholic religion more generally."

We will read several literary texts and view eleven films plus one documentary which portray Spain at its different historical stages: the pre-Franco era (before 1939); the Spain of the civil war and the dictatorship years (1936-1975); the transition era (1975-77); and modern, democratic Spain (1975-present). Although the course is focused specifically on Spanish culture, it will foster intercultural reflection by contextualizing our analyses of the works within a global framework. Theoretical texts will help to guide our discussions on timely and universal topics such as the threat of authoritarianism; the role of democracy and democratic values; social and environmental justice; gender inequality; and human rights. Students will be expected to reflect critically on their own cultural assumptions and perceptions as we approach the study of culture from the perspective of our ethical responsibilities and civic engagement. All films will be watched outside of class. Conducted in Spanish."

How do we construct and assume Latinidad? How are Latinidades reflected in literature and pop culture? Do these art forms challenge or reaffirm mainstream\u001as stereotypes about Latinos? In what ways are literature and pop culture viable means to discuss differences and pluralities among Chicanos, Dominicans, Cubans, Colombians, Puerto Ricans, and other groups? How do questions of race, ethnicity, nationality, citizenship, and languageenter into a discussion about identity construction? Readings and other media will be in Spanish, English, and Spanglish.

What is distinctive of this phenomenon is the prominence of women writers from all Latin American countries. Some of these writers are still in their home countries but publish their short stories or novels with foreign publishers or with local independent presses. Other writers have become migrants and are writing about Latin America from Germany, Spain, or the United States. This course will focus on some of the writers who have been gaining more visibility through media, literary competitions, and whose works have been getting translated into other languages. There will be a focus on current topics, including articulations of gender and sexuality, racism, various forms of social violence, as well as the literary techniques and genres women writers use to address contemporary concerns. Liliana Colanzi (Bolivia), M\u00f3nica Ojeda (Ecuador), Fernanda Melchor (M\u00e9xico), Samanta Schweblin (Argentina), Rita Indiana (Dominican Republic), Yolanda Arroyo Pizarro (Puerto Rico), Denise Ph\u00e9-Funchal (Guatemala) are some of the short story writers and novelists we will be reading throughout the semester.

Brazilian musical practice has contributed to the formation of local and national identities, accompanied religious ceremonies and rites, been subject to the possibilities and pitfalls of industrial and neoliberal capitalism, and served as a vehicle for protest and political organizing. In this course, we will examine many of the country's major musical styles and practices, particularly as they are bound up with social and cultural trends, changes, and issues. Musics to be covered include capoeira, samba, bossa nova, MPB, tropic\u00e1lia, sertanejo, funk carioca, tecnobrega, and hip hop. We will also learn about the history and culture of Brazil, situating musical practices and meanings within their particular contexts and uses. Students will learn critical listening and music interpretation skills, which they will use to complete a research paper on a Brazilian music topic. No prior language or musical training is required."

In this course, we will explore musical styles that have become associated with particular nations in Latin America. We will read scholarship that situates these styles historically and culturally and listen to a variety of examples of the traditions in question.

This course will consider the complex relationship between popular music and gay rights over the last fifty years.  Examining the fraught notion of \u001agay music\u001a in musical, historical, and aesthetic terms, the course will also explore the role music has played in building up and breaking down certain conceptualizations of sex, gender, and sexuality in American popular culture; in shaping distinct forms of \u001agay\u001a identity (inclusive of LGBTQIAPK+ identity) in the popular media; in drawing attention to issues of voice-formation and cultural appropriation; and in forging political agency via song.

In this course, we will explore the multiple ways in which human motivation\u001aspecifically, the goals, values, needs, and desires that drive and energize us on a day-to-day basis\u001acan affect our impressions, perceptions, decisions, explanations, and behaviors. Because this field focuses on investigating everyday human thought and behavior, special attention will be paid to promoting students\u001a understanding of how motivation science can be used to understand everyday, real-world experiences. Overarching themes include how to succeed at your personal goals, how to become an expert, and how to motivate others, with the domains of education, sports, health, and relationships being highlighted."

When a new social trend in music or fashion occurs, for instance, one can use the concepts of cultural psychology to explain how it began and what it means to different individuals. This course will focus on a broad range of everyday objects\u001asuch as articles of clothing, technological innovations like cell phones, greeting cards, etc. These types of objects surround us. People interact with them often. The concepts of cultural psychology explain how such objects may come to hold significant meaning for an individual and social group. The course begins with a tutorial on the main concepts of cultural psychology. The bulk of the time, however, is spent applying these concepts to objects found in our own society and numerous others from around the globe. By the conclusion of the course, students will be prepared to analyze and explain how objects in their own life acquire the meanings they do."

During the next 150 years, Britain would eclipse its European rivals in industry, trade, and sea power.  At the height of its power in the late 19th century, Britain controlled one quarter of the world's population and one-fifth of its land surface.  This course surveys the history of Britain and its empire from the late 18th century to the turn of the 20th century.  This course rethinks certain familiar topics in British history by considering the intersections between home and empire and by highlighting how imperial considerations influenced Britain's social formation. Topics include the slave trade and slavery, rise of capitalism, industrialization and consumer culture, political reform movements (e.g., anti-slavery, Chartism, and Irish Hone Rule), imperialism, religion, and British identity."

This course rethinks certain familiar topics in British history by considering the intersections between home and empire and by highlighting how imperial considerations influenced Britain's social formation.  The aim in this course will be to foreground the ways in which imperialism was constitutive of much of the domestic history of Britain from 1901 to 2019, even after Britain lost most of its colonies.  During the course we will focus on Britain's declining role as a world and imperial power and interrogate the meaning of Britain's national and imperial identities, particularly in the wake of Brexit referendum and Brexit.  A good deal of attention will be devoted to a discussion of the two World Wars with analysis of their economic, social, and ideological repercussions within Britain and its empire."

We look at the hopes and fears the Revolution inspired, the mechanisms of power in Soviet dictatorship, the practice of repression, and the struggles of everyday life. We pay particular attention to the Soviet experience of the monumental Second World War against Nazi Germany and to the war\u001as aftermath, including the onset of superpower struggle with the US.

What led to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991? What did Soviet citizens think about the world in which they lived and the relationship of their world to that of the West? How did the USSR experience the 1960s? Topics include destalinization, the Space Race, Soviet and U.S. competition in the Third World, resistance movements in Eastern Europe, the roles of science, surveillance, and secrecy in Soviet culture, the rise of the black market, problems of bureaucratic corruption and socialist legality, the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown, and the peaceful \u001arevolutions\u001a of 1989. Above all, this class considers why Soviet leaders failed in various post-1953 attempts to reform their country's political and economic system.

During this period, the Ottoman Empire, Qajar Iran, and a semi-independent Egypt carried out a series of reforms in a bid to push back against European interference in their domestic affairs and ensure their territorial integrity. This course explores the transformations that colonial intrusions and local reforms engendered and their consequences for the peoples of the region in the build up to the First World War. In doing so, it aims to challenge overarching teleological, Orientalist, and historicist perspectives on the region as well as long-standing narratives about Ottoman decline, Oriental despotism, and \u001aeternal and inherent sectarianism\u001a in the Middle East.

This course looks at how each country portrayed its own society and imagined that of its major global foe, and the way these representations often differed from reality.

Once markets have been established, under what circumstances are markets properly subject to government regulation? Economists have extensively analyzed markets.

Markets are subject to market failures, which may require government intervention to remediate or mitigate the failure. On the other hand, governments are not ideal either. Market failures must be weighed against government failures. In some circumstances government attempts to correct market failures can produce worse outcomes than the market failure they seek to correct. In such circumstances deregulation rather regulation may be preferable. This course will cover a variety of examples of regulation and deregulation.

Our main focus will be challenges to achieving cyber security; and of building cyber security capacity in national security (including cyber war and critical infrastructure security), economic development, and international security contexts. Wherever possible, we will incorporate diverse perspectives; including global and non-western, as well as corporate, government, and non-governmental organizational perspectives. We start by working toward what \u001acyber,\u001a \u001asecurity,\u001a \u001astrategy,\u001a and \u001apower\u001a mean in different contexts; and develop an understanding of the policy issues faced by public and private sector stakeholders (e.g. the military, industry, the energy production and delivery sectors, communications, and so on). We will analyze a combination of historical case studies and current events to understand the impact of cyber events on state and non-state actors (such as terrorists and organized criminals). Familiarity with international relations theory is helpful, but no technical background is needed."

Second, we will explore how political mobilization of citizens and non-citizens shape U.S. immigration policy. We will review historical and recent immigrant rights social movements, the barriers and opportunities immigrants face, and the role political and community organizations play in shaping policy agendas. Finally, we will examine the strategies to control immigration and the consequences of enforcement on immigrants and mixed-status families. We will assess the effect of immigration policy on determining political, economic, education, and health outcomes across immigrant communities, and role of race.

While there are a number of ways of conceptualizing the politics of technology, the focus here will be on how the adaptation of technology to political life alters the practice of politics itself. Contemplating such change is particularly important in the early 21st century because we live in an age in which pundits are constantly telling us that technology will change the way we practice politics. To the extent that they are correct, it is important to anticipate exactly how such changes will affect politics; but it is also important to separate the overwrought claims that technology will change everything from the more realistic recognition that politics-as-usual is the norm. This seminar points to the question: how have the Internet and related technologies changed politics? But it does so by asking how technology has tended to change politics over time by looking at the effect of technology on politics in history, from the printing press to the railroad to television, before turning to the ways in which politics in the twenty-first century operates in the shadow of technology. Along the way we will think about how technology shapes advocacy, campaigning, government operations, policy-making, public discourse, public information, and civic engagement. American Government."

        "course_description": "Democratization\" is the process of changing an authoritarian political system - in which leaders are not chosen in free elections and individual rights are limited - to a democratic political system with regular, fair elections and extensive political and civil rights. This class will examine transitions to democracy in Argentina, South Africa, and Tunisia, explore Egypt's return to military rule, and analyze possibilities for democratization in China. These cases will test the relevance of contending schools of thought about how authoritarian regimes collapse and democracies replace them. The first are structural arguments, which suggest that the democratization is more likely the wealthier, more industrialized, and better educated a country is. If structural arguments explain democratization, why did Argentina, with the highest education rates in Latin America, also produce an extreme authoritarian regime? The second school of thought prioritizes the role of political agency, contending that the decisions of elites are central to establishing democracy. Did South Africa dismantle apartheid because of the skill with which negotiators such as Nelson Mandela decreased the white minority's fears of democracy, or because black miners threatened wealth through strikes? We will also explore the conditions under which democratization increases women's rights. Democracy can empower women's rights groups, but it can also strengthen groups with conservative views of women's role, such as Islamist movements in the Arab world and the institutional Catholic Church in much of Latin America. We will also examine the relationship between women's representation in government, women's rights in the law and women's right in practice. For example, post-apartheid South Africa has very high levels of representation of women in parliament (42%) and strong protections for women's rights in the constitution, but rates of sexual violence are among the world's highest."

This course will also explore the lasting influence of Nietzsche's work. Since it is impossible to do justice to the full range of that influence (which extends across many disciplines)in one semester, we shall focus in particular on the way he has influenced how contemporary political theorists understand power and freedom. Students will engage in close study of at least three of Nietzsche's major works, along with works by contemporary theorists (such as Foucault) who were influenced by Nietzsche, and finally one modernist novel that dramatizes (in its narrative as well as its structure) some of the ideas Nietzsche popularized.

This course explores how novels from around the globe have done so from 1945 to the present, a period of profound historical transformation, when processes of modernization, decolonization, and global interconnection remade the world to an extent that is perhaps unique in human history. During this period, English came into its own as a global literary language, animating new traditions from Africa to Asia, the Caribbean to the Pacific and making the novel in English a powerful medium for rendering diverse experiences of contemporary life. Examining major works by writers such as Chinua Achebe, Jean Rhys, and Arundhati Roy, this course will help students become better readers of the contemporary novel and the world at large."

This course aims to broaden students' understanding of the literary history informing these questions. \"Georgic and Pastoral\" asks students to consider poetry that explores the relationship between the human being and the natural world. As pastoral and georgic modes move through the late antique, medieval, early modern, and modern periods, they differ from one another in fairly consistent ways: pastoral poetry usually focuses on the lives of shepherds and rural deities living in a peaceful, natural space. Georgic poetry, on the other hand, takes up the subject of work, and tends to retain its didactic tone. Both modes, however, use these fundamental premises to engage with larger questions about human life and culture: who has the right to access land? Who has the right to evict someone else? What are the dangers of all-consuming love? What can the process of cultivation help us understand about creativity, humility, and perseverance?"

Though we will begin by studying some of Western intellectual history's foundational literary theorists (including Plato, Immanuel Kant, and Friedrich Nietzsche), the bulk of the course will be devoted to considering major movements that have emerged in contemporary literary studies (from, roughly, the mid-twentieth century through to the present). These include New Criticism, an approach that\u001adespite its name\u001ahas come to be viewed as outdated but which nonetheless gave us the widespread practice of \u001aclose reading\u001a; Post-Structuralism, an approach that focuses on challenging or \u001adeconstructing\u001a seemingly stable binary oppositions; and the distinct but related fields of Critical Race Theory, Post-Colonialism, Gender Studies, and Queer Theory, all of which urge us to place renewed focus on authors\u001a and characters\u001a identities and on the cultural and political environments in which texts were produced. Key questions running throughout the course will include: What, if anything, is unique or special about literature? Can literature give us knowledge of the world\u001aor only of itself? Can reading literature make us better people? And if so, how? Can reading literature make us worse people? And if so, should we keep doing it anyway?"

For example, biblical exegetes take seriously the literary forms at work in the Scriptures\u001anarratives, poems, etc. These, and not later doctrinal forms, are understood as the primordial sites articulating the truths of revelation. Students of literature, in turn, understand religious works to be enacting a \u001apoetics of revelation.\u001a They make the meaning and truth of revelation happen afresh in new historical situations.In this course we will examine the \u001apoetics of revelation\u001a happening in works by such poets as Dante, Milton, Herbert, Hopkins, and Eliot.

Using modern and contemporary Ireland and Northern Ireland as a case study, the course looks to writers who have influenced culture in meaningful ways. We start by studying the early twentieth-century Irish Literary Revival, thinking about Lady Gregory, W. B. Yeats, J. M. Synge, and others who imagined poetry and drama might help the Irish obtain political independence. Their ideas worked: books and plays and other cultural objects and practices really did inspire the Irish to fight for and ultimately gain their freedom from England. Since partition in 1921, Irish writers have continued to intervene effectively in public culture to make us think harder about terrorism, clerical abuses, financial crimes, feminism, same-sex marriage, xenophobia, racism, disability rights, and abortion, among other momentous social concerns. By looking at new theoretical work on activism in tandem with riveting texts from all literary genres, this course will study books and aesthetic practices that have meaningfully influenced Irish culture by asking citizens to think critically about \"real life."

But in our course, the traditional narrative conclusion of this directional movement is upended, because instead of western Europe functioning as the fulfillment of early promise, our narrative ends with the achievements of the empires of South and Mesoamerica.

Theirs was a world of visions, wonders, witches, fits, trances, signs, apostates, and apostles. Babies popped up in their cribs and offered sage wisdom! Comets portended all sorts of things. And God(s) did not exactly smile on the rich\u001aor the poor\u001aor the virtuous.Most significantly, religious beliefs and practices played a central role in the creation of gender, racial, and class categories in the modernizing world.

From the rise of agriculture to the culmination of the slave trades, Africans actively borrowed ideas, technologies, and foods, guns, and other goods from Asian and European(strangers). But they profoundly influenced these strangers as well, contributing their innovative ideas,technologies, cultural expressions, and wealth. Through close study of oral traditions, epics, archaeological data,food, autobiography, and film, we will investigate early Africans' global connections. Environment plays an important role in our study; we explore the ways that Africans creatively adapted to, manipulated, and altered the continent's diverse environments, and how choices shaped the kinds of societies in which they lived. By immersing ourselves in Africa's early history, we will also begin to understand and to critique how and why contemporary western media has come to portray Africans as (marginal) to global change. This course begins its study of global connections when the climatic changes that contributed to the rise of agriculture (after 20000 BCE), and it concludes in the late-eighteenth century, following the period of Africa's most intensive exports of slaves."

This course is based on the idea that these changes have been the result of human effort, and that the efforts of American radicals have been essential to the rise of the American democracy. It examines the thought and action of radicals of various stripe and means, from Tom Paine to Martin King, from the brutal war on American slavery attempted by Nat Turner and John Brown, to the more genteel fight against patriarchy waged by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, and look closely at the various efforts of Wobblies, Syndicalists, and Reds to advance the cause of industrial democracy."

As we will discover, such a relationship has a long legacy. From the early days of European colonial expansion, matters of health and sickness were central concerns of agents of empire. As a result, medicine was often mobilized to promote the physical and psychological well-being of Europeans in colonial settings, thereby assisting in the proliferation of European influence and territorial predominance. Medicine was intimately entwined with imperialism.In this course, we will explore the interrelations of medicine and empire across a range of contexts including the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, Africa, and the Americas. Our investigation will focus on the following overarching themes: 1) doctors as agents of imperial influence and medicine as an instrument of empire, facilitating imperial expansion through the treatment of soldiers, administrators, settlers, and local populations; 2) medicine\u001as role in the pathologization of the colonial subject and in the construction of difference between Europeans and the colonized \u001aother\u001a; 3) the involvement of public health policies in the management, control, and surveillance of colonial subjects; and 4) the ways in which nineteenth and twentieth century medical research was shaped by colonialism and empire. Further, this course will examine the role of imperialism and modern technologies in the spread of sickness and ill health, challenging triumphalist narratives of globalization and modernity. It will also address local or indigenous responses to colonial medical and public health practices. This course focuses on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries but will also examine earlier periods and draw parallels to our contemporary moment."

Important issues over the course of the semester include serfdom and emancipation; terrorism and the ethics of resistance against authoritarian power; conflicts over the relative merits of capitalism, liberalism, and socialism; strategies for managing a multi-ethnic empire; and theories of revolutionary  vs. evolutionary change.

Additionally, we will also interrogate what is politically at stake by framing our understanding of the region in gendered terms or by claiming Muslim women are inherently oppressed and therefore need our intervention on their behalf. Among the themes this course explores are the changing Islamic understandings of sexuality and gender roles, the ways in which both colonial modernity and the emerging nation-state profoundly transformed gender relations, as well as new Islamic sensibilities and their implications for the constructions of gender."

        "course_description": "Understandings of gender and sexuality shaped social relations and the nature of colonial society in Latin America. In 1521, an Indigenous woman named Malintzin served as an interpreter for Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and helped topple the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl\u00e1n. Over the following century, Black and mixed-race women in Guatemala were hauled before the Inquisition to confess to using sexualized magic to ensnare or harm lovers. Enslaved African women in Peru struggled for emancipation, gaining freedom by degrees by navigating legal and extralegal systems. These case studies allow us to analyze what gender, sex, and sexuality meant across time and space in colonial Latin America. This course encompasses Spanish and Portuguese settlements throughout the Americas from the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries, beginning with the century prior to European conquest efforts and ending with the close of the colonial period. We will examine gender roles among Indigenous communities in the pre-Columbian era, the sexual politics of conquest and colonization, the gendered dimensions of the transatlantic slave trade, and the nuances of daily life in colonial settlements. Over the course of the semester, we will address how gender and sexuality intersect with other markers that shaped peoples\u001a lives: race, ethnicity, class, and status as free versus enslaved. Students will engage with a wide variety of sources including Indigenous codices, European conquerors\u001a chronicles, Inquisition records, love letters, and slave ship registers. I have invited specialists in the field to join the class via Zoom on select days to discuss their research and its relationship to course themes. Students will grapple with a series of questions: How did people think about gender roles, sex, and social relations? How can we use gender and sexuality as lenses for examining the lives of marginalized historical figures? Which gender and sexual norms are particular to specific places, times, and groups of people? Which ones carry over into the present?"

While work and organized labor receive central attention, the course gives equal consideration to the comparative dimensions of class and cultural identity, race and gender, immigration and ethnicity, family and community. How, for example, do race and gender inequalities shape the labor market, people\u001as access to particular types of work, how much they get paid, and their experience in both the workplace and the labor movement? In exploring these questions, we will examine theories that try to understand why, how, and to what extent inequalities persist or change over time.

The class will focus on five geographical and chronological case studies: medieval Europe, early modern Europe, the Caribbean, British North America, and Latin America. Students will examine the gendered and racialized dimensions of magic, its practitioners, and its prosecution. We will start the semester by examining the practice and prosecution of witchcraft and other forms of magic in medieval Europe. The following section will address the witch-panic and large-scale persecutions that gripped early modern Europe. As we shift our focus to the Caribbean and the Americas, we will address how notions of witchcraft and magic evolved as European colonialism and the Transatlantic slave trade brought European, Indigenous, and African peoples into sustained contact. Our analysis of British North America will expand outwards from Salem whereas our discussions of Latin America will highlight varied forms of magic and the diverse array of peoples who practiced it. Colonial civil and religious authorities criminalized African and Indigenous rituals by defining them as witchcraft, magic, idolatry, or other sins against the faith. Individuals accused of practicing vodou (voodoo), brujer\u00eda, obeah, or other forms of magic faced courts in Europe, the Caribbean, and the mainland Americas. For some people, these practices were part of the fabric of everyday life. For others, witchcraft, magic, and ritual were intentional forms of resistance to colonial power structures."

These are a few ways that people across the world have participated in sports. Yet we seldom think about the historical, social, political, and economic dimensions of the sports that we love. Students will study sports in the past and present to explore how they shape, and are shaped by race, gender, class, migration, belonging, nationalism, capitalism, and colonialism. Focusing on all genders in sports, this class will include case studies of the Olympics, soccer, basketball, ice hockey, surfing, hurling (national sport of Ireland), and more. Although emphasis will be placed on North America, course materials will also take us to South America, Africa, Europe, and Oceania. Materials will include students\u001a first-hand experiences, scholarly writing, literature, music, films, podcasts, sports writing, and a trip to the Basketball Hall of Fame."

        "course_description": "In this course we are embarking on a study of sex and gender constructs in European societies between 500 and 1500 CE. We will also be stretching back to classical antiquity in order to uncover the origin of Western ideologies about the female, forward to the contemporary world, as we seek to understand how medieval legacies have shaped current concepts about gender roles. Our challenge will be not only to interpret ideologies about premodern women, however. We will also attempt to uncover their daily experiences by reading a multitude of primary sources. These works and genres run the gamut from legal code to love poem and many of them preserve women's own voices. We will also evaluate expert secondary sources that engage creatively with history. During such examination, we will look through many disciplinary lenses: those worn by medical researchers, demographers, and lawyers as well as archaeologists, literary theorists and scholars of religion. The semester will conclude with the completion of individual research projects that address a specific aspect of women\u001as medieval experience, work that takes care to acknowledge that these women lived multifaceted lives that can still impact us today."

        "course_description": "This course examines US history in the 1865-1920 period, commonly referred to as the Gilded Age and Progressive Era. The former was marked by astonishing growth in prosperity, population, industry, urbanization, and westward expansion, leading many to consider it a golden age of progress. Yet many others perceived these trends as only superficial--just as a gilded piece of jewelry has only a thin layer of gold on its surface. Beneath the wealth and excitement that marked the rise of modern America, critics argued, lay the harsh realities of urban squalor, political corruption, worker and farmer exploitation, Robber Baron ruthlessness, as well as an alarming growth in the gap between rich and poor. As a result, the Gilded Age was one of the most contentious eras in U.S. history, marked by record numbers of strikes and several insurgent political movements. But out of this turmoil eventually emerged the reform of ideas that animated the succeeding Progressive Era (1900-1920)."

It explores the diversity of work and working-class experiences, the history of labor movements, labor conflicts, and larger processes of social, economic, legal, and political change affecting work and workers. While work and organized labor receive central attention, the course gives equal consideration to dimensions of class and cultural identity, race and gender, immigration and ethnicity, family and community. How, for example, do race and gender inequalities shape the labor market, people\u001as access to particular types of work, how much they get paid, and their experience in both the workplace and the labor movement? How have the changing role of the state and shifting interpretations of law influenced workplace inequalities and struggles for justice? In exploring these questions, we will examine relevant social and economic theories to try to understand why, how, and to what extent inequalities persist or change over time."

We will explore case studies in this history: Bach, religion, and enlightened despotism; Robert and Clara Schumann's struggles with gendered expectations of artistry and family; ballet, \"The Rite of Spring,\" bourgeois morals, and the modern audience as spectacle; the Olympics as proving grounds for liberal democracy and totalitarianism; Hispanics and racial categorization in North American baseball; the transatlantic musical invasions (rock/jazz in Europe, the Beatles in America); the Cold War as culture war; Korean hip-hop; and gender in rock and sport.

Through reading, discussion, and written assignments, students will explore the development of competing assumptions \u001a rooted in various religious, political, and moral traditions \u001a about the meaning of suffering in society in terms of causes, consequences, and obligations it creates within in the larger community. It begins with the development of humanitarianism in the context of American antislavery debates. It continues through the late-19th and early-20th centuries when the emergence of total war, systemic poverty, industrialization, and public health crises provoked widespread moral concern and political response through new media technologies that brought images of suffering to wider audiences. In studying the post-WWII era, the course revisits ongoing debates over the causes and consequences of poverty in an age of affluence, explores the role of suffering in nonviolent direct action movements of the civil rights and Vietnam era, and examines the sources of modern discourses on just war, humanitarian interventionism, torture, and human rights in the present. Students will have options to explore one or more of these themes in-depth through research projects."

        "course_description": "The history of the Arab-Israeli conflict is often defined in terms of competing Palestinian and Israeli national ambitions in the land of Palestine. Yet this was not always the case. In the early years of Israel's existence, Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir allegedly declared that Palestine was \"a land without a people for a people without a land\" thus drawing on a highly polemical  argument originally coined in the mid-19th century to describe the relationship between the Jewish diaspora and the Holy Land. It implied, on the one hand, that the Palestinian people did not exist in the land of Palestine and on the other, that the Jewish people had a special/ primordial right to this land. This course takes this expression as a starting point for considering the history  and historiography of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict from the British Mandate period through the 1967 Six Day War and its aftermath. Through intensive reading and discussion about the rise of Zionism and Palestinian nationalism, the demise of the Ottoman empire, the advent of the British Mandate for Palestine, and the broader conflict between the Arab states and Israel, this course will consider the historiographical revisions that Israeli and Palestinian historians have offered in order to address the \"land without a people for a people without a land\" polemic. We will investigate the reasons for the emergence of such historical revisionism and more broadly, the implications of newer historical paradigms for the history of the conflict and for its resolution."

African American women made vulnerable to sexual violence whose resistance laid the basis for the Civil Rights Movement; working class Southerners, black and white, engaged in complex interplay that might have led to radical change, but did bring about rock n\u001a roll; Gay men in the decades before Stonewall caught in the trap of police corruption and media sensationalism.

        "course_description": "Modernity, modern, and modernization are often used interchangeably to refer to distinct concepts in history including a global capitalist system, European imperialism and Eurocentricism, the division of the world population into racial and gender categories, and a hegemonic conceptualization of a linear, progressive time. Modernity\u001as uses and abuses are a highly contested terrain not only among historians today, but among peoples who experienced, resisted, and fractured the forces of modernization. Indian historian Dipesh Chakrabarty refers to both the events and their theories as the \u001amuddle of modernity.\u001a This course delves into this muddle by studying moments in history in which Europe's 'Others' fractured modernity in multiple ways: through narratives, representations, images of dislocation and splintering, and individual and collective resistance (i.e., liberation, anticolonial, Marxist, feminist, decolonial movements). Thus, the course privileges Indigenous, African, Asian voices, knowledges, and cosmologies that point to powerful polities of difference."

The course will focus on five geographical case studies: Southern U.S. borderlands, Central Mexico, Mesoamerica, the Amazon Basin, and the Andes. We will examine the pre-contact history of each geographical case study and then examine how conquest and colonialism shaped the lives of Indigenous men and women. The course delves into several historical processes: the growth and decline of Indigenous empires, the impacts of disease and warfare that accompanied European conquest incursions, the formation of colonial economies that hinged on Indigenous labor, and the creation of hierarchies based on race, class, and gender. As Indigenous communities did not exist in isolation, we will explore how they engaged with historical actors of other ethnic backgrounds: Spanish and Portuguese settlers, free and enslaved Black people, and individuals of mixed ancestry. Students will assess the variety of historical methods that scholars."

        "course_description": "The primacy of science as a dominant way of understanding the natural world (otherwise known as the globalization of science) occurred in the 19th century and coincided with several important world historical processes including the expansion of European empires\u001a territorial reach into Asia and Africa. This course considers the relationship between science and imperialism in the region commonly known today as the Middle East and North Africa. How did imperial expansion in the Middle East shape notions of science among Europeans? How did it influence the assimilation of new scientific epistemologies and technology transfer among Middle Easterners? The Middle East\u001aa region largely controlled by the Ottoman Empire until World War I--o offers an interesting lens through which to think about the relationship between science and empire, due to its increasingly tense status over the course of the 19th century as both an imperial and a semi-colonized territory. Even as the Ottoman state worked to assert itself as a player in the Concert of Europe after 1815 through an extensive program of administrative centralization and modernization, it also faced serious threats to its sovereignty due to the expansion of Europe\u001as power into the southern shores of the Mediterranean, the Balkan regions, and the Indian Ocean/Arabian Peninsula. This dual status meant that European enlightenment ideals simultaneously held both promise and peril for Ottoman intellectuals and modernizing bureaucrats. Meanwhile, the threat of foreign intervention helped frame Ottoman debates about cultural authenticity in the wake of European incursions and propelled the emergence of \u001aIslamic civilization\u001a as an analytical category by Muslim intellectuals thereby spawning notions of a distinctly \u001aIslamic science\u001a."
