        "course_description": "The 21st century has brought with it an ever-increasing awareness of environmental concerns and their impact upon our planet. Issues such as climate change, sustainability, food production, land use, intensive farming, pollution and resource use have become part of our global conscience and have formed the center of critical research worldwide. What can we do to alleviate these concerns? Arguably, the past is an important place to begin. An understanding of how past societies managed the land, worked with animals, dealt with varying climates and landscapes and fed their populations may have important implications for the future. This course seeks to provide students with a multi-disciplinary introduction to food, farming and energy in Western Europe from the Roman period through to the late medieval. The course will thus offer an introduction to western history and its developments through the critically important lens of the environment, using a combination of primary and secondary sources. Students will also explore the connections between the west and other parts of the world: interactions between Imperial Rome and the east, the impact of the Vikings from Byzantium to North America, agricultural developments in the Islamic world and late medieval Europeans\u2019 interactions with both the western and non-western worlds, particularly in the era of the Black Death. A variety of sources and source material will be examined, and students will investigate land use, animal husbandry and nutrition through secondary works on animal and human skeletal remains and archaeological studies of Roman villas, medieval settlements and farming equipment."

It begins with the revival of pagan classical culture in the commercial and urban milieu of Renaissance Italy, and traces the diffusion of the artistic and intellectual movement pioneered there to the rest of Europe. As Renaissance culture spread, it merged with existing traditions, and thereby contributed to the Reformation, a religious reform movement that transformed the Christian religion and convulsed Europe for more than a century. The course emphasizes the interconnections between Europe\u2019s socio-economic development, its political upheavals, and its dramatic cultural achievements."

Students write articles and some produce audio and video pieces on environmental issues. The course provides Media & Communications majors with a widening of their perspective, and for those majoring in biology, chemistry and physics a furthering of their skills at communication. Also, it is geared for those focused on politics, government, law and other public policy fields because of the great impact of environmental issues on them.

Why have some histories become mythic or legendary? Are the contours of some events untellable, unknowable? How do narrative histories get used, even invented, to justify actions and to make history? How do personal and public historical narratives merge and diverge? Students will write a research paper in the course, based on primary and secondary sources."

The course explores the basic connection between the modern period and the novel as a form, noting the parallel rise to prominence of the novel and the large urban centers. By the 19th century, the novel had become the most widely read form of literature, in Europe as well as in the Americas, and thus exercised considerable power not only to express but also to shape urban readers\u2019 understanding of themselves, their desires, and their relation to their social world. A selection of city-centered novels by Spanish and Latin American writers of the 19th and 20th centuries will help students understand how writers expand our awareness of urban sites and how they develop complex sets of themes and aesthetics concerns central to the urban experience. We will study crucial interpretive and narratological issues (character development, time and point of view) while also researching the development of public architecture and urban planning in the cities in question."

Poverty exposes children to many physical and psychosocial stressors which directly affect brain development, maturation, and adaptation in response to the environment. These stressors are not limited to but include: lack of food security (resulting in malnutrition); substandard living conditions which pose health risks (noise and air pollution, overcrowding and poor sanitation) in unsafe neighborhoods, and exposure to environmental toxins like lead and asbestos. Low income children, both rural and urban, are at increased risk for experiencing psychological stressors such as: family turmoil, early childhood separation, physical and psychological abuse and trauma when compared to children from middle-income backgrounds. Very similar factors also impact the lives of new immigrant children and adults. Over time and in combination, these psychological, psychosocial and environmental stressors have significant effects on brain development and brain function. This senior seminar will systematically examine these poverty-related stressors and their effects on neurobiology.

Students will also develop a deep and historicized understanding of the currently entrenched political structures which reproduce Black exposure to the health-demoting social conditions, comparatively fewer socioeconomic resources, and traumatic social stressors that produce and reproduce shorter and less healthy Black lives. Students will also come to understand that none of these patterns are inevitable, and none of these political structures spontaneously emerged. They are the product of policies, and therefore are certainly changeable. We will examine the types of policies that have the potential to change the path of history, by creating more equitable life chances for Black people and communities. In doing so, these policies can help us better fulfill the promises of the Constitution, and create health equality."
