The course promotes student learning both in the classroom as well as through immersive engagement with a community partner organization.  These partnerships will help students look beyond the traditional engineering methods of problem identification and solution development as students learn to value different forms of knowledge produced within the communities that are impacted by real inequities. In doing so, students will come to understand the importance of engaging with problems in ways that stretch beyond technical approaches and keep socio-cultural-historical context as central to working for the common good as engineers.  Students will learn to recognize the socio-cultural-historical nature of problems and then approach solutions to these problems in ways that prioritize social justice, with an understanding of both the possibilities and limitations of technically-based engineering solutions.\nTopics covered will include human-centered and equity-centered design approaches, appropriate technology, social justice; identity, positionality, and privilege; human rights framework; ethical community engagement, entrepreneurial mindset, systems thinking, sociotechnical strategies and tools, and sustainable development goals. \nPrerequisites:  EGR 103.",

Students will learn the scientific principles used in such developments that ensure that products meet quality standards. This course, the second in a series of courses which will better prepare students for employment in the quality health science areas.  Instructors will explore how rigorous human factor engineering studies and clinical trials provide essential inputs into the product development process. The students will be introduced to concepts such as gap analysis, risk assessment, master plan, process characterization, installation qualification, operational qualification, measurement system analysis, repeatability and reproducibility (data collection / analysis), performance qualification/validation.  In a world of innovative technology, it is critical that the students gain an understanding of computer system and software validation to ensure the quality of data generation, data storage, and digital processes used in manufacturing and products with digital components using technical and practical aspects expected in the regulated life science industries.\nPrerequisites:  MED 401 or IET 401 or ISE 401.",

Related to its Integrative component within CAP, students discuss and reflect on the social impact such technology has within their lives, their future profession, and the world as a whole. Building upon the course's role as an elective within the Engineering in Human Rights Minor, these reflections focus on the role that mechatronics can and should play to foster human rights, such as protecting people from \u201cdull, dirty, and dangerous\u201d work, or ensuring how designers in mechatronics do not contribute to human rights violations. Ultimately, students scaffold their knowledge through a series of microprocessor programming modules which culminate in student teams designing, fabricating, and programming an autonomous system that could contribute to the enjoyment of human rights.\nPrerequisites:  MTH 168 and MEE 114L.",
