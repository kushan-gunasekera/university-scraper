Since a definition of racial identity is complicated and multifaceted, it is important to begin with an understanding that the African American poetic voice is not monolithic. In terms of a poetic tradition, however, one could argue that the history of social and political struggle (Abolitionism, Civil Rights, Black Nationalism, Black Feminism, LBGTQ rights, and Afrofuturism) established an artistic continuum. This tradition is shaped by intimacy, a desire for justice, joy, transcendence from suffering, and the simple and complicated wish to be free. We will discuss religion, visual culture, politics, dance, music, and comedy. Rather than reduce African American poetry to a timeline, we will follow the echoes of history, analyzing how voices and themes overlap. ",

What desire, what longing, what pain escape our ability to represent? How can we use the form of the essay to gesture toward what is missing, what cannot be represented? To explore these questions, we\u2019ll take up a form of writing called ekphrasis: the verbal representation of a visual representation. Ekphrastic essays use the essay\u2019s inherent doubt, play, and critical force to ask what goes unnoticed, to demand we look again, look harder. We\u2019ll read Walter Pater on the \u201cvampiric\u201d Mona Lisa and Virginia Woolf on war photography; watch Derek Jarman\u2019s ekphrastic film on AIDS, sexuality, death, and the color blue and John Akomfrah\u2019s \u201ccine-essays\u201d on colonial brutality, human trafficking, climate disruption.

Though the chronological borders of that period shift from region to region (i.e. Southern to Northern Europe), it is generally a given that the period of time it designates is now closed. But what if the Renaissance is best conceived, not as a historical period, but as a historical project? What if the task of the reader is to understand the Renaissance as what Hans-George Gadamer called an \u201cunfinished event?\u201d The Renaissance so conceived is an idea that we might revive, revise, or redirect. The scholarly mode that it solicits is participation. This course will harness the core insights and innovations of the English Renaissance in order to imagine alternatives to modernity, the present moment, and the imminent future. Topics may include: human, nonhuman, and quasi-human; utopia, dystopia, and worldmaking; the abundance of language; metamorphosis and transformation. Written work will draw largely on exercises of the Elizabethan schoolroom, including: commonplace books; imitations, emulations, and adaptations; exercises in impersonation; and two essays. We will focus on works by Renaissance poets including Francesco Petrarch, Edmund Spenser, and William Shakespeare but we will also reach backward to poets like Ovid, and forward to writers including Oscar Wilde, Franz Kafka, and Jorge Luis Borges.

        "course_description": "How to Live Together: Literature and the Commons December 1976, philosopher and literary critic Roland Barthes watches a mother pulling her young child, who cannot keep up, along a walkway. He is struck by the scene; he makes a note of it: \u201cshe walks at her own pace, unaware of the fact that her son\u2019s rhythm is different.\u201d A year later, the scene inspires the first of his final lecture courses, which he called \u201cHow to Live Together: Novelistic Simulations of Some Everyday Spaces.\u201d At the heart of the course was Barthes\u2019 concept of idiorrhythmy, a monastic term, the idea of \u201cindividual rhythms\u201d that exist-nonetheless-in and with a sense of community. To explore this idea, he turned to literature. This course will do that also. We will take up Barthes\u2019 notion of idiorrhythmy and expand it into broader interdisciplinary theories of the commons: \u201cspaces, experiences, resources, memories, or forms of sharing and living.\u201d How does literature, we will ask, offer us ways to think about common spaces and experiences, about individual rhythms and efforts (and their failure) to bring those rhythms into community? Literature is also a commons: we\u2019ll consider literary form, aesthetics, and poetics even as we look to literary representation, to \u201ccontent.\u201d Our literary focus will be literature in Britain from roughly 1700-1900, the period in which the Enclosure Acts took enormous common swaths of land and privatized them, the period in which rampant colonial ambitions, rising industrial capitalism, and rapid urbanization altered permanently the global landscape of common spaces and resources. Our theoretical reading, however, will range far more broadly: work on the commons moves across economics, politics, ecology and biology, aesthetics, philosophy, sociology, and, of course, literary and cultural theory. Literary authors may include: Daniel Defoe, Oliver Goldsmith, Mary Shelley, Margaret Cavendish, Olaudah Equiano, Christina Rossetti, Mary Wollstonecraft, Percy Shelley, William Wordsworth, Charlotte Smith, John Ruskin, E.M.

Tracing Ovid\u2019s narrative scenes, including the myths of Apollo and Daphne, Echo and Narcissus, Actaeon, Philomela, and Pygmalion (to name a few) across centuries of retelling, refashioning, and reimagining, we will ask: How does one body, one constellation of matter, assume another shape? What is the relation of the human body to the plants and animals and minerals that it can become? How might the design concept of \u201caffordance\u201d encourage us to rethink the capacities of form? Most importantly, we will attempt to answer these questions through two distinct, historically competitive, but mutually generative modalities of inquiry: the verbal and the visual. Co-taught by a literary critic who specializes in poetry and poetic theory and a painter who specializes in figure drawing, course readings and assignments will move across these fields, requiring students to both analyze and create, write and draw, describe and make.

We will ask three questions: first, what is 19th-century Britain-powerful, wealthy, imperial-so afraid of, and why do those fears (of colonial uprising, of modern science, of women\u2019s rights, of working-class insurrection, of sexual desire) take shape in literature as reanimated corpses, vampires, specters, immortal libertines, and human-animal hybrids? Second, how do the ascendant literary forms of this era try to manage that fear or, conversely, what literary innovations emerge from the failure to manage it? And finally, we will ask about the changing nature of fear itself in nineteenth-century Britain, from the cathartic fear that complements Romantic sublimity through the disciplinary fear imposed by institutional capitalism to the hysteria, anxiety, and neurosis of late century psychoanalytic thinking.

If the rest of literature is the visible spectrum, the essay, for Edward Said, is ultraviolet light. For Alfonso Reyes the essay contains the possibility of utopia; for Valeria Luiselli and Julietta Singh, it can contain the archive of all we repress or cannot tell. And for Cheryl Wall the essay is a fugitive genre, allowing those who are not free to write freedom. If essays have been compressed and standardized to five neat paragraphs in the U.S. educational system, elsewhere \u2018throughout history, and across the globe\u2019 they are expansive, resistant, creative, subversive. Most of all, they are experimental: they try things out. (\u2018Essay,\u2019 from the French verb \u2018essai,\u2019 to try.) Essays are experiments, efforts to say what it is hardest to say, to create \u2018strange bridges\u2019 where there are none. This is a class in a literary form that tries to bridge public and private, world and self, what is and what might be, to bridge what has been suppressed by history and what nonetheless emerges, unbidden, as the resistant possibility that things can change. We will explore the essay in its many varieties and subgenres: the protest and the personal essay, the critical essay and the satirical one, the essay written to reveal and the one written to resist, the essay as it manifests in photography and film and on the internet. We will read essays and theories of the essay from the form\u2019s origins in the sixteenth-century to its renaissance in the twenty-first, and from Argentina to France, from Hungary to Mexico, from Nigeria to the United States. And we will write, in different modes (creative and critical, verbal and visual, personal and dispassionate), in order to explore the essay\u2019s protean potential to the fullest.

While the course focuses mainly on sites within historical Iran, it also considers the recasting of Persian architecture in more recent centuries in such distant locales as Honolulu, Copenhagen, and Kuala Lumpur. In doing so, we balance the study of Persian architecture between the past and present, local and global, and a wide variety of stakeholders and interests. Letter grade only. ",

We will consider why the topic of human nature became a central one in philosophical expressions, and how varying cultural contexts brought out innovative redefinitions. By taking this course students will also learn to navigate major historical phases of Chinese premodern history. ",

Here, through close reading and discussion of battlefield harangues and Assembly deliberations, of despotic tyranny and democratic nudging, we will explore together the contours of these ancient Greek conversations as leadership evolved and eventually began to be theorized.

In order to develop our own answers to these questions, we will conduct a theoretically-informed exploration of the intersections between gender, sexuality, ethnicity, social class, and political status in the ancient Roman world. We will draw on literary and material evidence, including poetry, medical texts, architecture, and visual art. By utilizing feminist and anti-racist approaches and actively making thoughtful comparisons with our own lived experiences, students in this course will become a community of scholars engaged in a meaningful inquiry into gender and sexuality in Ancient Rome and today.

        "course_description": "The social sciences have an account of art. What can art tell us about the social sciences? Ralph Ellison worried that sociology would reduce songs, jokes, and stories to culture, and reduce persons to data; his friend Albert Murray simply called sociology \u2018the folklore of white supremacy.\u2019 Hannah Arendt assigned artworks the important task of maintaining a space between individual persons to prevent their collapse into a mass of social stuff. Jane Jacobs believed that economists and city planners fundamentally misunderstood the aesthetic nature of markets and cities. George Kubler proposed to reassign the entire category of artifacts, \u2018desirable things\u2019 that humans make, from cultural anthropology to art history. These five twentieth-century American writers tried to redefine the concept of culture so as to make it useful for art and artists. The goal, in Kubler\u2019s words, was to create a kind of renaissance, a \u2018type of society in which excellent art inevitably and necessarily appears.\u2019 Perhaps they lost that argument; the successes of sociological approaches to literature suggest that they did. In this seminar, we will run the test again. We will also consider some examples of social theory by Du Bois, Moynihan, Elster, Fields, and Patterson; some songs, jokes, and stories; and selections from Vico and Tocqueville, two earlier writers who would have loved the social sciences.

But among his other writings are: the first scientific treatise in English; an account of a meeting of the birds that he happened to overhear one day; a collection of life-stories of prominent women in history; descriptions of visions that appeared to him in dreams; and his masterpiece, the finely-wrought monstrosity called Troilus and Criseyde. Characteristic of all of the poet\u2019s works is an uncompromising irony; a filthy sense of humor; and, perhaps, a mystical knowledge of the true nature of things. This course consists of an introduction to Chaucer\u2019s language (Middle English); advanced analysis of his writings; and research into their modern interpretations. Letter grade only.

How did the Cold War and the specter of Communism, and domestic social movements such as the civil rights movement, the New Left, and feminism affect literary history (and vice versa)? How did the formal techniques of modernism give way to postmodernism, and what role did the growth of universities and the rise of creative writing programs play in this process?

Should this hybrid form be classified as a species of nonfiction journalism that borrows some of the formal techniques and cultural prestige of the novel, while continuing to be bound by the strictures and standards of factual reporting? Or do nonfiction novels lie closer to the heart of the novel\u2019s tradition, given the form\u2019s historical origins in a hazy gray area between reality and artifice, fiction and fact?

        "course_description": "This lecture and laboratory course explores the physical and biological patterns and processes of inland waters. We begin by reviewing the hydrologic cycle and discussing the physical processes that occur in headwater streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and estuaries. Early seminars introduce the chemical processes and \u2018signatures\u2019 of headwaters and gaining surface waters. The course is structured to focus on different types of systems separately, e.g. streams, lakes, wetlands and estuaries while demonstrating that many of the same ecological processes and phenomena occur in each, i.e., biogeochemical cycling, controls on primary production, evolutionary selection, community patterns, population dynamics and food web structure. The most visible taxa in aquatic systems will be introduced including algae, plants, fish, birds, amphibians and reptiles via laboratory and field work. The course will discuss how drinking, irrigation, recreation, transportation, flood control and power generation compete for water resources, altering the ecology of inlands ecosystems. Case studies will integrate ecological sub-disciplines while highlighting the human-nature conflicts in freshwater systems. Students interested in watershed and marine systems will find the course extremely useful in their understanding of how various biota co-exist in these seemingly simple systems. There will be two weekend field trips for the course. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: ",

Specifically, participants will explore real-life issues, such as the criminalization of poverty and welfare reform, and consider how social and ecclesial appraisals construct poor Black women as unworthy of moral concern.

To meet intellectual, social and political challenges that included state persecution. Buddhist leaders poured their efforts into rearticulating Buddhism under a spectrum of approaches defined by two polarities: (1) conservatives who emphasized restoring Tradition and (2) progressives who favored modernization. We will look at the Buddhist adaptations to modernity, particularly the modern state, from the perspective of religious history, exploring how metaphors of \u201cTradition\u201d versus \u201cInnovation\u201d can be used toward the preservation and revitalization of religion.

Some of the topics that will be discussed in the course include the nature of the self, the function of funerary rites, the geography of the afterlife, communication with the dead and religious notions of salvation/liberation. By exploring a variety of narratives and practices regarding death and the afterlife, students will develop a rich and detailed picture of the relationship between the living and the dead in the East Asian religious landscape.

Along the way we question what we mean by \u201creligion\u201d and what we mean by \u201cqueer.\u201d We consider how sexualities and genders are shaped in and through religious practices, texts, and traditions. We consider the intersections of religion and sexuality with transnational politics, ethnicities, cultures, and power relations. We consider how religious traditions can push back on received norms and create space for queer gender expression, identity, and sexual practice. The course will pay particular attention to how we research and write about queer religious phenomena. Letter grade only. ",

The concept of authority (walaya) not only includes political power, but also extends to protection, friendship, alliances, legal guardianship, migration, knowledge, and worthiness. The spread of Islam through conquest and trade brought Muslims into contact with a variety of religious communities and established political cultures. In many places governed by Muslims, Muslims remained a minority for many centuries. The gradual conversion of conquered peoples to Islam and the normalization of relations with non-Muslims exposed the broader Muslim community (umma) to new literature, ideas, technologies, and political practices. We will also look at how marginalized Muslim groups leveraged Islamic ideas of authority and leadership to spark protest and political revolution. ",

Through a range of theoretical texts and in conjunction with detailed analysis of select films and media, this course examines and debates the various, competing accounts of depicting, disseminating, and consuming images of violence. How did the omnipresence of scenes of violence on screens become a transnational phenomenon? Why does it have the power to move, excite or titillate us? What is our responsibility to images of violence, if any? These are some of the questions we will address as we chart the history of screening violence from early film and media to the present.

How do filmmakers use color, sound, lighting, movement, editing and space to create embodied experience? This course is an introduction to these and related questions by examining both cinema\u2019s bodily representations and the relationship between the viewer\u2019s body and the events on the screen. Our approach is organized around a diverse cross-section of film screenings that include art cinema, experimental cinema, Hollywood melodrama, global cinema, and body horror. Turning attention to what is at stake when we consider what it means to feel cinema permits a wide range of critical approaches to screen media including continental philosophy, media theory, genre theory, experimental cinema, and feminist thought. Throughout the semester, we will become better acquainted with the sensuous facets of cinema along with the social, political, and aesthetic possibilities cinema affords when understood as both appealing to a sensuous body and being a sensuous body in its own right.

But to study seriality is not just to observe an industry strategy for releasing narrative. Nor is it sufficient to simply acknowledge how seriality ensnares author, text, and audience. The study of seriality involves excavating and articulating a comprehensive theory. Looking to psychoanalysis, existentialism, radical feminism, and Black Marxism, with supplemental examination of narrative, audience, and authorship studies, this course will aim to understand seriality as a textual, social, psychical, and political form.

Most of the courses\u2019 emphasis is on this last period and security interventions with a focus on Trans-Saharan and Horn-of-Africa countries. Letter grade only. ",

Next, we analyze the causes of poverty, focusing on the historical structures of governance that maintain systems of inequity. Then, we contemplate the correlations between corruption, conflict, citizenship, climate change, and poverty.

The second half of the course will introduce a new theory that offers an acquisition-based explanation for some core properties of adult syntax. We will read and discuss these new proposals, consider predictions of these proposals, and students will test those predictions using already existing child language data (CHILDES). The expectation is that students will have some background in relevant issues so that everything is not entirely new, and as such a variety of prerequisites are included (with the expectation that students will have taken at least one). But it is unlikely that any student will have background in all the areas that the course covers. Students ought not be deterred if they don\u2019t have exposure in some areas that the course touches on: all necessary background will be provided during the course through readings and lectures, including technical skills for using the CHILDES corpora.

The global rise of black comedy as a commodity and marker of identity in the 21st century demands that we reconsider how black cultural formations like comedy are embodied, evaluated, and critiqued within American culture. This seminar serves as an introduction to the history and practices of black comic cultures, and focuses on major themes, styles, and historical events that inform contemporary genres of black comedy. We will use comedy as a means to help us think about how American cultures and identities have been shaped, challenged, and transformed by way of performance. Letter Grade Only. ",

This course attempts to pull from the margins the cultural and political expressions of black lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people. We will examine both the uneasy structures of black queer life and extraordinary strategies black people have developed for navigating them, discussing how black sexuality is made visible and invisible in popular culture, academic, and political discourse. We will examine representations of black queer poets, musicians, political activists, and filmmakers, in which relations between race, sexuality, and cultural identity are explored. This course will contextualize and expand black queer archives, including visual representations, poetry, autobiography, political essays, fiction, music, and film, with current interdisciplinary scholarship in black queer studies.

We begin by looking at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then ask why it is that so many similarities remain between languages separated by great distances. What do these similarities, called language universals, reveal about human cognition? Turning subsequently to modern migrations, we interrogate what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like \u201cthe market\u201d and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from many different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), and also the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations.

The primary aim of the course is to familiarize students with the linguistic anthropological approach to language, according to which language is a social tool with significance for sociopolitical processes, on the one hand, and basic research methods in linguistic anthropology, on the other. The course has two interwoven parts. The first is the sequence of readings, which will be analyzed in particular for the evidence and methods on which they draw. These readings trace the development of linguistic anthropology chronologically, beginning with the branching of linguistics into the fields of theoretical linguistics and linguistic anthropology, then examining early linguistic anthropologists\u2019 inquiries into linguistic relativism and whether language shapes thought, before turning finally to contemporary semiotic approaches to language, illustrated through selected ethnographic examples. The second part of the course is a field practicum in which students will observe language in the social setting of their choice, produce field notes, and draft written analyses guided by questions that we will consider at length. Via their fieldwork students will become adept at using a range of methods for collecting data and analyzing how people use language, including participant observation, interviews, field notes, audio recordings, and discourse analytic transcriptions. The course also has a writing-intensive overlay; accordingly, throughout the semester students will write up a series of shorter ethnographic analyses that they will then revise and collate into an original research paper.

That is the tension inherent in the essay: a global, culturally rich form in writing, photography, and film that both makes the world strange and holds it intimately close, a form that criticizes the world and also loves it. If we are conditioned by our education to think of the essay as academic, five-paragraph, caught up in the power, conventions, and privileges of the academy and belles lettres, this course explores a different way of writing, photographing, filming. Since its formal inception in the sixteenth-century the essay-associative, digressive, fragmentary; filled with the presence of the author-has been defined and redefined as everything from a stay against fascism to the \u201cwriting on the walls of the prison house of culture,\u201d a way of resisting the deadening status quo, a \u201cmatter of life and death.\u201d We will study the history of the essay as a form and write, photograph, draw, and film our own essays in order to understand what the essay is, how it works, and what social and political force it might, and does, have. A course in literature, film, and visual anthropology (taught by faculty from English and Anthropology), we will be thinking about the relationship between powers of resistance and modes of representation.

We will also look at conspiracy texts through four hermeneutic terms: lost cause (and Lost Cause with the objet petit a), foreclosure (forclusion), ressentiment (paranoia and castration), and information (knowledge).

We will attend to the incommensurability of migrant and indigenous frameworks, even as we move through the persistence and at times concurrence of multiple forms of colonialism that connect Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Some questions we will address include: How do historical contexts (i.e. the Cold War, 9/11, Japanese internment) affect Asian American gender formations? What does the popular (Orientalist depictions of Asian women from Geisha Girl to Tiger Mom) have to do with the geo-political (U.S. economic relations with Asia)?

In this class, \u201ctrans\u201d will act as an umbrella (if a potentially insufficient one) for multiple modalities of gender-nonnormativity, including transgender, nonbinary, intersex, and Two-Spirit identities. We will discuss how gender-variance enables contestations of colonial-imperial and racializing ideologies of gender. To these ends, we will center the intersectional dimensions of gender-variance by examining its interlocking and co-constitutive relations with race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, disability, mobility, and citizenship. Given trans studies\u2019 critiques of academic disciplinarity and nation-based analytical frameworks, this course will embrace transdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transnational approaches.

In addition, we will explore the political implications of how the body is theorized. Rather than perpetuating a universalist understanding of the body as ahistorical or demanding an over-determined particularity around the body that neglects forms of relationality, we will seek to balance questions of bodily matter and experience with gestures towards relations to another. We will read scholars such as Hortense Spillers, Saba Mahmood, Michel Foucault, Susan Stryker, Anne Fausto-Sterling, Jean-Luc Nancy, Mel Chen, Bryan Turner and Gilles Deleuze. Prerequisites: ",

We will look at dance as a vehicle for achieving political goals, for representing the state, for building ethnic identities, for demonstrating national pride.

The economic analysis of politics, also known as public choice or political economy, presents a coherent analytical framework to tackle these puzzling questions. It starts with the observation that individual motivation in politics is not fundamentally different from the motivation of market participants. Therefore, economists can apply their analytical tools to analyze the behavior of political actors. With the rise of behavioral economics, economists have started to apply models of bounded rationality to the study of political processes. This course will cover the standard rational choice approach and end with a discussion of current research topics in behavioral political economy. The course comprises four parts: (I) normative foundations (ethical theories, collective goals, Pareto concepts); (II) social dilemmas (externalities, coordination failure, commitment problem); (III) possibilities and constraints of public policy (strategic adjustment, dynamic inconsistency, special interests); (IV) current issues in behavioral political economy (populism, the role of the media, irrational voting). The course will not discuss politics institution by institution.

        "course_description": "This course uses an economic perspective to analyze demographic change, including recent dramatic changes in fertility, mortality and marriage in both industrialized and developing countries. \u00a0Microeconomic models are used to analyze individual and household decisions regarding demographic behavior, including fertility, marriage and family organization, human capital investment (health and education), migration, and labor force behavior, as well as many factors that influence or are otherwise related to these outcomes. \u00a0We will examine causes and consequences of changes in human populations (e.g., size, age structure, gender balance, health, wealth) using an economic framework. Causes and consequences of variations across time, space and subgroups in fertility, mortality, family structure, human capital investment, labor force involvement and migration will be considered, as will impacts on populations and subgroups of natural disasters, wars, pandemics, macroeconomic events, government policies, technology change, and changes in human longevity. \u00a0Demographic and economic data for a wide variety of countries are used to demonstrate the interaction between economic and demographic change at the macro level. \u00a0We will analyze implications for public pension systems, health systems, economic growth, the environment, inter-group conflict, and government budgets. \u00a0Basic techniques of demographic measurement and mathematical demography are covered, with emphasis on hands-on analysis and presentation of demographic and economic data. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: ",
