How did this new immigration of blacks change relations between the overall black population and the rest of the country?  What are relationships like between the various black ethnic groups?  What are their religious, social and political conditions?  What kinds of relationships have they maintained with their home countries?  What roles are the new black immigrant groups in the country playing in the relationships between African Americans and the people in their home countries?"

Quite often, even seemingly inaccurate estimates of such unknowns can lead to large monetary gains for a company if the new knowledge can lead to a discernable difference in performance. This is the domain of predictive modeling \u2013 using historical data to determine the value of an unknown. The course covers both classification and regression techniques.

Despite the growing importance of other data models, like schema-free and distributed-data models, the relational data model still reigns supreme in many application domains. The overwhelming majority of business data is still stored in relational databases, and any business analyst needs to understand how to extract data from them. This course provides thorough coverage of SQL. The course also covers data warehousing concepts, as analysts will need to design data warehouses for end users to perform their data analysis. Another important topic in the course is database design. While business analysts might not design databases for mission critical processes, they might be called upon to design departmental databases. This will require an understanding of database design diagrams. With this in mind, the course also covers the use of Entity Relationship Models for database design."

In contrast, in this course, students will face a more unstructured, realistic scenario, similar to those that data analysts encounter in their work. This unstructured environment will help students integrate their structured learnings and mature in the process. Their learning is also enhanced because of the sense of ownership that they feel in doing projects of their choice. Students will be expected to come up with their own projects (with some guidance) and then to execute the entire process. Project teams will identify a problem of significance and use the techniques learned in the MS in Business Analytics to suggest solutions. Students will go through several iterations of work within each phase, based on discussions with the instructors."

The nature and logic of scientific laws, theories and explanations, which are at the core of the scientific enterprise will be discussed and critically evaluated. Criteria for evaluating the truth of a theory will be explored and compared with the nature of a paradigm shift in science, as explicated by Kuhn, looking at how this interpretation redefined how changes in established scientific thinking occurs. Theoretical frames are introduced and how they provide a different yet related lens through which to view empirical data. Chaos and String Theories will be discussed and compared to all of the traditional scientific theories. The end result should be an appreciation of how this very abstract yet logically-based thought process prepares students to write in a graduate Ph.D. level program and cohesively integrate ideas together to form derived conclusions using traditional scientific form."

Steeped in myth, ritual, and history, these authors used their plays to examine the rich texture of life woven together by faith, politics, family, and community and, by whose intersection, results in conflicts and choices that reflect a deeper, transcendent meaning. Through the readings of Thomas Merton and examples of ritualistic theatre found in the Bible, the course builds on the lessons of CORE I and II to explore further Catholic principles and intellectual Catholic tradition expressed by themes found in Irish drama. As a CORE III course, students will read Irish plays, view their performance and discuss the common themes of belief, choices and the flaws of motivated reasoning that form biases in poor decisions versus transcendent ones that are the foundation of Irish drama."

In the process, the course looks at how human rights and international justice grapple with racial discrimination, reparations, and apartheid. The final section of the course reflects on recent developments in both scholarship and advocacy."

Mitigation of foreign and domestic terrorism can therefore present compounded challenges to public safety and organizational efforts to lessen threats and nefarious intentions of terrorists. The establishment of operational baselines and the identification of anomalies within these baselines has proven an effective tool for this mitigation and the recognition of danger prior to its onset. The continued ability of organizations to effectively concentrate on risk management strategies and apply essential communication and tactics before a critical incident, then becomes the focal point of enhancing public safety. This \u201cleft of bang\u201d mentality postures organizations to alleviate casualties \u201cright of bang\u201d. The implementation of the incident command structure when planning for large scale events or critical incidents is a pivotal aspect of this posture when utilized with the proper protection methodology.\nThis course will provide a framework for organizational preparedness prior to a critical incident from a large-scale security event to a terrorist attack. The implementation of the incident command system, coupled with essential risk management strategies, will be outlined as they relate to organizational cohesiveness and effective organizational execution. Through research of various critical incidents \u201cright of bang\u201d, students will correlate planning strategies prior to the event with incident outcomes and operable command dynamics post event. Essential preparedness models and theories will be researched and extensively examined, to provide clarity to effective practical application of public safety critical incident prevention and mitigation models."

EU citizenship, the status of women and the achievement of an internal market will be considered as a basis for examining core values and assaultive challenges. New developments will be examined such as keeping the peace with NATO, intervening in Kosovo and coping with the stance of the Russian Federation, including their Eurasian Economic Union and its oil interests.   All-consuming discussions of what Brexit means for the European constitutive treaties dwarfs the crisis in Turkey, the threats in Hungary and Poland and the need for fuller relations with Africa.  Other challenges demand legal and political attention.  Finally, the culture of corporate and political corruption, security, crimes-and-justice, the status of refugees and forgotten peoples in an age of terrorism and the state of the people's trust and confidence in the institutions of the EU have only become more important in the wake of Brexit.\nThere is an optional fall break one credit travel component (see below) that may be taken by the students in this course. This course fulfills the requirement of EU law and an EU paper that is necessary for application to the European Court Externship Program (Dean Acheson Stage \nProgram). \nThis Seminar meets one night a week in the fall for two hours.  The student may choose 3 credits, which requires a 25-page paper fulfilling the AWR requirement or 2 credits, which requires a take- home examination instead of a paper."

Individuals such as legislators, public officials, police officers, judges, and prosecutors are either elected or appointed as guardians of the public\u2019s interests.

        "course_description": "In today's difficult social and economic times, one of the greatest challenges facing law enforcement organizations is to develop and maintain effective communication with their personnel and to increase their ability to better service the needs of the public and their constituents. Executive leaders, front-line supervisors, and task managers for organizations must be able to identify internal and external factors influencing their agency and be able to readily adapt in complex, continually changing environments. These specific roles and correlating responsibilities, when relating to the overall health of the organization, must be clearly defined for optimal adaptation and efficiency in daily operations and long-term public safety goals. This is especially a critical task among law enforcement agencies as they are entrusted with the protection of life and thus have a greater need to develop interdependent relationships, not only within their organization, but with partner agencies and the diverse populations to which they serve. To achieve the mission statement of an institution of this nature, trust, and common purpose from the executive leaders to the front-line operators, is essential to transfer an organizational problem to organization success.\nThis course provides a framework to examine these challenges organizations face in today\u2019s critical operating environments and offer an opportunity for significant personal and institutional growth through knowledge and information sharing amongst agencies. More specifically, participants are guided to examine their own paradigms, critical experiences, and personal dilemmas and how they relate to organizational leadership throughout the course. Modern solutions to today\u2019s complex problems regarding public safety will be examined in depth.\nCoordination within and agency and across various disciplines is essential for organizational success but communication amongst various agencies, with a common purpose and focus on public safety, is a critical force multiplier for the overall mission of law enforcement. The overarching goal of preparedness and subsequently response, if necessitated, can only be accomplished when organization\u2019s goals and objectives align, are communicated between agencies, and are established, practiced, and continually enhanced."

For example, students may negotiate and draft agreements between providers and hospitals, conduct investigative inquiries using redacted medical records and other investigative materials in a professional licensing investigation, and research, draft, and promote model health legislation from an advocate\u2019s perspective. \nThe course is graded High Pass, Pass, D, or Fail based on attendance, class participation, preparation for simulations, and writing assignments; there will not be a final examination.
