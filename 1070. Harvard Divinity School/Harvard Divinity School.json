        "course_description": "<p>The history of Jewish politics and religion is a complex story. Since Jews lived most of their collective lives outside the normative politically sphere (empire, monarchy, nation-state etc.) there is a question whether Jews had a political tradition at all before modernity. The multi-volume <em>The Jewish Political Tradition</em> argues that indeed Jews thought deeply about politics and developed a variety of political traditions even though they were void of much political power. This course will begin with <em>Political-Theological Treatise</em> of the 17th century philosopher Benedict (Baruch) Spinoza and his notion of Judaism as a political religion, and then turn to Karl Marx&rsquo;s famous essay &ldquo;On the Jewish Question.&rdquo; These seminal texts will be our frame to look at how later movements continued to engage the ideas raised in both Spinoza and Marx.</p><p>We will then pick up the story a bit later &ndash; in the 20th century - when Jews became embedded in the political traditions in the U.S. and began to develop a political tradition of sovereignty in a Jewish national movement known as Zionism. Religion remained part of this political story in both overt and covert ways. This course will focus on political and religious radicalism, the figures and movements that offered radical political alternatives, both left and right, progressive and reactionary, ideological and social. The movements will cover the span of the 20th century from labor unions and Jewish communism and socialism in early 20th century America, to the Hebrew Canaanites, the new Religious Post-Zionists in the 21st century and the feminist and Queer revolutions in Judaism.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p>Mystical religion almost always challenges the normative religious tradition in which it is embedded. The focus on the subject, the experiential, and testing the elasticity of doctrinal or behavioral norms, mysticism in some way comes to define aspects of internal heretical positions. This is certainly the case in Judaism. From its appearance on the Middle Ages with the Zohar and later forms of kabbalistic teaching, the suspicion of heresy in mysticism was often a concern expressed by Judaism&rsquo;s rabbinic elite. This concern was justified in the Sabbatean heresy in the 17th century where a false messiah Sabbatai Zvi shook the Jewish world with claims that redemption had arrived, and prophecy restored. Tragedy unfolded as Sabbatai converted to Islam and his followers developed a mystical messianic doctrine that necessitated his conversion. In its wake came two other messianic/mystical iterations, the heresy of Jacob Frank (1726-1791) and the emergence of Hasidism (late 18th century).</p><p>This course will explore to nexus of mysticism and heresy in the Sabbatean movement and its aftermath, Frankism, and the rise of Hasidism. Through reading primary sources and scholarship, we will pay close attention to the underlying ways these movement contribute to the fear of heresy and expanding the boundaries of what constitutes heresy in Judaism. We will conclude with some readings on neo-Hasidism and its relationship to both Sabbateanism and Hasidism in a more pluralistic religious context.</p>"

Jacobs, a woman of African descent who was enslaved in the U.S. who harnessed her spiritual power to navigate her way to freedom. We will engage in a close reading of her book, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl Written by Herself, and we will examine her life as an epistemological site for understanding what it means to be a racial justice and healing practitioner rooted in love. We will also read and incorporate a few supplemental resources including the Report of the Presidential Committee on Harvard &amp; the Legacy of Slavery (2022). Students will learn about the spiritual technologies Jacobs employed that fostered her spiritual, psychological, and emotional fortitude, resilience, and spiritual resistance, and will identify lessons and strategies to sustain themselves in their justice work. This course is a journey for students committed to prioritizing eradicating racism in their work, from the inside out, through a healing framework rooted in love. It is for emerging scholars, leaders (faith and others), practitioners, abolitionists, and people committed to the work of reparative justice who desire to develop their capacity to become spiritual activists who employ spiritual and ancestral technologies for inner and social transformation. This will not be a religious space, but a holy space to breathe and to cultivate intimacy and connection through restorative justice principles and practices. This journey will include a pilgrimage to Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, MA where Ms. Jacobs is buried.<br />This is a seminar class with limited enrollment.

This course will pay close attention to the complex layers of communal conflict and/or challenges by distinguishing between technical and adaptive challenges. Students will be taught to attend to what matters most in each situation and how to motivate substantive and sustainable responses to adaptive problems.

They been understood as similar divine persons, who descend into this world and are embodied here, gather followers, offer wise instructions, save their devotees, and are best approached by love and devotion. But differences have often been emphasized. For centuries, missionaries, scholars, and many ordinary believers have seen Krishna and Christ as competitors., pushing similarities and differences in contexts (most often in India but not only) where true religion, salvation, and conversion were at stake. Questions arose such as these: Are Krishna and Christ mythical or historical figures? The former mythical and the latter historical? Is either divine? Both? Did they truly come into this world, by incarnation or avatara? If they save, how does that happen -- and save from what? Are they moral role models? Can a Hindu love Christ, and a Christian love Krishna? Such were &#34;hot&#34; questions for a very long time, and even today for some. But for many, such questions have lost their urgency in the 21st century. It is good that competition is largely a thing of the past, but it may not be good that the urgency of the comparison -- Krishna and Christ, Christ or Krishna? -- no longer matters to most people. Do we have something to gain by taking both Krishna and Christ seriously? Facing this question sheds light on many larger questions regarding spirituality, religion, and cross-cultural learning.

        "course_description": "<p>This course provides students with the opportunity to explore how the study of pre-Hispanic and Colonial Mexican and Latinx cultures provide vital context for understanding today&#39;s changing world. The emphasis is on the mythical and social origins, glory days and political collapse of the Aztec Empire and Maya civilizations as a pivot to the study of the sexual, religious and racial interactions of the Great Encounter between Mesoamerica, Africa, Europe, and the independent nations of Mexico and the United States. The study of the archaeology, artistic media, cosmovision, capital cities, human sacrifice and the religious devotions of ancient Mesoamerica and the nature and impact of the devastating pandemic wrought by the arrival of European diseases in 1519 illuminate the Day of the Dead and Virgin of Guadalupe phenomena today. Special access to the photographic record of marvelous objects at the Peabody Museum aids in examining new concepts of race, nation and the persistence of Moctezuma&rsquo;s Mexico in Latinx identities in the Mexico-US Borderlands. One of the biggest student/museum events at Harvard is the Day of the Dead celebrations at the Peabody Museum, which provides the opportunity for students to work directly with the materiality of the longue duree of Mexico&#39;s storied history and evocative worldview. The museum collections and sections exercises provide the students with ways to integrate their classroom work to the objects and public program of the museum, plus experience community both locally and across cultural boundaries and physical borders. This course empowers our students to evaluate the ways the U.S. is changing and struggling to define itself in relation to Latin America and especially the migration of peoples, ideas, arts, music, food from and through Mexico now taking place during a new pandemic, 500 years after the first one that resulted from the Great Encounter.

It acknowledges the methodological difficulties involved in pursuing research on the phenomenon and practice of Islam across social contexts of the past and the present, while discussing possible methods of studying Islam as the religion lived by Muslims and even non-Muslims. Students will be introduced to academic and religious sources that encourage us to (re)approach Islam as the everyday experience of believers, the multiverse of rituals and exercises of knowledge acquisition, as well as contests over moral authority. Students will, moreover, be encouraged to consider if a focus on lived Islam encourages us to discard regnant dichotomies of &#39;textual&#39; and &#39;popular&#39; religion, along with imagined divisions of the Islamic world into a center and peripheries.

Did the Prophet Muhammad preach monotheism to a group of crude idolaters, or were his opponents already monotheists (if imperfect ones) who were also familiar with biblical ideas about God and history? Was Mecca an important center of Arabian pilgrimage and commerce before Islam, or was it a small town of local significance that grew in influence only after Islam? Did the followers of the Prophet and the residents of Arabia imagine themselves as sharing a common ethnic identity as \u201cArabs,\u201d or did they subscribe to a multiplicity of local tribal or geographical identities and developed a shared sense of being \u201cArab\u201d after they conquered the Near East? Did the early Muslims believe in the imminent end of the world or not? Was Islam originally an ecumenical monotheistic movement open to Jews and Christians, or did Islam\u2019s earliest adherents consider it a new and exclusive religion separate from Judaism and Christianity? Is the Qur\u2019anic text a record of Muhammad\u2019s own preaching or the result of a collective effort that continued after him (and perhaps had begun before him)? <br />This course is dedicated to an in-depth discussion of such fundamental historiographic questions.
