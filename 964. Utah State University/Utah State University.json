In particular, we will look at how media industries have worked to define and commodify this life stage, thereby creating expectations about what it means to \"grow up\" in western cultures. We will explore the importance of media texts - including music and fashion - in the construction of youth subcultures. Our investigation of subcultures will consider the role of race, class, and gender in academic theories about young people. We will examine how \"moral panics\" about youth culture and counter cultural movements are reflected and reproduced in current fears about the effects of media technologies and texts on teenagers. We will conclude by investigating how these various interventions play out in discussions about adolescents' media production, particularly in a digital environment in which young people are simultaneously constructed as savvy \"digital natives\" and vulnerable victims of media messages.

It asks students to consider foundational questions about what counts as an international crime; when an individual country may have jurisdiction over crimes that occur outside the country\u2019s boundaries and when and over what crimes an international body may have jurisdiction. It introduces students to the international criminal court; the special tribunals; domestic and international efforts to combat terrorism and an array of transnational crimes like drug trafficking, cybercrimes, white-collar crimes etc. This course cannot be taken for an S/U grade."

        "course_description": "It was Edwin Sutherland, an American sociologist of the early 20th century who first began to appreciate and understand white collar crime and distinguish it from other criminality. He was also the first to define it, calling it \"crime committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation\". Today, international white collar crime is a global phenomenon which reaches into the highest levels of transnational business and commercial behavior, government, and politics. It includes, but is not limited to, old fashioned graft and corruption, tax evasion, money laundering, securities and market manipulation, banking and insurance violations and fraud, influence peddling and even election fixing. This course is intended to provide the ICLJ\u2019s advanced students with a thorough understanding of what white collar crime is, where it is, how it is executed, what is being done to combat it, and what dangers it presents to established and emerging nations. The course will examine the approaches to these problems used in countries that have a strong interest dealing with white collar criminal issues. In addition, international best practices and standards will be critically assessed."

Course materials will include treaties, statutes, case law, historical essays, contemporary commentary and news articles, executive orders, and other works.  We will cover various themes including: competing international and domestic definitions of the crimes of terrorism and piracy; the law governing states\u2019 jurisdiction to prosecute such crimes; the nexus between terrorism and piracy and the laws of armed conflict\u2014such as that governing detention, trials, and targeted killing; as well as the law governing surveillance for counter-terrorism purposes and the anti-piracy efforts of non-state actors.

The majority are instead resolved in a domestic court system, meaning that, effectively, the practice of international criminal law occurs in a number of different criminal justice systems.  This course familiarizes students with the varieties of criminal justice systems around the world.  Though each country or region has its own individual system tailored to its history and culture, regional and cultural similarities exist in the structure and approach of individual systems.  The course will ground students in the major types of criminal justice systems around the world, from the Anglo-American system to a European system to an Islamic system.  The course will look both at individual systems from countries that have a strong presence in the world of international criminal law and at the general principles that underlie the differences in major systems."

The seminar will then be devoted to exploring advocacy efforts in the U.S. Congress and executive branch to date to hold traffickers accountable while providing assistance to victims of trafficking. \n\nIn particular, the seminar will look at: U.S. Congress\u2019 efforts to combat trafficking through the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, and executive branch action and federal appropriations funding to implement the Act. The class will also cover challenges to these efforts including inter-agency coordination, definitional issues and political and ideological cleavages within the broader anti-trafficking movement.\n\nThe seminar will also focus on the Department of State's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, the Department of Justice's efforts to prevent and prosecute human trafficking and protect the victims of trafficking, the Department of Labor's efforts to better document and deter trafficking and the Department of Health and Human Services efforts to provide services to victims of trafficking, especially children."

With good preparation, good class attendance and constructive participation, students will gain the following:  1. an intermediate technical understanding of cyberattacks; 2. knowledge of conduct that is prohibited under security and privacy laws; and 3.  an ability to critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of security laws and relevant case law.

Clients are then interviewed, necessary research is performed, and advice is given.  Students observe and provide feedback to each other using the same assessment forms that standardized clients will later use.  This familiarizes the students with what is later being tested and makes them more conscious of the skills necessary to interview a client successfully. Twice during the semester, students interview trained standardized clients who use a standardized fact pattern.  The standardized clients provide written and oral assessments of student interviewing skills based upon a standardized form. A satisfactory competency score for at least one of the interviews is required as a component of the DWS alternative bar exam.
