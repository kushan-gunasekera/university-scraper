With the SI model, a SI Leader (a student who has successfully completed the course with a B+ or better in the past, and who has an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher) is embedded into the course, attending all course meetings. The SI Leader then facilitates the scheduling and running of group SI study sessions throughout the week. There will typically be three one hour SI Sessions or two 90 minute SI Sessions per week. The SI Blackboard Platform is hosted by your SI Leader, who will utilize it to take confidential attendance at SI Sessions, to make general announcements to the class members, and to share helpful resources and study materials for SI Sessions. Participation in the SI study sessions is completely optional and always free, and you may come to as many or as few sessions as you would like over the semester. Your course professor does not receive any information about attendance, so you can be certain that your participation will be kept confidential."

SI is a well-researched program that has been shown to improve students' letter grades by a half to a full grade, with consistent participation. With the SI model, a SI Leader (a student who has successfully completed the course with a B+ or better in the past, and who has an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher) is embedded into the course, attending all course meetings. The SI Leader then facilitates the scheduling and running of group SI study sessions throughout the week. There will typically be three one hour SI Sessions or two 90 minute SI Sessions per week. The SI Blackboard Platform is hosted by your SI Leader, who will utilize it to take confidential attendance at SI Sessions, to make general announcements to the class members, and to share helpful resources and study materials for SI Sessions. Participation in the SI study sessions is completely optional and always free, and you may come to as many or as few sessions as you would like over the semester.

Students will furthermore come to understand contextual relevance and most importantly learn ways to approach research through guiding theory. In the end, it should become clear to students why ignoring the legacy of their intellectual ancestors would be a grave mistake; the great dinosaurs from the old schools of psychology are still able to teach us 'modern' psychologists plentiful."
