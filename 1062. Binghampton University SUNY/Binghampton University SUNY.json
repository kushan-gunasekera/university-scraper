Seminal theoretical works on the experience and aftereffects of psychological trauma, perpetrator/victim/survivor psychology and the politics of private and public memory will be studied and applied to three representative unresolved issues from the Asia Pacific War (1931-1945): the Nanjing Massacre, militarized sexual slavery (\u201ccomfort women\u201d) and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The nation-states of Asia took shape concurrently with other modern nations of the world and in response to similar and often interrelated historical circumstances. This seminar looks at the emergence of China, Japan, and Korea as modern nations in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries through such specific topics of comparative significance as \"the invention of tradition,\" the relationship between imperialism and the nation-state, multiple modernities, and the question of ethnic minorities within the nation. The seminar will examine varieties of nationalism that have emerged in East Asia since the late nineteenth century. It will discuss the ways in which historical actors defined, articulated and projected nationhood while negotiating cultural categories, such as Eastern/Western, traditional/modern and national/international. Particular attention is given to the interrelationship among imperialism, nationalism, and trans-nationality.",

The central aim of the course is to facilitate informed, critical thinking and nuanced understanding of modern and contemporary Asian experience by cultivating appreciation of the diverse ways individuals and collectives have undergone, remembered, responded to and represented their traumas, the factors affecting the extent to which they have been able to constitute, acknowledge, confront, worked through and articulate their violent pasts, and the implications of such (re)constructive efforts for personal/national identity, sociopolitical action and international relations. Seminal theoretical works on the experience and aftereffects of psychological trauma, perpetrator/victim/survivor psychology and the politics of private and public memory will be studied and applied to three representative unresolved issues from the Asia Pacific War (1931-1945): the Nanjing Massacre, militarized sexual slavery (\u201ccomfort women\u201d) and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Artistic representations of these controversial historical events and lived experiences will be analyzed to determine what novel insights they afford into the psychodynamics, costs in human terms and enduring consequences of ideological indoctrination, the psychological shift from \"sensory\" to \"mythic\" reality, objectification/dehumanization of the enemy/other, and mass violence and victimization. At the end of the semester, students will present to the class the results of their individualized research into the Nanjing Massacre, militarized sex slavery, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki or another clearly identified unresolved issue from modern wars in Asia (e.g., Korean War, Vietnam War).",

Most of the course will, however, focus on a study of modern African creative writing, through readings of published fiction, drama and poetry. By covering a wide range of genres and diverse geographical regions, the goal is for students to acquire a general understanding of the most important issues for African writers and artists, both historically and today. The course will also serve as an introduction to literary studies, and thus will focus on reading and writing skills, as well as basic techniques of literary analysis and academic communication.",

Arab-American women authors, in their turn, have not only addressed that same set of issues, but also highlighted their equally important, yet marginalized perspectives and experiences of difference and differentiation in the U.S. due to their gender. Furthermore, Arab-American authors who identify as Arab and Black, and whose origins are in Arab-African countries like Somalia, the Sudan, and Morocco present yet more complex expressions of identity and racial difference in their poetic and novelistic production. The course pays special attention to the diverse and complex literary articulations of what constitutes home, conflict, and identity in Arab-American literary works from the time of their emergence to the present. The course also explores the different approaches to cultural translation these authors undertake in order to create cultural understanding between their homeland and their adoptive country. In summary, we will identify the historical, ideological, and discursive conditions these Arab-American authors attempt to respond to in their works.

Based on a South-South comparison, students in this course explore the continued imprints of colonial encounters in Africa and Latin America in the political, social, economic, and cultural sphere of affected societies over the past century. To this end, the course introduces students to critical approaches to coloniality as well as insights from anthropology, history, and socio-political theory. After an introduction to theories of (de)-coloniality, we explore the manifold fallouts of colonization in comparative case studies of counter-insurgency warfare, subaltern refusals, epistemicide, archives, and gender relations from the early twentieth century to the present. By understanding the colonial nature of power relations from the local to the global, students will gain interdisciplinary analytical skills and develop comparative perspectives that allow them to interpret proliferating debates about legacies of colonialism and the need for restorative justice. The course will thereby equip students to critically reflect on past and current conjunctures of globalization from South-South perspectives.",

This seminar takes up the question of three-dimensional artworks produced by African Americans from the mid-19th century to the present, with a particular emphasis on what we could call \"Black monuments\" - works that occupy and demand attention in public space and discourse as a direct means of contesting a still-hegemonic White culture. From Edmonia Lewis creating memorials to emancipation in the mid-19th century to David Hammons, whose works draw on today's urban subcultures, we will examine a richly diverse range of sculpture, \"monuments\" to the indelible Black presence in shaping what American space might be.",

How do we use face-to-face interaction to establish harmony, maintain the bonds of social solidarity, and avoid or foster conflict?

For these reasons many biologists have accepted that we are in a new, human created epoch, the Anthropocene, characterized by a loss of biological diversity and complexity, while the geological community debates the criteria required for renaming.

Here are some questions at the heart of linguistics and artificial intelligence: What kind of a formal system natural language is? What makes it so unique and distinct from other kinds of communication systems? How can natural language vary? What are the limitations on what a natural language can look like, and most importantly, why do we find exactly the limitations that we find? This interdisciplinary course will examine the rapidly developing field of language- related AI. A unifying theme throughout the semester will be the possibility that the fields of linguistics and computer science might jointly contribute to advances in the study of both language and artificial intelligence, since machine learning is a powerful method over the past decade and its latest one is ChatGPT which has three main functions (Text generation, Language translation, and Text summarization). This class will introduce you to some key findings that target these questions in different area of linguistics and artificial intelligence. We will discuss what are the building blocks that language employ to build sentences (syntax), how natural languages externalize the structures that are built (phonetics and phonology) and assign them meanings in different contexts (semantics). In linguistics, we will also talk about how languages are acquired (language acquisition). In language-related AI, we will discuss Natural language processing (NLP), Machine translation, Speech recognition, Semantic analysis, and Computational linguistics. For each week, everyone is required to complete the assigned readings specified in the syllabus and is encouraged to read the related literature if possible. Each of you is strongly recommended to further investigate the issues before the class meetings and reach your own conclusions concerning the adequacy of the analyses presented in the books.

To this end, the course introduces students to critical approaches to coloniality as well as insights from anthropology, history, and socio-political theory. After an introduction to theories of (de)-coloniality, we explore the manifold fallouts of colonization in comparative case studies of counter-insurgency warfare, subaltern refusals, epistemicide, archives, and gender relations from the early twentieth century to the present. By understanding the colonial nature of power relations from the local to the global, students will gain interdisciplinary analytical skills and develop comparative perspectives that allow them to interpret proliferating debates about legacies of colonialism and the need for restorative justice.

The course will also examine ethical issues and controversies surrounding genetic research and applications, such as genetic testing, genetic counseling, gene editing, and genetic laboratory methods, such as next-generation sequencing, computational workflows, and phylogenetic analysis using ancient and modern genomic data sets. We will also explore how these results can integrate with other sources of evidence, such as archaeological and linguistic data, to reconstruct the population history of our ancestors. Throughout the course, students will engage in critical analysis of genetic data, develop skills in genetic/genomic analysis, data visualization and interpretation, and scientific writing. By the end of the course students will have a comprehensive understanding of the role of genetics in anthropology and be able to critically evaluate the social and ethical implications of anthropological genetics research.",
