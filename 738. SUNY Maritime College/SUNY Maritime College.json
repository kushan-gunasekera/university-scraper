The course is founded in cultural anthropology and combines discussions of climate fictions and climate science to think through the future. We learn from diverse cultures and perspectives, and integrate a cross-cultural comparison to our own cultures, and study how certain groups respond to climate change and related management decisions. Students focus on understanding how we as humans envision the world, our place in it, and what we desire for our futures influence how we know and treat the world now, as well as how we react to various possible social and environmental transformations. We apply an anthropological lens to assess diverse ways of imagining the future, understand how various cultures inform social-environmental programs and policies, and interpret the equity and justice implications of climate decisions for society."

This course surveys the broad literature on \u201casylum\u201d to examine how our bordered world came to be, and how those at humanity\u2019s edges seek and often fail to find asylum. How did the political right of asylum develop historically and what explains its demise today? What remains of \u201cthe human\u201d when people no longer have \u201ca right to have rights\u201d? What does a world where the stateless are systematically persecuted do to our common humanity? Addressing these difficult ethical and political questions, this course asks us to consider how we are all inevitably entangled in complex formations of violence at a global scale, and what a different, more equal, and less violent world might look like."

At the end of the course we will reflect on how these seemingly disparate aspects of life can be unified into a coherent framework for human flourishing.

Even with a properly functioning immune system, it is difficult to consistently maintain health without the physician's arsenal of anti-microbial therapies.  You will learn about the ontogeny and normal functions of the immune system and, as with any bodily system, its dysfunctions.  Drug therapies cannot be discussed without the underpinning principles of pharmacology.  You will learn how drugs act on their target receptors, how drugs are absorbed and metabolized once administered to a patient, and how factors such as diet, age or disease can affect drug action. The autonomic nervous system is vital to the control of all internal organs and the vasculature and is affected, directly and indirectly, by a wide range of therapeutics. You will learn how drugs interact with the autonomic nervous system and the therapeutic uses of these drugs, as well as predict their adverse effects. Returning to the immune system and its role in antimicrobial defenses, we will introduce you to classes of microbes and their surprising contributions to human health.  We will discuss microbial characteristics that facilitate disease causation and that also offer therapeutic opportunities.  Then, of course, those therapies will be covered (bugs and drugs).  Lastly, after a brief introduction to cancer pathology, we will discuss cancer immunology, immunotherapy and chemotherapy. You will find small group computerized cases, a Sim lab experience, problem-solving opportunities and numerous clinical correlations to stimulate and deepen learning, allowing you to explore how information conveyed in class applies to the practice of medicine.  We hope you enjoy the course."

        "course_description": "The purpose of the health care ethics course for first year medical students is threefold. First, this foundational course is the first in a longitudinal approach to ethics instruction designed to teach students that ethics is not merely a set of rules nor an ancillary part of the medical curriculum that can be set aside when the ethics course is over. Rather, ethics is a central part of medical practice, including how one understands the goals and ends of medicine, how one sees a patient, how one interviews a patient, what are the ethical norms that govern the practice of medicine, and how to work through a clinical ethics dilemma. Second, the core ethics sessions instruct students the practical ethical standards (and some legal standards as well) that govern the practice of medicine. Emphasis will be placed on covering standards that are well entrenched and supported by wide consensus in the medical community. These standards are basic aspects of medical practice, reflecting values that each physician is expected (by colleagues, patients, legal authorities, and others) to uphold. However, certain realms of medical practice currently exhibit high levels of ethical controversy and flux. These more controversial areas may be visited in discussion, but emphasis will be placed on delineating the current scope of established ethical and legal norms. Third, the course will introduce a basic ethical framework for evaluating clinical cases. This framework will be applied in lecture and case discussion sessions."

The course is longitudinal and integrated into the other courses of the second year. The purpose of this design is to avoid allowing students to think of ethics as something external to clinical practice.  Rather, ethical practice lies at the heart of medicine, and students must learn to think of themselves as moral agents even as they learn how to diagnose and treat patients."

Complicating fraught relations between Christians, Jews and Muslims, they helped lead to the bloodshed of the Peasants' War, the Schmalkaldic Wars, the Thirty Years War and the English Civil Wars.

Under these circumstances, nation after nation turned to outsiders with bearing extremist agendas and promising the restoration of lost national grandeur. Who bore responsibility for the decisions to enter into both World Wars? Who bore responsibility for the collapse of liberal regimes? Were some nations more culpable than others? ."

The second half of the course examines challenges to the postwar European order - destalinization, student protests, economic stagnation, neo-conservatism, radical Islam, populism and renewed authoritarianism."

Fundamental antitrust principles covered include monopolization, mergers and acquisitions, cartels and professionalism, joint ventures, price-fixing, exclusionary conduct, and private versus public enforcement. This course then explores the major applications of antitrust laws in health care contexts, examining how competition policy interacts with health care costs and shapes business practices in the markets for medical services, medical products, and insurance for both.

Finally, students will assess case studies where failure to appreciate culture has had critical consequences."

It is designed to enhance fourth year medical students\u2019 Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) information skills for the effective evidence-based clinical practice. The main purpose of the course is to increase students\u2019 familiarity with the practice of EBM by solidifying students\u2019 EBM competency as they refine their EBM literature searching skills and determine the validity of a clinical research and its applicability to their clinical practice and clinical decisions.   The coursework starts with pre-course assignments (a test and EBM practice assignment), followed by in-depth readings on topics in advanced EBM, hierarchy of evidence levels and types of study, and literature research applied to EBM. A set of a test and a variety of exercises follow. Emphases will be given to effective EBM literature search techniques to locate the best information focused to answer a clinical question.   The EBM information skills acquired through this course will help students to meet one of the 13 Entrustable Professional Activities (EPA) outlined in the AAMC Report published on May 2014. Specifically, students will be better equipped to meet the 7th of the Core Entrustable Professional Activities for Entering Residency. A solid foundation of the EBM information skills will also help students as a housestaff resident to meet the core competencies required by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME).

Either of these tasks is daunting: Acquiring a new language involves not just vocabulary and grammar but context and culture. Where do I use this language? What does it mean to speak these words with authority? How am I perceived when I use these words? Meanwhile, students are taking on the mantle of doctor and trying to figure out how they will be recognized in the world. Will this affect my relationships? Will it set me apart, or above, my patients, my friends, my family? How will I be perceived as a physician? These intellectual and affective challenges are remarkably like those faced by actors taking on a challenging role. The actor has to learn a script, understand its meaning, and appreciate how he or she will be perceived. They need to be aware of how they present themselves, not just to fellow actors, but to the wider public of paying audiences and critics. Actors also learn the crucial task of how to let go of a role once the play is over. Through readings, films, and interactive class exercises, Dr. Haller and Fr. Seibert will use techniques well known to actors to help prepare medical students for their role as doctors. Students will examine how physicians are viewed in popular culture, and they will be challenged to consider how they will create their persona as physicians. They will also be invited to explore techniques for how actors step out of roles when appropriate."

Students will not be allowed to write or sign orders.  Students will take call on a schedule to average one night in four.  Students are encouraged to utilize call for educational experience and therefore may elect to modify their call schedule and remain \"on call\" on nights when activity in the PICU is particularly challenging.  Note:  Attending physicians are responsible for the care of critically-ill children.  They are present in the PICU or immediately available 24 hours per day.  Students and resident physicians participate in the care of patients at a level of responsibility individualized for particular patients and students/residents.  Attending physicians are responsible for critical decision, evaluations and procedures.  The M4 student will be assigned 1-2 patients per week, maintaining responsibility (with the attending and resident physicians) for 1-3 patients.  The M4 will work closely with the assigned resident physician in the evaluation, management, and documentation of each patient's course.  Patient selection will be targeted for common and representative ICU problems.  Observation and understanding (not performance) of critical care procedures are appropriate goals.  All members of the PICU Critical Care Service, including the M4, must be familiar with all patients in the PICU.  All patients, therefore, serve as educational experience for the M4 who is considered intellectually involved and responsible for aspects of their care."

        "course_description": "In 1987 the World Commission on Environment and Development (aka the Bruntland Commission) was convened to address the growing concerns about environmental degradation in light of escalating human development.  From that came the call to switch the world policy focus toward a more sustainable future.  Sustainable development is most commonly defined as meeting the needs of our present generation while taking the needs of the future generation into consideration.  The concept appears simply.  Yet, the challenge lies in how we get there.  What does it mean to meet the needs of our present generation?  How do we define those needs?  And what does it mean to take the needs of a future generation into consideration at the same time?  What does all of that look like?  Therein lies the policy challenge.  As we enter the second decade of the 21st century, the world looks vastly different from the time when these conversations about sustainable development began.  Even within the past year, the policy frame has changed dramatically, suggesting that there is room for expanding the sustainable development discourse.  In this course we explore those questions at the global, national, and local scale."

This course will provide doctoral students with the appropriate training on how to collect their own data in responding to a research question that they developed in PHS 6050: Science, Theory and Public Health. The purpose of this course is to provide an opportunity for doctoral students to begin to answer a previously determined research question by selecting an appropriate research design, and implement a data collection protocol.  As a result, students will gain experience in primary data collection methods.  The focus in this class will be the implementation of a data collection protocol that addresses multiple components of the ecological framework.   (Offered every Spring)"

In addition, students will have the opportunity to shadow the various physicians involved in the care of the patient to learn the medicine behind treating a patient with cancer.  As cancer becomes more prevalent, it is imperative that medical students should learn not only how to treat patients with cancer, but also the impact it imparts on the patient physically, mentally, and emotionally. This elective was created to afford students the opportunity to learn about this chronic disease beyond the scope of modern medicine. This knowledge will ultimately equip medical students with the empathy and compassion to successfully treat an individual with cancer. It is our hope that cancer will serve as a model for all chronic diseases and lessons gained from this elective will influence the students' approach to any type of chronic care and management."

On days 3-5, students will spend time demonstrating proficiency in using interrupted and running stitches on small sheets of latex under the operating microscope, while using 8-0 materials.  Following documented proficiency with this section, they will then move to dissecting turkey wing arteries and veins under an operating microscope.   After severing these vessels, the students anastomose them (end to end or end to side) with 8-0 stitches. Both interrupted and running stitches will once again be used.  Once the anastomosis is completed, patency will be checked by infusing the vessels with water through a 3-cc syringe with a 27-gauge needle.  Proficiency will have to be demonstrated in each activity by the student before they progress to the next sequential step in the tutorial.  Streaming videos of some of these techniques are currently available and students can watch these before beginning the elective.  A written tutorial guide is also included."

Should civil, social, and political rights, which are contingent upon citizenship status, be universal rights, or group-differentiated rights? How should we expand/amend conventional definitions of citizenship and political participation to account for the lived experiences of women, people of color, and people with disabilities? How do social constructed and maintained inequalities- via sexism, racism, and ableism- influence the practice of citizenship? Overall, this course will attempt to integrate the insights from feminist theory, critical race theory, and disability studies into an analysis of what it means to be an American citizen."
