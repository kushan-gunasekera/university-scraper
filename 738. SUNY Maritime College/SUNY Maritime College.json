If students are to become not only researchers themselves, but also good consumers of others\u2019 research, the fundamentals of scientific inquiry must be understood. This means identifying problems that are appropriately addressed by research, selecting the most appropriate research design for the particular problem, and understanding the best sampling techniques and measures for the problem. By understanding these foundations, students can assess the validity of others\u2019 research, and therefore, the strength of evidence for management and policy decisions. This course does not cover in-depth data analysis."

Even with a properly functioning immune system, it is difficult to consistently maintain health without the physician's arsenal of anti-microbial therapies.  You will learn about the ontogeny and normal functions of the immune system and, as with any bodily system, its dysfunctions.  Drug therapies cannot be discussed without the underpinning principles of pharmacology.  You will learn how drugs act on their target receptors, how drugs are absorbed and metabolized once administered to a patient, and how factors such as diet, age or disease can affect drug action. The autonomic nervous system is vital to the control of all internal organs and the vasculature and is affected, directly and indirectly, by a wide range of therapeutics. You will learn how drugs interact with the autonomic nervous system and the therapeutic uses of these drugs, as well as predict their adverse effects. Returning to the immune system and its role in antimicrobial defenses, we will introduce you to classes of microbes and their surprising contributions to human health.  We will discuss microbial characteristics that facilitate disease causation and that also offer therapeutic opportunities.  Then, of course, those therapies will be covered (bugs and drugs).  Lastly, after a brief introduction to cancer pathology, we will discuss cancer immunology, immunotherapy and chemotherapy. You will find small group computerized cases, a Sim lab experience, problem-solving opportunities and numerous clinical correlations to stimulate and deepen learning, allowing you to explore how information conveyed in class applies to the practice of medicine.  We hope you enjoy the course."

Educators first implement strategies for promoting active engagement and countering disproportionality in discipline through universal design and inclusive and trauma-informed classroom practices. Educators then implement research-based strategies to provide additional behavioral and social-emotional support to learners that require additional intervention. Educators also more deeply consider how to leverage assistive technology tools to support learner independence and provide equitable access to learning opportunities."

It is designed to enhance fourth year medical students\u2019 Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) information skills for the effective evidence-based clinical practice. The main purpose of the course is to increase students\u2019 familiarity with the practice of EBM by solidifying students\u2019 EBM competency as they refine their EBM literature searching skills and determine the validity of a clinical research and its applicability to their clinical practice and clinical decisions.   The coursework starts with pre-course assignments (a test and EBM practice assignment), followed by in-depth readings on topics in advanced EBM, hierarchy of evidence levels and types of study, and literature research applied to EBM. A set of a test and a variety of exercises follow. Emphases will be given to effective EBM literature search techniques to locate the best information focused to answer a clinical question.   The EBM information skills acquired through this course will help students to meet one of the 13 Entrustable Professional Activities (EPA) outlined in the AAMC Report published on May 2014. Specifically, students will be better equipped to meet the 7th of the Core Entrustable Professional Activities for Entering Residency. A solid foundation of the EBM information skills will also help students as a housestaff resident to meet the core competencies required by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME).  Students\u2019 SLU email (@slu.edu) is the way used for communication, including Blackboard announcements and emails. Students registered to the course are expected to regularly check their emails."
