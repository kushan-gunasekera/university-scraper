A\nliberal arts education enshrines the question.\nQuestions are the catalyst for and the evidence of\na liberal arts mind. Therefore, this class engages\nstudents in the exploration of fundamental\nquestions of humanity from multiple perspectives.\nThe daily activity of the class most often\ninvolves discussion, wherein students and faculty\nconsider together classic and contemporary works\nfrom multiple disciplines, including a variety of\ngenres in literature and art, essays, drama,\nmusic, film, and new media. Although individual\nsections will vary in terms of specific\ninstructional activities and assignments, the\ngoals of EQ are: (1) to facilitate the development\nof fundamental intellectual skills of careful\nreading, considerate thought, and effective\nwritten and oral communication, (2) to encourage\nstudents to consider and communicate with one\nanother about ideas that matter and (3) to build\nrelationships among students, staff, and faculty.\nIn addition to regular class sessions, students\nare expected to attend affiliated speakers and\nprograms both on and off-campus.\nSince 2016-17, fall Freshman Tutorial sections\n(comprised of 15-16 students) continue together in\nthe spring for EQ; however, instructors typically\nchange.

The course then moves to\nPlato's Gorgias and Phaedrus and the\ndisciplinizing\" efforts of Aristotle. Finally,\nthe course examines the efforts of Cicero and\nQuintilian to reunite philosophy and rhetoric and\ninclude ethics within the realm of rhetoric.\nStudents learn how rhetorical theories are\ngenerated out of the specific needs of political\nand social contexts. Finally, students trace the\nrelationship between rhetoric and philosophy from\npre-Platonic unity, through Plato's bifurcation,\nand finally to the attempts at reunification by\nAristotle, Cicero, and Quintilian. This course\nshould be taken in the junior or sophomore years.\nThis course is typically offered in the spring\nsemester. "
