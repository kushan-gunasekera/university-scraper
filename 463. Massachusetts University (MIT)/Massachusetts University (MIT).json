        "course_description": "Explores how studies of human vision can be motivated by, and enhance the capabilities of, machine-based systems. Considers the twin questions of how the performance of state-of-the-art machine vision systems compares with that of humans, and what kinds of strategies the human visual system uses in tasks where human performance exceeds that of machines. Includes presentations by engineers from companies with significant engineering efforts in vision. Based on these presentations, students define and conduct studies to address the two aforementioned questions and present their results to the public at the end of the term. Directed towards students interested in exploring vision from computational, experimental and practical perspectives. Provides instruction and practice in written and oral communication.",
