The course introduces numeric, string, and list data, functions, decisions, recursion, iteration, and object- orientation. Applications include matrix operations, image manipulation, games, rules-based and generative artificial intelligence, and searching. Learning to program is a skill that can only be learned through practice -- it cannot be acquired from merely watching a series of lectures. Rather, students will learn through a combination of short readings; mini-lecture videos; interactive examples; and complex problem sets. Students must actively engage with these examples and problem sets to develop both the muscle memory of programming as well as a mental model of how programs execute and interact with data. Students will learn new concepts independently and attend regular workshop sessions to develop debugging skills and to obtain assistance with problem sets. The structure of the online class demands that students be intrinsically motivated to acquire programming skills, so that they will be motivated to keep up with a demanding schedule of learning activities and problem sets. To be successful in this course, students must be prepared to dedicate approximately 25-30 hours per week to the learning objectives.

At the same time this food is wasted, food insecurity is everywhere, even on BU's campus. Is all wasted food \"trash?\" Need it be? Why is food wasted and where along the supply chain is it wasted? What are the ethics of donating surplus food/waste/trash of those who have too much to those who don't have enough? This hybrid course explores the history, culture, rhetoric, and practicalities of wasted food, from farm, through fork, to gut (is overeating a form of food waste? What about wasting micronutrients by converting them to ultraprocessed foods?).

        "course_description": "The Social Work Practice with Groups course is grounded in the core values and  ethics of the social work profession. Central to all components of course is the  utilization of a strengths-perspective, commitment to anti-oppressive practice,  and the application of a racial and social justice lens. This course teaches the social work practice skills needed at various stages of  the helping process (i.e., engagement, assessment, goal setting and treatment  planning, intervention and termination). This includes what the social worker  purposefully does as they work with clients and how the social worker reacts and  interacts in the helping relationship. The helping relationship is based on  positive regard for the full range of human diversity, and dedication to social  and economic justice.  While the course emphasizes ways that social workers can help clients/consumers  accomplish goals, it also highlights the value of the helping relationship as a  vehicle for client growth. Because a major hallmark of effective social work  practice is the ability to reflect on one's interactions with individuals and  larger client systems, this course highlights the need to develop the capacity  for professional self-reflection (i.e., the ability to observe and critique  one's actions in relation to clients, supervisors, and colleagues and the  integration of personal and professional \"selves\").   Students acquire knowledge of group stages (from formation through termination),  group types (task-oriented, psycho-educational, support and therapy) and group  structure (single-session, time-limited, open versus closed groups). They also  develop skills for forming and leading groups. The Mutual-Aid Model provides the  central organizing framework, showing the worker (a) how to mediate between and  among three domains-- individual member, the group-as-a- whole, and the  environment, (b) how to respond to dynamics such as transference,  countertransference, and issues of power and control, and (c) how to promote  client and group empowerment. Incorporating knowledge and skills in social work  theory and group practice, students learn how to use themselves effectively with  diverse populations, in various community and clinical settings, and with  differing member problems and concerns.  Social and environmental stressors on  group members and the group-as-a-whole are considered at all stages of group  development and with a variety of group types. Since social workers must have  the capacity to assume varying roles in groups, students learn to shift the  nature of their participation depending on the situation, for example, to be a  colleague in an interdisciplinary team of care providers, to be the leader of a  neighborhood task force, and to be a clinician providing psycho-educational  services to the parents of children struggling to thrive.  The greatest  opportunity for skill development in this course occurs when students take  initiative to organize, facilitate, or co-facilitate groups in their field  placement, and all are encouraged to do so if this is possible within the nature  of the placement.     \n[  3 cr.]"

Principles, values, and goals of each model are compared, contrasted, and  critically examined in their approaches to assessment, service planning,  intervention, termination, and evaluation. Students analyze how each model  addresses worker-client interactions in the therapeutic relationship and are  encouraged to view the clinical relationship as a microcosm of the client's  functioning that reflects social and structural factors. The worker-client  relationship is also viewed within an interpersonal context where clients may  gain insights about themselves, and as an opportunity for change, empowerment,  and advocacy. The course emphasizes the critical importance of research evidence  in the selection and implementation of approaches to inform clinical practice  with individuals.  This course integrates an anti-oppressive framework that  describes the effects of systemic oppression on people and systems, including  the potential influence in the worker-client relationship, the agency, and the  interdisciplinary team context.\n[  3 cr.]"

Skill practice and exercises will illustrate (a) individual versus systemic thinking, and (b) the meaning or context of the symptom within the larger system. An important outcome is that students will be able to facilitate communication among family members. \n \nStudents will learn family systems concepts and theories that are foundational to the practice of family assessment and intervention. A conceptual framework, Liberation Health, will Major be used to assist students in understanding families within the larger socio-political-cultural context. Students will also learn Structural Family Therapy and Narrative Family Therapy as an exemplars of a family systems intervention. \n \nAs part of this work, students will deepen their ability to build alliances with the family as a whole, assess families using common family assessment tools, and develop hypotheses about the family\u2019s experiences, structures, ideologies, and internal dynamics that may have affected the presenting problem.

Introduces  students to social work practice in healthcare settings from a biopsychosocial  perspective. The primary objective is for students to gain the knowledge and  clinical skills necessary to intervene effectively in medical settings and to  work with clients experiencing serious health problems. Individual classes  address skill development across central practice themes including the  subjective experience of and reactions to living with illness, social work  values and ethical dilemmas in health care, and communicating with patients and  families living with serious illness. The course also examines differences in  the social work role across settings including inpatient, outpatient clinics,  and home hospice and introduces students to the emerging sub-specialties in  medical social work (i.e., transplant, oncology, palliative care). Students gain  a deeper understanding of the shifting role of social work in the  interdisciplinary world of health care practice and become knowledgeable of the  roles and underlying theoretical models used by behavioral health providers  working in integrated health settings (using the medical homes model). The  impact of structural factors (i.e., racism, sexism, ableism, etc.) on a  patient's experience with the healthcare system is addressed as we examine how  cultural beliefs around health, healing, and illness impact the clinical  relationship and the service delivery system. \n[  3 cr.]"

The course begins with a discussion of CBT, social work values,   and social justice mission, and considers the strengths and limitations of CBT   in the implementation of inclusive, affirming, anti-racist practice. The   introduction also includes an overview of theoretical frameworks that underlie   CBT, including cognitive models based mainly on A. T. Beck's theories as well as   behavioral theory. The course incorporates Third Wave CBT therapies and forms of   CBT including mindfulness based therapies as well as complementary approaches   such as motivational interviewing. Cognitive/behavioral analysis (also called   case formulation) and assessment of specific challenges as well as strengths,   are taught using students' current practice experiences with children and   adults. Several intervention methods are illustrated using client examples,   video, demonstration and role-play where possible. These include developing a   case conceptualization, cognitive restructuring, behavioral experiments, and   exposure therapy (desensitization for treatment of anxiety). Discussions will   include the application of CBT methods with consideration of structural factors,   experiences of marginalization and oppression, the client/therapist   relationship, the use of CBT methods in group settings, and ethical issues. For   the major assignments, students complete two related paper and video   assignments: (1) a cognitive and/or behavioral analysis and assessment of a   current client in the student's field placement or work setting and (2) a review   of the literature and application of relevant cognitive and/or behavioral   intervention(s) related to this client. Two additional credit/no credit   assignments involve identifying, assessing, analyzing and intervening with a   personal habit or challenge that can be discussed in class.

Required of all students.\nHuman Behavior in the Social Environment (HBSE) is designed to help you chart a  knowledgeable course through the complexity of human experience. We will explore  a select set of theories that help us understand how individuals and communities  develop and interact. Because empathic and skillful interventions with  individuals, groups, and communities require understanding ourselves as well as  others, the course provides an opportunity for increased self-awareness. At the  beginning of the course, we focus on the key theories that help us understand  the dimensions and expression of human behavior in the social environment. This  discussion is followed by an examination of how dimensions of culture and  cultural contexts can shape individuals values, beliefs, worldviews, and  identities, all of which play a role in the helping process. Through discussion  and analysis, we will explore areas of universality and difference in the  context of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, spiritual beliefs, and  socioeconomic class, as well as the realities and influence of multiple forms of  oppression. Finally, we will examine human development throughout the lifespan,  considering the developmental scientific knowledge base regarding opportunities  and vulnerabilities during the different stages of the lifecycle, and the  biopsychosocial and cultural factors that can influence individual development.   HB 720 constitutes the foundation course in the human behavior department and is  the underpinning of all courses in the HBSE sequence. The ability to analyze  human behavior in the social environment, drawing from theoretically and  empirically-grounded evidence bases, is essential for social work practice,  whether the primary focus is clinical or macro. Social work has a distinct  perspective that emphasizes the interconnection between individuals and their  environments. The framework draws from other disciplines, including  anthropology, economics, psychology, biology, and sociology. The course will  provide an understanding of the interactions among biological, social, and  psychological, and cultural systems. Forces that facilitate optimal growth and  development will be contrasted with forces that impede development. The course  will build on your undergraduate knowledge of basic human behavior theories,  adding theoretical breadth, critical contextualization, and professional  application.   \n[  3 cr.]"

Discussions and course work will also include hidden disabilities and embodied vulnerability that everyone experiences. This broad focus on disability establishes its relevance and connection to all of us. First, we will focus on the academy and on how to be a theologian and leader who focuses on disability. In this course, we turn our attention to the practice of doing theology as a liberatory praxis to develop an understanding of how disability operates in our culture, and to build practical wisdom and leadership skills to combat ableism. The aim of this course is to help students develop transformative proposals for the church and society. In this exploration, we will pay careful attention to the central themes of disability, namely embodiment and marginalization.\n[4 cr.]"

And why?  In this course, we will investigate both the whats and whys of productions like this wacky version of Daphnis: choreographers who entirely reimagine canonical ballets such as Swan Lake, Giselle, Sleeping Beauty, and The Rite of Spring among others.  To that end, we work to understand the political as well as the aesthetic implications of these remade productions.  Said another way, this course rethinks what ballet (with its musical as well as its danced components) can--and perhaps should--do. \n[  3 cr.]"

It involves narrative distortions, weird photographic, editorial, and acoustic effects, strange events, and eccentric characters--all in the service of attempting to alter our definition of \"reality.\" We will look at some of the most bizarre movies ever made, along with a few apparently (but only apparently) \"normal\" films that have more insidious designs on our consciousnesses, that aspire to change our understandings of experience in subtler ways. No pre-requisites and no permission required. (this course fulfills the foreign cinema requirement)\n[  4 cr.]"

Securitization involves the creation and issuance of notes or other  forms of securities backed by one or more assets which generate cash flows  sufficient to fund the timely payment of the principal and interest due on the  securities. The securities are also usually issued by special-purpose  bankruptcy-remote vehicles to insulate the assets from the risk of bankruptcy.  This feature, combined with cash reserve accounts, overcollateralization and  other features, achieves the \"alchemy\" of converting unrated assets into  investment grade securities. These transactions often cut across many areas of  legal specialization, including bank regulation, securities regulation,  taxation, bankruptcy, and real estate and corporate law.  In addition to  teaching the elements of these various legal disciplines that are applied to  securitization transactions, this course is unique among securitization courses  offered at other law schools in the U.S. in that it involves the students in a  series of real or hypothetical case studies that require the application of  these legal disciplines to the process of structuring actual securitization  transactions. In addition to residential and commercial mortgage-backed  securities and trade receivable securitizations,  this course also explores some  of the more cutting-edge securitizations of more esoteric asset classes,  including legal fees, patents, trademarks and copyrights, as well as  securitization of whole businesses.

        "course_description": "In the mid-1980s, a scholarly movement to become known as \"Critical Race Theory\" (CRT) developed in legal academia. Early critical race theorists--including Derrick Bell, Mari Matsuda, Charles Lawrence, Richard Delgado, Kimberle Crenshaw, and Patricia Williams--challenged the substance and style of conventional legal scholarship. Substantively, race crits rejected formal equality, individual rights, and colorblind approaches to solving legal problems. Stylistically, critical race scholars often employed new methodologies for legal scholarship, including storytelling and narrative. The Critical  Race Theory Colloquium is designed to expose students to core CRT principles and interrogate CRT's possibilities and limitations. This endeavor will require students to think critically about race and racism in conjunction with other intersecting structures of oppression and hierarchy. The Critical Race Theory Colloquium employs a workshop-format that enables students to engage leading scholars in the field of Critical Race  Theory. The first part of the semester will involve a general overview of Critical Race Theory. During the remaining meetings, invited scholars will present works-in-progress for discussion. To prepare, students will write short reaction papers that include three questions for further discussion. Final grades depend on the reaction papers, class participation, and attendance.

The goals of this workshop are three: for students to deepen their substantive knowledge of IP law, for students to increase their abilities to participate in scholarly debate, and for established scholars to improve their working papers through the input of the workshop group. COREQUISITE/PREREQUISITE: Ideally, students should have taken or be concurrently enrolled in a course in IP, Copyright, Patent, or Trademark. Students who have not taken such a course (or who are not enrolled currently in such a course) must obtain the permission of the instructor. Students in the seminar will write several short papers commenting on the papers presented in the workshop. UPPER-CLASS WRITING REQUIREMENT: This class may not be used to satisfy the requirement.  ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.

        "course_description": "Practice Areas: General Business, Banking/Finance, Corporate Governance and Restructuring  This course is one of the semester-long transaction simulations offered as part of the Transactional Law Program. The simulated transaction is the structuring, negotiation and documentation, and subsequent restructuring of a $1.7 billion secured, syndicated commercial loan to a large, privately held medical testing company (the \"Company\"). The Company's primary purpose for seeking this loan is to use the proceeds to pay an extraordinary dividend to its founder and controlling shareholder and to several private equity firms which own stock in the Company (often referred to as a \"dividend recap loan\"). The course will explore some of the key issues, and students will perform several of the principal tasks, which transactional lawyers specializing in general business, banking/finance, corporate governance and/or restructuring must consider and carry out in advising corporate clients and financial institutions in a transaction of this kind. These tasks will include advising the Company's board of directors and officers or prospective lenders in evaluating whether to engage in the dividend recap loan transaction, the steps needed to obtain corporate approval of such transaction given that certain board members who are also shareholders will benefit from it, and structuring, negotiating and documenting these types of transactions. The course will also examine the critical role certain provisions of the credit and security agreements for the loan play following the loan closing when serious problems and potential events of default arise leading to a restructuring of the original loan. Finally, the course will consider various ways a troubled loan can be restructured either through an out-of-court consensual transaction or a Chapter 11 restructuring. The course grade will be based on class participation and graded drafting assignments. CLASS SIZE: Limited to 12 students. PREREQUISITE OR CO-REQUISITE: Corporations.

This course builds on first-year courses in Constitutional Law and Civil Procedure and complements upperclass courses on modern public law and legal institutions: e.g., Administrative Law, Immigration Law, Environmental Law, Labor Law, and Conflict of Laws. Topics include the separation of federal legislative and judicial powers, Congress' authority to prescribe the federal courts' jurisdiction and to assign adjudicatory duties to other bodies (e.g., \"legislative\" courts and agencies), standing to litigate in federal court, conflicts between federal and state courts, the states' immunity from private lawsuits, the Supreme Court's authority to review state court judgments, and \"abstention\" doctrines governing the exercise of federal judicial power.  We will explore theoretical and policy questions--asking not only what federal-courts law is at the moment, but also what it should be.  Yet we will organize our discussions around practical lawyering in the federal courts--identifying and analyzing the constitutional, statutory, and judge-made hurdles that litigants must clear to obtain a decision on the merits of a federal question.  Especially recommended for students who plan to practice with firms that represent clients subject to federal regulation, to pursue careers with federal or state agencies and departments, or to handle constitutional, civil rights, or other public interest litigation.\n[  4 cr.]"

        "course_description": "The antitrust laws reflect a conviction that competition in the marketplace will yield the best outcomes for consumers and the optimal allocation of resources in our economy. Beginning with the Sherman Act of 1890, the antitrust statutes condemn a variety of acts -- from mergers to agreements among competitors to monopolists' exclusionary business practices -- that restrain trade or contribute to monopoly power. The statutes, however, are written in general terms, leaving it to the courts to draw the line between lawful competition and unlawful restraints of trade or monopolization. Early on, the Supreme Court established that the law reaches only \"unreasonable\" restraints, which only begs the question of how to draw the line between \"reasonable\" competition and \"unreasonable\" interference with competitive markets. Over the course of the twentieth  century, the courts struggled to fix this line; as the century closed, they had settled on an economically-oriented normative framework that largely deferred to firm decisions and doubted the value of government intervention in markets. In recent years, however, a cacophony of voices -- ranging from activists to scholars to politicians of all stripes -- has begun to call that framework into question and to call for renewed enforcement of antitrust laws.    This course will explore the principal statutes and common law that have shaped antitrust law over the past century-and-a-quarter since Congress passed the Sherman Act. We will also examine the standards and procedures that the antitrust agencies use to evaluate mergers and to challenge conduct as anticompetitive. As we critically evaluate the case law, we will also reflect on current calls for reform. While we will engage rigorously with economics, all of the economic principles necessary to understand the case law and debates will be explained in the course; formal training in economics is not a requirement. \n[  4 cr.]"

These choices result in a legal regime that, at once, is enormously complex, implicates the most basic questions of equity and constitutional freedoms, and affects people in every aspect of their daily  lives. This course will examine land use from a legal, historical, theoretical, and, most important, practical perspective. Students will be introduced to a brief history of land use controls in the United States. The course will then cover the basic aspects of land use law: Euclidean zoning, special use permits, variances, vested rights and preexisting uses, exactions, exclusionary and inclusionary zoning, subdivision control, wetlands control, and legal challenges to zoning decisions. The course will also look at more recent trends and issues in land use law, such as smart growth and transit-oriented development, form- based zoning, marijuana regulations, short-term rentals, climate change resilience, and increased federal control of local land use. Finally, the course will examine the constitutional limits of land use regulation under the Fifth Amendment. Students will undertake practical exercises to introduce them to how land use lawyers practice. They will attend a zoning board hearing and report on it; they will analyze a client's proposal to determine what zoning relief is necessary; they will attend a zoning trial or appeal. The course will cover general zoning principles applicable nationally but will focus on Massachusetts law for the practical exercises. The class will require student participation in discussion. The only prerequisite is completion of first-year Property. Students will produce a brief paper on the zoning board meeting they attend and a final paper, and be asked to comment on the trial or hearing they attend.

The high cost of prescription drugs is one of the biggest public policy challenges of our time and is now an issue squarely in the cross hairs of federal and state antitrust enforcers. The cases that result feature the application of traditional antitrust principles, formed over the last century, to a unique industry with atypical economics, complex regulatory schemes, and extensive enforcement of patent rights.

Students will collaborate with frontline health care providers who serve marginalized populations on projects that require legal and problem-solving skills and where providers and/or patients have identified a systemic problem affecting patients' health and wellbeing.  In Spring 2022, we will be collaborating with Project RESPECT, an integrated obstetrics, addiction medicine, and behavioral health clinic at Boston Medical Center that serves low-income pregnant and parenting people in recovery from substance use disorders (SUDs), especially opioid use disorders (OUDs).  Project RESPECT providers have identified a problem in Massachusetts law that significantly harms low-income parents in recovery from SUDs and their children, disproportionately harming Black, Indigenous, or other people of color (BIPOC) families. Children born to women in evidence-based medication-assisted recovery (e.g., methadone treatment) must be reported at birth to the Department of Children and Families as if the mother were actively using drugs. Children born to BIPOC mothers are more likely than children born to white mothers both to be reported to child protection authorities and to be separated from their families as a result. The trauma of custody disruption has demonstrated serious effects on both recovering parents and child health and development.  We will explore and advocate for possible legal and policy advocacy solutions to these issues--for example, changes in mandatory reporting laws and reformed child protection agency practices to eliminate discriminatory decisionmaking.  Students will attend group meetings as well as work on research and advocacy.  The project work will allow students to hone their research, analytical, writing, presentation, and problem-solving skills.  Regular group meetings will deepen students' understanding of their projects by providing a broader context. Students will also meet individually or in teams with the faculty supervisor to discuss their project work. GRADING NOTICE: This class will not offer the CR/NC/H option.\n[  2 cr.]"

In the age of \"Big Data\" and \"Advanced Persistent Threats,\" these entities  can no longer focus solely on developing and implementing procedures to govern information processing. Instead, they must implement governance that allows for the optimization of risk while facilitating core management decision making in order to create real value.  This is the new world of \"knowledge governance.\"   Legal counsel must ensure compliance with the legal and core requirements for security, privacy and data breach prevention, in a way that aligns with the strategic objectives of their firm. Designing a robust compliance program is a critical part of this task, but the  big-data environment requires skills that go beyond devising a formal compliance program. In particular, lawyers operating in this environment must consider the value of data and information, understand the nature of their organization's collection, use, and disclosure of that data, and appreciate the relationship between risk optimization and their organization's strategic objectives.

The course involves both a simulated deposition component and a professional responsibility component. Simulated Deposition Course Component: Students will be divided into firms representing either the Plaintiff or the Defendants in a gender discrimination and defamation case brought by an attorney who has been denied partnership. The students will prepare and perform depositions of lay and expert witnesses and gather experience with obtaining and developing facts, preserving  testimony, and the uses of depositions. Professional Responsibility Course Component: The simulated context offers the opportunity to explore several professional responsibility issues that arise naturally in deposition practice. These issues emerge largely because of the dual professional roles of an attorney: zealous representative and officer of the court. Some of the more timely issues involve proper witness preparation, improper witness coaching, inadvertent waiver of privilege, and abusive tactics. Writing and Performance Requirements: Each week students will write a short one or two page comment on the professional responsibility issues raised in class. At the end of the course, students will perform a videotaped deposition rather than take a final written  exam. NOTE: This class may be used to satisfy the Professional Responsibility requirement, credits toward Experiential Learning requirement, or the upper-class writing requirement.

This course explores the unique aspects of working as a lawyer within an organization's internal legal department. In order to provide a realistic appreciation and understanding of the role of in-house counsel, the course will utilize scenario-based group tutorials and simulations in which students will act as in-house counsel for a fictitious company in a specific industry.  Areas covered may include contractual and employment matters, regulatory, compliance, internal investigations, enterprise risk questions and advising the Board of Directors and senior management. While the course will involve the substantive law of various areas relevant to the fictitious company's business and operations, the focus of the course will be on practicing and building lawyering skills that are critical for effective and ethical in-house practice. These include identifying and analyzing legally viable alternatives, and making recommendations, for the company to pursue to carry-out its business strategy and mitigate risks, as well as written and oral communications and presentations reflecting the same. As an overarching theme, the course will consider how to balance the important role of lawyer and trusted business advisor with the backdrop of the ever-present ethical and reputational considerations of the enterprise.  This course is designed to provide students with practical skills (as well as opportunities to use and apply them) as they learn to identify and navigate the day-to-day challenges of the modern corporate counsel.

Hence, the  course includes intensive team-centered workshop sessions where all students get  hands-on practice working with a group of peers to frame various problems in  appropriate analytical terms, develop a solution approach, and critically  reflect on the results.  Examples will be drawn from Strategy, Operations,  Technology Management, Marketing, and Finance to expose students to the broad  applications of the concepts and tools learned in this class.  Many of the up- to-the-minute Excel techniques covered in the course are now considered standard  in industry, and developing a good understanding of them will deepen the  student's ability to identify opportunities in which spreadsheet analytics can  be used to improve performance, drive value, and support important decisions.  Finally, students will learn the latest technologies for effectively linking  spreadsheets to relational databases, and to manage reliably large scale  spreadsheet development projects.\n[  3 cr.]"

Our energy, transportation, land use, building,  food and agriculture and socioeconomic systems are key contributors to the  pollution that leads to anthropogenic climate change and, at the same time,  shape our urban and rural communities and living conditions. Global impacts of  climate change on health are moderated by individual and community vulnerability  and resilience. Health impacts may differ by place, race and income as a result  of factors such as inequities in the distribution of economic power, historical  disinvestment in some communities, discriminatory practices and policies over  time, structural racism, higher pollution burdens and poor access to resources  for health benefits and improvement. As a result, certain groups including  children, the elderly, and communities of color are less climate-resilient and  more vulnerable to the negative health effects of climate change. This course  will explore the interconnections between climate change, health, and equity,  with a particular focus on upstream interventions to mitigate climate impacts  that may have co-benefits for health and equity. We will rely on examples within  the US as well as globally, to provide multiple perspectives including from the  global south.  \n[  4 cr.]"

The goal of this course is for  participants to gain experience in the overall grant writing process while  developing a proposal for funding to support dissertation-related research. Upon  completion of the grant writing course, the expectation is that participants  will submit their proposal for funding. The focus is on NIH/AHRQ F-series and  R36-type grants, though students are welcome to use the course to prepare a  grant for a foundation or other source of funding. Enrollment is open to BUSPH  doctoral students/candidates who are at a stage in their training where they are  prepared to actively develop a grant proposal for submission. \n[  2 cr.]"

They also develop skills for forming and leading groups. The Mutual-Aid model provides the central organizing framework, showing the worker (a) how to mediate between and among three domains-- individual member, the group as a whole, and the environment,  (b) how to respond to dynamics such as transference, countertransference, and issues of power and control, and (c) how to promote client and group empowerment. Building on knowledge and skills from CP 759 (Introduction to Clinical Practice), students learn how to use themselves effectively with diverse populations, in various community and clinical settings, and with differing member problems and concerns.  Social and environmental stressors on group members and the group as a whole are considered at all stages of group development and with a variety of group types. Since social workers must have the capacity to assume varying roles in groups, students learn to shift the nature of their participation depending on the situation, for example, to be a colleague in an interdisciplinary team of care providers, to be the leader of a neighborhood task force, and to be a clinician providing psycho-educational services to the parents of mentally ill clients.  The greatest opportunity for skill development in this course occurs when students take initiative to organize, lead, or co-lead groups in their placement, and all are encouraged to do so, if this is possible within the nature of the placement.   \n[  2 cr.]"

Students will   learn family systems concepts and theories that are foundational to the   practice of family assessment and intervention. A conceptual framework,   Liberation Health, will be used to assist students in understanding families   within the larger socio-political-cultural context. Students will also learn   Structural Family Therapy as an exemplar of a family systems intervention.   Skill practice and exercises will illustrate (a) individual versus systemic   thinking, and (b) the meaning of the symptom in the system. An important   outcome is that students will be able to facilitate communication among   family members. As part of this work, students will deepen their ability to   build alliances with the family as a whole, assess families using common   family assessment tools, and develop hypotheses about the family's   experiences, structure and internal dynamics that may have affected the   presenting problem. Students will practice family intervention techniques   such as circular questioning, maintaining multiple alliances simultaneously,   encouraging family members to speak directly to each other, contracting and   goal setting, strengthening the caregiver subsystem, exploring the meaning   of missing members, and identifying important family secrets and myths.   Emphasis is placed on the clinician's use of self in working with diverse   individuals and families who present with a range of problems. \n[  2 cr.]"

Readings from a variety of faith traditions, including Celtic Christianity and Native American  spirituality, will provide the theological grounding for the course.  Emphasis will be placed on  experiencing and developing individual and communal practices that connect persons to the  Holy in and through nature.  Students will be guided in experiencing nature as sacred subject  rather than object; as teacher, spiritual guide, companion, and neighbor.   The settings for this course will be Boston and the Alcyon Center, a spiritual life center in  Seal Cove, Maine, just outside the bounds of Acadia National Park, that hosts nature-based  retreat experiences (www.alcyoncenter.org) .   Four Boston-based sessions will be held on Fridays prior to the travel portion of the course.   These sessions will offer theoretical and theological foundations for the travel portion of the  course as well as an opportunity to connect with nature in non-wilderness settings.  The week after graduation, the class will travel to the Alcyon Center for several days exploring  holistic approaches to grounding spiritual practices in nature. With Acadia National Park as a  context, students will be led in hikes, nature walks, and other activities exploring how to  facilitate such experiences as spiritual practices.  Students will also be given the opportunity  to reflect upon and engage in the practices and operations of the Alcyon Center, which are  based in a rhythm of holy living grounded in nature.  These experiences will provide insight  into how spiritual traditions can impact more than just programming in such settings.  Other  class sessions will consider environmental stewardship and sustainability as individual and  communal spiritual practices with local resource persons and Alcyon Center staff providing  assistance.   A follow up session will be held at STH at the beginning of June.  Please note: * Each day in Acadia will involve 2-4 miles of hiking, most of which will be easy, but one or  two of which could be considered moderately strenuous depending upon one's ability. We will  do our best to accommodate persons with differing ability levels, but students should be  prepared to undertake this level of activity. * Meals at the Alcyon Center are mostly vegetarian (some chicken and fish) with a good  number of gluten-free options (though not prepared in a dedicated GF kitchen). There is  ample refrigerator space for students needing to tend to food needs that fall outside these  parameters.   \n[  3 cr.]"

It presupposes the  probability  of both recurring and unique situations in which the gospel (the \"good news,\" not  the final lection in the  ecumenical order) must be preached in a way both clear and arresting.  To deal with this presupposition,  the course will deal with preaching the gospel when some  situational feature of congregational or  organizational life demands attention.  Indirectly, it is  also an exploration of theological method.   In whatever situation, the preaching task will be  viewed as a theological one, i.e., as an opportunity for  discerning the import of and  articulating the gospel anew in a given situation. Thus students will be  equipped to be  \"theologians of the Word\" who can interpret situations from a variety of viewpoints,  evaluate  the usefulness of various tools for preaching in light of the gospel and then employ them   fruitfully. In order to do this, we will work on the following tools: 1. Bringing to critical  awareness our own understandings of the gospel, 2. Developing skills and resources as  contextual theologians in residence, , and  3. Developing skills and resources as homiletical  exegetes of situations. As a result students should develop greater pastoral sensitivity,  rhetorical savvy and think-on-your-feet  theological acumen while preparing for preaching in a  context in which transformational theological  leadership needs to be exercised.\n[  4 cr.]"

Drawing upon Jewish and Christian traditions, we will study theologies and   practices of Sabbath keeping and reflect upon their meaning in contemporary contexts. As part of this   work, we also will explore Christian theologies of the Lord's Day, including the meaning of Sabbath in   light of the life, death, and resurrection of Christ. The course will include attention to Jewish-Christian   dialogue as well as consideration of debates internal to faith communities about Sabbath keeping. We   also will focus attention on questions of Sabbath keeping and spiritual formation, Sabbath keeping as a   dimension of pastoral excellence, Sabbath as countercultural practice, and implications of Sabbath for   social justice. Students will be encouraged to cultivate a practice of Sabbath keeping throughout the   semester and as the culmination of the course they will have the opportunity to design a practical   theological project relevant to their own community and context of leadership.    \n[  4 cr.]"
