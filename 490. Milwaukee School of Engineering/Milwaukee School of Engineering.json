The study of Eastern philosophy does not solely take place for its poetic or other aesthetic values, but to comprehend propositions and to assess them in a process of developing coherent and defensible criticisms and positions. Introduction to Eastern Philosophy focuses on the arguments either explicit or implicit in Eastern philosophical texts and emphasizes careful reading of these texts.

Certainly, I know it only if it is true-only if it is actually raining outside-but does that suffice? No, because I might just be making a lucky guess.

The 20th century witnessed a sea change in the study of mind, with work in neuroscience and computation being central drivers. Developments in both philosophy and areas of natural and applied science, including artificial intelligence, prompted a re-evaluation of foundational questions in the study of mind. Should we abandon mind-body dualism and endorse some form of materialism about the mind? Is the mind simply identical with the brain? Can we explain, or explain away, the nature of consciousness? Is intentionality-the \u201cabout-ness\u201d of thought-the defining characteristic of mind, and, if so, how is it possible? How is it that we can represent facts about the world, such that we are capable of forming beliefs, desires, and intentions? Although these questions had been entertained in some form or another for millennia, novel work on computers and cognition opened a new avenue for considering them: namely, the attempt to design a machine that thinks, an artificial mind. Our goal in this class will be to explore and assess these questions at the intersection of philosophy of mind, empirical study of the brain, and artificial intelligence.

How could God allow suffering? Why isn\u2019t there more evidence for God? Does rational belief in God need an argument? Is faith compatible with reason, science, and evolution? Major elements of this course include close and critical reading of challenging philosophical texts, reconstruction and evaluation of philosophical arguments, and independent reflection and reasoning on topics and positions in philosophy of religion."

To do this, we will look at many of the prominent thinkers of the day, which may include: Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Gottfried Leibniz, Baruch Spinoza, Blaise Pascal, Mary Shepherd, Elizabeth of Bohemia, David Hume, Anne Conway, George Berkeley, among others. Many questions that dominated intellectual debate during those years will be discussed, such as: the nature of God, the reality/import of perception, ethics, the foundation of science, and the nature of human knowledge."

In this introductory course, students read dramatic works as literature and study plays as performance (recorded stage productions, film adaptations, and live shows). The course first surveys the history of the theater and drama. Students read and/or view works by diverse playwrights from different times, leading into a focus on US theater and current local productions. Students take part in a communal audience experience by attending one or more live performances, thereby gaining an introduction to Milwaukee\u2019s performing arts scene. In addition, students are introduced to the theater as a constructed space, learning about the engineering involved in today\u2019s live productions. Students thoughtfully write and present on these course topics and learn terminology that supports their skills in creating such responsive texts."

This course focuses on building the expertise needed to construct and train AIs using RL. We will learn about key concepts, mathematics, algorithms, and applications of RL. We will begin by introducing different types of RL problems and the algorithms available to solve them. Next we will introduce Markov decision processes which will give the agents we seek to develop a formal framework that they can use to solve problems. Following this, students will review and implement multiple classical and modern foundational RL algorithms to solve applied AI control problems. Environmental simulators, performance metrics, on/off policy algorithms, the exploration vs exploitation tradeoff, and state/action/reward engineering will be discussed. Lecture content will be reinforced with hands-on tutorial-oriented laboratory exercises for development of representative applications. Students will finish the course by designing, implementing, testing, and documenting an AI trained using RL on a problem of their choice."

The focus of such plans starts with collecting background data and developing a detailed understanding of the current situation. Often the planning process involves developing sophisticated computer models which are used to identify deficiencies and assess the potential benefits of new facilities. Watershed-based facilities plans simultaneously address storm water management, collection systems, flooding, non-point and point-source pollutant sources to achieve a required level of performance within an entire watershed. Transportation focused facilities plans may address motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians, railroads, airports, and seaports."
