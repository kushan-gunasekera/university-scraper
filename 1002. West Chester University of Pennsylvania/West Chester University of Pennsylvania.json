Drawing primarily from sociological and anthropological scholarship, the course will review some of the historical patterns and contemporary links between social and educational inequality. Students will be asked to consider the structural forces of inequality in neighborhoods and schools, and how those forces contribute to unequal opportunities, experiences, and achievement outcomes for students along lines of race/ethnicity, class, gender, and immigration status. Specific attention will be given to the impact of neoliberal policies on public education since 1980."

Likewise, a variety of education philosophies and practices within the region have had enormous sociological, political, and economic impacts on the region's populations. The principle aim of this course is to begin an exploration of Latin American philosophies of education. Particular emphasis will be placed on investigating the different ways that philosophers of Latin American education have conceptualized education as a (trans)formative and liberatory process. Our inquiry will be guided by these questions and others: What is the place of education in the forming of Latin American cultures, identities, epistemic paradigms, and social movements across the region? How have Latin Americans and those who study the region conceived \"education,\" \"teaching,\" \"curriculum,\" and \"schooling\"? How can we trace educational theory, practices, and institutions from the pre-conquest civilizations of the Aztecs, Incas, and others, to the communities and modern nation-states that make up contemporary Latin America? To what degree is Latin American education theory \"situated\"? What does it mean to suggest that education and knowledge can be colonized? What does it mean to suggest that people can decolonize knowledge and liberate themselves to strive in new cultural directions? How does philosophical inquiry into these issues illuminate the quest for justice and equality in education and civil society? And finally, how have a wide variety of contemporary Latin American social movements incorporated liberatory education practices into their struggles for social justice?.\nTypically offered in Fall, Spring & Summer."

What is knowledge for Latin Americans? Is it something generated only when teachers and students meet together? Or is it created spontaneously? That question implies concrete, but mostly philosophical, implications. In other words, it is an epistemological matter. This course is devoted to showing how we have built our epistemologies growing up in Latin America. Throughout history, foreign approaches tried to translate our thought. Currently, many scholars and international organizations are seeking to hear directly from us. This is why \"decolonial thinking\" is in vogue. Since you as an educator or teacher work with Latin American students on a daily basis, you have the opportunity to learn what knowledge and ways of knowing your students already have. This is related not only to what contents or skills your students already handle. This course will show you the way in which we have grasped our ways of knowing through our ways of being, since our cosmovisions, cultural learning, qualitative symbols, and stories have shaped our ways to know (epistemology) the world.\nTypically offered in Fall, Spring & Summer."

Stories are themselves ways of knowing for us, the Latin American peoples. The epistemological breakthrough that enabled narrative learning gaining a place within educational research has been a historically difficult process. Narrative learning can be traced back to the way in which indigenous peoples of Latin America have made sense of reality over millennia. This idea leads to the notion of narrative knowledge as a special form of reasoning, feeling, and grasping the world for us in Latin America. In our countries we translate knowing into telling and telling into knowing. Narrating or telling our knowledge is a special form of reasoning, feeling, and making sense of reality. In this course students will learn how narratives become the key aspect of an intimate relation between knower and the known for us. While we were growing up in Latin America, narratives shaped the manner in which we thought about what we know and how we know it. That process passed down from generation to generation. Thanks to the decolonial thinking perspective in vogue, today we have the opportunity of speaking for ourselves to explain our narrative ways of knowing and learning. Since you as an educator or teacher work with Latin American students on a daily basis, you have the opportunity to learn what knowledge and ways of knowing your students already have with them.\nTypically offered in Fall, Spring & Summer."

The purpose of this course is three-fold: 1) To provide an overview of the various models of organization and systems of governance that have existed within institutions of higher education and how these models have been altered during the neoliberal era, as well as an analysis of the philosophical and theoretical bases of these systems and practices. 2) To examine legal issues relevant to American colleges and universities in order to provide students with the fundamental knowledge of higher education laws and how these laws impact and shape post-secondary education within the neoliberal era. And, 3) to investigate the economic circumstances of higher education within the neoliberal era: the defunding of public higher education, the corporatization of management and de-centralizing of the faculty, the rise of for-profit post-secondary education, vocationalization of curriculum, the rising cost of tuition, and the resulting rise of student indebtedness.

Course readings and discussion will focus on various perspectives in the field in order to understand the key issues and debates confronting urban education. Students will examine historical, philosophical, political, economic, and socio-cultural frameworks for understanding urban schools, students, and teachers. The course is divided into three interrelated themes. Typical urban education courses examine and apply urban education theories without sufficiently studying the critical theories that ground said examination and application. Tacking in a slightly different direction, one of the aims of this course is to study theoretical frameworks that serve as the foundation for critical urban education theory and practice. The first theme of the course, Introduction to Critical Theories Applicable to Urban Education, introduces students to some of the canonical texts written by critical theorists from a variety of perspectives. Moving from Theme I to Theme II: Critical Analysis of Urban Education Philosophy, Policy, and Schooling, students will read the work of urban education specialists who conduct critical analyses of urban education realities in the United States. Because the aim of this course is to not only critique current urban education realities, but re-imagine and transform them, the course concludes with the study of Re-Imagining and Transforming 21st Urban Education, the third and final theme of the course. Taken together, the three themes of this course will empower urban educators to critically analyze and transform education in Philadelphia and other urban settings.\nTypically offered in Summer."

The US Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and the National Institute of Medicine, along with many other governmental and non-governmental health organizations and foundations have been calling for a more integrated (primary healthcare and behavioral healthcare) approach to services. Crucial to this approach is to understand the public health ramifications of food security and nutrition and the interconnectedness of these factors on a person's health and recovery. Also addressed will be the interplay of healthcare needs, culture, values, and barriers to access to care. Many integrated health organizations in the tristate area are looking for professionals trained in this whole health approach--able to work as part of an inter-professional team in collaborating with people toward improving health and supporting recovery. Health professionals and administrators from these organizations will be guest lecturers. Students will visit some of these organizations. Developing a hypothetical, integrated health program proposal (a team effort) is a key component of the course.\nConsent: Permission of the Department required to add.\nTypically offered in Summer and Winter.\nCross listed courses NTD 592, SWG 592."

We consider the contentious issue of whether films must remain \"faithful\" to a printed original and ask what it takes for a filmmaker to preserve the aesthetic value of an admired literary text when adapting it to the screen. The seminar also explores the role and particularities of adaptation in Latin American cinema to understand what makes Latin American adaptations unique. We investigate different theoretical approaches to adaptation in order to analyze the mechanisms of adaptation of literature to film. Students will acquire the critical discourse analysis and media literacy skills to evaluate narrative elements and discursive strategies used in both literary and filmic texts in Spanish. We also study the mutual influence of Latin American literature and film and examine the technical, artistic, and ethical problems that arise when adapting literary texts to film.

Unfortunately, wellness is often neglected in the modern-day human service professions. This course will challenge behavioral health professionals to consider the ramifications of not taking care of themselves while working with vulnerable individuals and populations who require us to be present and healthy. This course presents the theoretical basis for vicarious trauma, compassion fatigue, moral stress, empathetic distress, and burnout from both an ethical and a socio-cultural-political perspective. Also covered is the balance of self-care and community care considering of the privilege of an individualist approach compared to healing in community. Students will be challenged to consider the privileged narrative of doing work that they \"love\" when they need to pay the bills with ways to enhance satisfaction and support interests in issues of social justice. The Sanctuary Model will be explored as an example of an organizational response to wellness. Most importantly, students will gain hands-on experience from local experts in multiple self-care practices, including self-monitoring, stress management, yoga, meditation, visualization, and journaling. At the end of the course, each student will have a highly detailed and individualized wellness plan that they can implement and adapt as needed.

Crucial to this approach is to understand the public health ramifications of food security and nutrition and the interconnectedness of these factors on a person's health and recovery. Also addressed will be the interplay of healthcare needs, culture, values, and barriers to access to care.

Following a contextual introduction on the history of the Holocaust, students will learn about the different ways in which Holocaust survivors managed to recount the experiences that they endured, and students will be able to compare the experiences based on gender as well as on where survivors lived after the Holocaust. How did survivors, who chose to publish in German, experience a world in which German was classified as the perpetrator language? Students will also read Holocaust Survivor accounts written in Yiddish in German translation. What are the limits of language? What are the limits of Yiddish, which as a language has been perpetually threatened by extinction since the end of the Holocaust? These important questions will be underscored by an overview of the historical context of the Holocaust. The entire course will be conducted in German.\nPre / Co requisites: GER 326 requires a prerequisite of GER 202 or permission of the instructor.\nGen Ed Attribute: Writing Emphasis.\nTypically offered in Spring."

In particular, we will examine how women, persons of African ancestry, persons with disability, and other historically marginalized groups interact with medical knowledge and practice. Using the analytical tools of social constructivist theory, the course examines how medical knowledge and the practice of medicine can be agents used to maintain structural inequalities.

In particular it looks at the history of higher education and many of its academic disciplines in order to understand the origins of eugenic thinking, research, and advocacy, the prominence that these notorious and ugly beliefs had within the highest rungs of the highly educated elite, and the efforts of people with disability to resist eugenics. In this course students use the tools of history to grapple with a difficult question: how did so many seemingly \"good\" people that we associate with enlightenment, learning, and good works, fail to recognize the evil of their eugenicist assumptions, research, and public health recommendations? How can our historical study of persons with disability and their efforts to challenge ableism in the past guide our thinking and practice in the present?.\nGen Ed Attribute: Diversity Requirement, Speaking Emphasis.\nDistance education offering may be available.\nTypically offered in Fall & Spring."

Topics may include epic struggles between right and wrong, schools for magic, and a wide range of fantastic creatures. At the same time, students will connect these stories back to reality to explore the role of fantasy in describing complex emotions, troublesome events, and the lived effects of oppression and injustice.

In the first half of this course, students will learn about the development of the concept of human rights through an examination of its theoretical foundations, considering the tension between universality and relativity posed by the concept of universal human rights, and problematizing what this \"universality\" means for societies that perhaps have other, more pressing needs/priorities not included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In the second half of this course, students will focus on examining a variety of human rights cases as represented in multiple cultural mediums (including films, a poem, a novel, a diary, and documentaries) and practice analyzing these cases to pinpoint the various stakeholders and their interests in the issue at hand. In class, students will learn tactical mapping and the case study method, which will be brought into class discussions throughout the second half of the course as they consider each human rights case study. Lastly, students will practice imagining themselves within these situations and think critically about the different choices of action they would have as an actor in the issue at hand. Students will practice ethical reasoning in examining how best to act as they imagine themselves navigating the complex field of these human rights questions.\nGen Ed Attribute: Ethics Requirement, Humanities Distributive Requirement.\nTypically offered in Spring."

The main goals of the course are to expose students to a broad range of feminist thought and action and locate transnational feminist theories in relation to colonial and post-colonial narratives.
