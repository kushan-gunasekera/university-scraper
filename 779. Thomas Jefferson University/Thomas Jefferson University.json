Moving from Silicon as an electronic material, its mechanical properties are discussed which has been pivotal in the creation of the field of MEMS. A review of microfabrication technology conventionally used to form MEMS structures and devices using batch-fabrication is provided, which includes topics such as: photolithography, etching, physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, surface micromachining\u00a0and bulk micromachining. Soft materials and thick film processes are also discussed that have been key enablers for microfluidics and BioMEMS. The practical applications of MEMS for sensors and actuators are highlighted, where electrostatic, thermal, piezoelectric and magnetic transduction schemes are used for actuation and sensing, including for RF wireless systems and bio-related applications for Lab-on-Chip (LOC).\u00a0Students gain a broad perspective in the area of miniaturized systems for sensors and actuators.

Many systems today, such as HDTV, mp3 players, Internet audio and video, Voice over IP, digital communications, vehicular controls, machine intelligence, etc., use powerful DSP concepts as their foundations. DSP is a logical extension of Signals and Systems in which a comprehensive view of discrete-time systems is taken. The course content succinctly stated is an introduction to modern digital signal processing theory and techniques. This includes discrete time signals and systems, sampling theorem, Z-transform, frequency analysis of signals and systems, discrete Fourier transform, fast Fourier transform algorithms, digital filter design, and other topics (e.g. multi-rate signal processing, wavelets, linear prediction)."
