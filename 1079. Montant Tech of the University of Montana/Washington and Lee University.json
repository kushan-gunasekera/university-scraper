The lab portion makes use of demonstrations and engineering measurement exercises to complement the discussion of welding physics lectures. Computerized data collection equipment is used to record raw data from welding processes (primarily arc welding processes). The data is then analyzed to extract meaningful engineering information and correlated to weld properties. Lab exercises include measurements of weld heat-affected zone thermal cycles, solidification and cooling rate, heat source and melting efficiencies and weld pool geometry."
