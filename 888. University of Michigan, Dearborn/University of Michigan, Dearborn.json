Second, we will review all the major milestones of human growth and development. Finally, we will connect human growth to the social and environmental conditions that shape growth and human health. This course will engage with exciting hypotheses in the biological sciences and in anthropology to help us understand how our life course shapes who we are.\nThis course is designed to be intriguing to a broad variety of students, but particularly those interested in careers in the health-related fields. . Emphasis will be placed on critical analysis and communication skills that can be useful to students pursuing careers in any field. Required readings will be selected from a mix of older and contemporary literature and will reflect a diversity of ideas from scholars in many fields. The class is intended to be an interactive learning process with an emphasis on discussion and students are required to take a very active part in class. Students will also learn how to critically analyze research in the field. (F, AY)."

Or, the borders might be more abstract, like the assumed borders between race, class, and gender, or even the possible barriers we perceive between personal experience and world events. In this course, we will read stories about people who reflect on these kinds of border-crossings. We will then take a rhetorical approach to these narratives and examine how they work, what similarities they share, and importantly, how they address their audiences. Then, we will then produce--in turn--our own border-crossing essays that attend to the same issues of audience, context, narrative, and creativity. (OC)"

By studying the self-representation and culturally unique perspective of this emerging canon of writers, students in this course understand the emergence of LGBTQ literary traditions and understand the cultural diversity within these traditions. Students learn to identify the aesthetic qualities (such as camp, performativity, coded subtexts, homoeroticism, and the relationship between creativity and sexuality), and historical, political, and social concerns that characterize LGBTQ literary and cultural production. Topics covered include the struggle for civil rights before and after Stonewall, coming out narratives, the negotiation of homophobic cultures, post-colonial writers, and memoirs of the LGBTQ experience, as well as the historical emergence of sexual categories and the literary critique of heteronormativity. This course counts toward the English discipline diversity requirement. Students cannot receive credit for ENGL/WGST 471 and ENGL/WGST 571."

The question of stereotyping cultures will be discussed through examples of parodic representations of cultures. The course will also address the tensions between local ways of life (historical, linguistic, ethnic, and religious) and today's pressures for transnational and multiple identities, intensified by the communication of ideas and the movement of people around the world.

This period also was a time of increased international travel, international expositions, thriving private art exhibitions, and a flourishing print culture; all of these elements facilitated the rapid spread of information and images between Paris and Tokyo. We examine this dynamic flow of culture and ideas through the study of texts, photographs, paintings (Impressionist/Yoga/Nihonga), prints, advertisements, and fashion.

While it might seem like a simple question, many of our basic assumptions about the stages of life between infancy and adulthood have changed over the last 300 years. At the same time, children and teens have become increasingly central to our society and pop culture. This course examines how ideas about childhood and the experiences of children from different classes, races, and cultures have changed in the modern world. It uses the history of childhood to guide students in reflecting on their own path from high school to college. By introducing the idea that assumptions about maturity, adulthood, education, and work have changed over time, it gives students new tools for thinking about their interactions with the institutions and practices that mark the passage to adulthood. Children rarely leave behind their own stories in the historical record, so learning about their lives also means developing a range of creative investigative skills that will help students prepare for university-level research, writing, and analysis. Through these investigations, this course seeks to understand what children can teach us about ourselves and our values\u2014and why it is so hard to feel like an adult, no matter your age.

In this course we will see that \u201cenvironmental activism\u201d has a very wide definition, thereby countering numerous stereotypes and biases individuals have on this topic. Activists across all walks of life are tackling environmental issues around the globe and although they are united in their commitment to making a positive difference, they differ in background, experiences, nationality, culture, gender, age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion, political affiliation, and geographic area.

Well, let me try this simple definition: \u201cMysticism is a belief that people can directly experience and know true reality or unite with God or reach transcendence\u201d (let\u2019s stop here: the more words we use the more obscure the mysticism becomes). Anyway, all talk about mysticism boils down to \u201cmystical experience\u201d or actually experiencing the true reality. Those people who have had mystical experiences are called \u201cmystics.\u201d Mystical experiences of the mystics will be the starting and the central focus of our investigation. We will examine various examples of mystical experience from the literary texts, science fiction, and movies using relevant scholarly sources and lenses. Once you have good understanding of what mystical experience is, its characteristics, attributes and types and how mystical experience is socially organized, we will move on to explore various ways mysticism affects politics. I call those ways \u201cincursions.\u201d I have identified six \u201cincursions\u201d of mysticism into politics so far: (1) the Hero archetype; (2) political visioning, utopias and dystopias; (3) social movements\u2019 innovations; (4) reactions of the traditional religions; (5) mystical political philosophy, and (6) traditionalism and Alt-right. There may be more than six but six is enough for a class. We will spend some time discussion each incursion by drawing on a separate scholarly discipline, including psychology, history, anthropology, sociology, political philosophy, and political science. Most importantly, little has been known about the links between mysticism and politics so with enough dedication to this course you can make discoveries even if you have never personally had any mystical experiences.

Even before the United States became a superpower, it had military conflicts, trade agreements, and an expanding missionary, diplomatic and economic presence in the Middle East.  It is in this period that we find the roots of American interest in Zionism, the oil industry in the Middle East and the strategic importance of the Middle East to American interests.  In a parallel fashion, America begins to shift in Middle Eastern societies\u2019 thinking from being at the margins of their responses to European imperialism to being either a model ally or a new threat.

We will do this by first working through the foundational ideas and arguments as they are found in the work Kogzi (Confucius) and Laozi, analyzing the basic arguments and disagreements, which pave the way for subsequent thinkers. We will then look at the development of these ideas in the followers of these two schools of thought. We end by examining the original development of Buddhism in India, and its subsequent transformation to Zen or Chan Buddhism as it encounters Daoism in China. Given the significant emphasis on praxis (as opposed to theory) in both Daoism and Zen tradition, it will often be the case that the distinction between philosophy and religion becomes blurred. Eastern Philosophy has a long and rich tradition, often beginning with radically different starting points and concerns from its Western counterpart (although there are certain overlaps and similarities). As such, this course will offer a window into a set of philosophical discourses that have only recently been seriously examined in the West."

The controversy concerns two broad issues: first, whether \u201crace\u201d is a legitimate way to demarcate human groups, as opposed to, say ethnicity, or simply seeing all persons as individuals; and, second, whether the continued use of the category of race exacerbates racism. Contemporary philosophers have been making important contributions to these issues, addressing such questions as: what is the true meaning of the concept of \u201crace\u201d? Is the concept of race a mere myth or fiction? Does the use of racial categories exacerbate racism? What race is a mixed race person? What is the race of Latinos or Arabs? How can racism best be reduced and resisted? This course will explore recent philosophical work on the concept of race and the political effects of racial identities. Students will gain an understanding of how philosophers analyze and use concepts, especially as they apply to the politics of race in the U.S. Students will also gain a better understanding of the underlining causes of the rash of police lynching that has galvanized the Black Lives Matter Movement."

The former includes: What makes a film a horror film? The most obvious answer is that they have to be scary. But most classic horror films (e.g. Dracula (1931), Frankenstein (1931), etc.) will not frighten modern audiences. This would mean that such films are not horror films, which is clearly false; these are quintessential horror films. Is it immoral to watch horror films? Either because we are taking pleasure in watching films that depict unethical actions or because watching such films may desensitize us and inhibit our capacity to respond to victimization with compassion. The latter includes exploring the topic of personal identity through horror examples: A body theorist may be committed to saying that a zombie is a person since the body is still functioning and conscious. A mind theorist may be committed to saying that a vampire is a person since vampires retain much of their psychological content. (OC)."
