These ethnographic studies allow students to improve their specific knowledge of people and places throughout the world and also to develop more theoretically rigorous approaches toward explaining what is meant by the term globalization. To this end, students examine, among other themes, ethnicity to better comprehend issues of power, resources, and land in conflict situations; the movement of textiles to recognize post-Fordist social and economic practices; human trafficking to conceptualize commodification of the human body; and refugee migrations to understand transnationalism. In short, this course offers micro-level case studies, methods, and approaches toward learning about and explaining broad social and cultural processes.\nPrerequisites: Honors Program."

With the technology of today, we can gather data sets from many sources, some that are so large and complex (Big Data) that using traditional database management tools becomes difficult. Information management today must also deal with huge amounts of unstructured data that is being generated by social media in blogs, tweets, videos, speech, photographs, e-mails, and others. Not only are we faced with the challenge of how to store all of this data, but how we can effectively extract relevant information and visualizations from these disparate sources and gain valuable insights.

The approach taken in this course is that analytics is a tool that may be applied to achieve a desired outcome. Without a clear purpose or objective, the use of analytical methodologies is nothing more than a fishing expedition. It also follows that even when a clear objective is present, the application of analytics is only useful if the results of the analysis lead to reasoned action. Therefore, this course is more than a review of analytical methodologies. It is also about understanding problems, setting objectives, critical thinking and interpreting results.

Through regular presentations of their original writing to the class, students learn to harness their imaginative potential while gaining important craft tools in form, narrative voice, revision, and the discipline of the art of writing. The fundamental structure of fiction is examined in assignments dealing with setting, character development, imagery, plot, and theme. Multiple exercises and story assignments help students to work as writers do through the process of drafting, feedback, and rigorous revision. Outside readings illustrate how well-known writers have successfully dealt with writing situations applicable to student work. Additionally, students gain exposure to the contemporary writing world through presentations on literary journals, researching agents, college-level writing contests, and area readings.\nSession Cycle: Fall, SpringYearly Cycle: Annual."
