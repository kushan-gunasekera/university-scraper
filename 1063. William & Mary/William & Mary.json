The law of election security is a multi-disciplinary area which reflects the complex and vast election ecosystem. The purpose of cybersecurity is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems. The practice of cybersecurity law therefore is the practice of any law that enables these functional principles. Students will receive an overview of how these laws are traditionally applied to support these cybersecurity functional principles. The generic practice of cybersecurity law could be applied to the protection of nearly any information system and the information that travers those systems. Recent cyber attacks on democratic and election processes across the world, however, uncovered that the legal community is ill- equipped to address the particular challenges of securing election systems. It takes not only cybersecurity lawyers to consider a legal framework to support traditional network defense activities (for example, threat hunting), but also election lawyers to consider whether providing network defense services to campaigns, legislators, and election officials violates campaign finance laws, procurement laws or ethics regulations. It takes transactional lawyers to develop legal agreements for deployment of network defense, and national security lawyers to consider whether a private sector entity or governmental entity is acting as a foreign influencer outside of the United States. In short, it takes not only cybersecurity lawyers to develop appropriate frameworks for securing elections, but also election lawyers, corporate lawyers, procurement lawyers, and government ethics lawyers. There is a demonstrable gap in the legal profession of lawyers trained to understand and handle the complex and vast global election security ecosystem. This course will expose students to those gaps and provide a framework for considering solutions."

We will then apply the theoretical literature to actual case law and doctrine in both the civilian and the military contexts. One goal will be to answer core questions about the nature of sexual violence and the possible solutions to it. For example, can we coherently speak of sexual violence as one thing, as one social problem/pathology which is best analyzed using a single theoretical approach (and if so, which theoretical approach would be best?). Or does sexual violence have such different causes, and produce such differing effects across the legal spectrum, that we should view it as several quite distinct problems which are best analyzed from a context-drive, as opposed to universal point of view (and if so, what context(s) matter and what approaches would best be applied in each relevant context?). This will be a two-credit seminar which will meet once weekly. Major components of the course grade will be preparation, attendance, class participation, and a class presentation by each student.

We will begin with the disappearance of the Rule Against Perpetuities, which has enabled wealthy citizens (the new nobility) to maintain dynastic trusts over arbitrarily long horizons. We will then examine laws facilitating the creation of gated communities (modern castles) that enable the wealthy to live at greater separation from the rest of society (the new serfs). Other legal changes along with economic fundamentals have created a growing gap in wealth between the new nobility and the new serfs, making society more class-like, along with declines in social mobility and the aforementioned dynastic trusts. Finally, we will study legal rules that have fostered the growing influence of money in politics, and how it enables the new nobles to have inordinate influence in government, just as they had as attendees at the royal court in medieval times. We will assess the extent to which we may be well into the process of creating an upper caste that will have immobile wealth, high income, and influence on government that could last for centuries, like the barons and lords of feudal Europe."

Students will have the opportunity to conduct interviews of inmates and possible witnesses, as well as other preparatory case work with private investigators, forensics experts and attorneys.  The Clinic\u2019s focus will include DNA evidence, investigative activities, post-conviction remedies and procedures, and in-class simulations.  Students will gain an understanding of the various ways innocent people are convicted and discuss remedies for exoneration. In-class discussions will systematically prepare students to undertake the investigations necessary to assess prisoner\u2019s claims of factual innocence.  Although the investigations are as varied as the cases, they can generally be placed into two categories; (1) cases involving searches for DNA evidence, and (2) cases involving non-biological evidence. In all of the cases, students, supervised by the professor and MAIP staff and volunteers, will work with the prisoner, former attorneys, courts, and police departments to create complete files to determine an investigative strategy.  In DNA cases, students contact (and sometimes visit) courthouses, police departments, labs, and hospitals to determine whether any testable physical evidence remains in files or warehouses from cases that are often decades old.  In non-DNA cases, students will interview eyewitnesses, alibi witnesses, co-defendants, and, in some cases, alternative suspects, and perform other necessary investigation, again to include travel throughout the Commonwealth.  Occasionally cases also require travel to a prison in order to interview a prisoner.  Ideally, in instances where MAIP accepts the case and assigns it to an attorney, the Clinic students who worked on the case will remain involved with it, thus preserving continuity and providing students with an even fuller learning experience. Innocence Project II will be offered in the spring semester for those who choose to enroll and have successfully completed Innocence Project Clinic I; ideally the students from IP I will enroll in IP II, for a more in-depth semester of work and skill building on their assigned cases.

When is a confession voluntary; does the law think about voluntariness in a way that makes psychological sense? When is a criminal defendant mentally competent to stand trial? When may a criminal defendant be considered insane? What types of psychological defenses (defenses grounded upon mental illness)should a defendant be able to claim? When may a person be involuntarily incarcerated when (s)he has not committed a crime? What is the proper role of expert testimony? To what extent are the innovations of modern brain science, including technologies such as structural and functional MRI, relevant to judgments about legal responsbility? And so forth. Psychology and law have adopted overlapping, but also significantly contrasting perspectives on such issues. In this course we will investigate how psychologists work within the legal system and how psychological theories, research data, techniques, and methods might contribute to our understanding of the law.

These cases involve a broad range of considerations: risk management, public policy, politics, and reputation. For each case the students would be given the factual scenario, reports from the media, and other background materials. The students would be directed to issue spot and research the laws that could be involved. For each class the students would come prepared to discuss not only the scenario itself and the law implicated, but also appropriate responses by general counsels to each scenario, examining the pros and cons of responding to the situations in differing ways. Each student would be required to prepare a 3 to 5-page memo examining each of the cases, including analysis of key legal, public relations, and corporate citizenship issues. Each memo must also include recommendations on appropriate responses by the company/campaign/party involved in the case. The papers will be of the type used in practice by in-house counsel, in presenting emergency items to management and the board for action. In addition, each student would be asked to present his or her memo once during the semester to the rest of the class with the class assuming the role of the Board/management, and asking the student to discuss the identified issues and make recommendations.

Therefore, it is impossible to study with some depth in one single course all relevant and substantive aspects of European Union Law. In this introductory course we will study the basic Law of European Union (institutions, law-making procedures, legal remedies, role of the European Court, relationship between EC law and national law, all of this taking into account the recently passed Constitution). This will provide you with analytical tools to feel comfortable when you have to work in any area of substantive EC law. The method of instruction will be the typical interactive approach used in American law schools, although at times I will introduce or summarize a topic with a lecture. We will be using a set of teaching materials that you should obtain before the course starts. These materials are included in the book \u201cFoster on EU Law\u201d, by Nigel Foster. Class attendance is mandatory. Participation will be counted as an important part of the grade (50%). The exam will be a two hour exam with two or three questions based on cases pending before the European Court or important current issues in the legal and political development of the EU."

Government lending is governed by contracts written by the states and their creditors. Such contracts present complex legal questions. They often sprawl across multiple national legal systems. Because states can claim sovereign immunity, there are special challenges involved in enforcing such contracts. Finally, when sovereign states get into financial trouble there is no international financial trouble there is no international bankruptcy process that governs debt restructuring.

Is it possible anymore for people who have different political alignments and values to engage with each other in reasoned, respectful dialogue about controversial social and legal issues? This course is offered in the hope that it is possible at least at this law school. We will deepen our understanding of highly-charged contemporary issues, and of others\u2019 views on those issues, such as abortion, policing and incarceration, the equal treatment vs. religious freedom struggle occasioned by same-sex marriage, accommodation and acceptance of trans-gender persons, immigration, preferential treatment for particular groups in college and law school admissions and hiring, student protests at invited-speaker events, and\u00a0calls to abolish the child protection system. We will study alternative perspectives on each issue, not just the prevailing orthodoxy. The semester will begin with canonical texts in political philosophy and critical theory and sociological writings on political parties and perspectives in the U.S. today, to lay some foundation for subsequent conversations about particular contested social policies. Students will assume much of the responsibility for leading discussions and will write a paper at the end of the semester. (No exam)"

Integration of coursework and simulations will result in each student drafting, arguing, conducting case specific voir dire, and making decisions regarding challenges for cause and peremptory strikes, resulting in the selection of a jury of citizens from the community. Additionally, each student will deliver an opening statement to the selected jury and receive juror feedback.

Wythe understood the inevitable and critical interplay between the legal profession, politics and public policy. History suggests the legal profession has disproportionately impacted legislative outcomes.  Our focus this semester will be to examine how this principle remains a truism in the 21st century. In 2007, the Virginia General Assembly passed the highly controversial \u2018Omnibus Transportation Bill\u2019 that was dramatically impacted by the legal profession at every conceivable stage; and ultimately declared unconstitutional by the Virginia Supreme Court. This course will use this bill as a framework to more broadly examine the legal profession\u2019s influence on both the substantive and procedural history of legislation.  Active student participation will be expected as we analyze, dissect and advocate as appellants and appellees the constitutional merits of this legislation, offering individually, student drafted amendments to cure any constitutional infirmities."

How does traditional legal thinking and analysis work for lawyers in citizen leadership roles, often beyond a purely legal context? This class will address that question, and seek to broaden your approach to problem-solving. We will focus as a case study on how lawyer-leaders performed both in advising policy-makers and sometimes playing those policy roles during the United States\u2019 involvement in the Vietnam war. We\u2019ll assess the process of their decision-making, and see what lessons can be learned for all citizen lawyers. Henry Kissinger has commented that U.S. foreign policy has suffered in part because key players have often been lawyers, who lack an appropriate historical perspective in making decisions. We\u2019ll consider if that is a valid criticism and examine other ways that decisions might have been better made. We will also address the topic of Executive War Powers authority, which remains a live issue for our country today. This class is intended to sharpen your skills in conceptual problem-solving, and how to think beyond narrow legal frameworks when appropriate. The goal is to develop that most vital of all lawyer skills: good judgement. We will also assess how ethical factors contribute to better leadership decision skills. Class Approach: There will be a variety of assigned reading, selected in part from the books noted below. We will consider four groups of decision makers: White House advisors, the State Department, Congress, and the Pentagon, and evaluate how each \u201cclient group\u201d contributed to the decisions being made. Prominent guest speakers will be invited to address us as well. Student Eligibility: The seminar is primarily intended for second and third year law students. The course will be graded on Pass-Fail basis, based on class discussion and a short essay to be submitted after the course conclusion.

As a musical thinker, Beethoven engaged with the world around him, beginning as a court musician in Bonn, and with the Enlightenment and Age of Revolution as a composer in Vienna. The course begins with Beethoven as a pop culture icon, and then examines the real Beethoven through study of his life, 28th and 19th century Viennese culture, and his works. No previous musical experience is required, though encouraged."

There was no common law of marriage or probate, both of which came from canon law, or of trusts, which came from equity.  Devices like the fee tail, which we think of as ancient common law, were actually statutory. Judicial review might have its origins in the relationship between England and the colonies, not in traditional common law doctrines, and an important point of debate after 1789 was the degree to which the U.S. constitution had either abrogated or adopted the common law.  Over time, most of these competing legal systems have been incorporated into the system we know as the common law.  In this course, we will examine the history of the common law from its beginning in the 12th century to the present by looking at its interaction and competition with these different systems of law.  We will read and discuss both primary and secondary sources. Grading will be based on class participation and the written work submitted."

It begins with a brief survey of race-based law from the nation\u2019s founding through the Supreme Court\u2019s 1967 decision in Loving v. Virginia. It then explores the Critical Race Theory academic movement, perspectives on racial identity, race as social construction, and identity performance. And it examines the intersections of race and laws governing (inter alia) education, employment, criminal justice, affirmative action, and electoral processes. The secondary goal of the course is to explore ways in which the increasing diversity of society and of the legal profession affects the practice of law. Legal practice involves interpersonal activity, and all lawyers will interact with colleagues and clients whose cultural heritage differs from their own. This course thus explores the significance of culture and cultural differences in the practice of law. It introduces Intercultural Communication Theory - the study of interactions between people of different cultural backgrounds - to provide students (of all racial/cultural backgrounds) a framework upon which to enhance their capacities to communicate effectively and work productively with attorney colleagues and clients with identity backgrounds different than their own. Grading is based on (1) 2-3 short reflection papers or an in-class presentation (student\u2019s choice); and (2) a take-home (24 hrs.) self-scheduled exam.

It then moves on to focus on the types of legal instruments and transactions that trigger the application of the core federal securities laws. The main part of the course then takes an in-depth look at public and private litigation under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with a special focus on corporate-mistatement litigation as well as public and private insider trading actions. In so doing, the class will touch on a number of other aspects of securities litigation (including Securities Act of 1933 provisions, judicial overlays on the statutory regime, congressional reform to securities-fraud litigation, and class action litigation more generally.)"

Prior approval for CPT - for either a paid or unpaid internship - is required from both the University\u2019s Designated School Official (DSO) in the Reves Center and Dean Kaplan. Students cannot complete more than 15 paid CPT hours per week during fall or spring semesters. There is no weekly maximum hour limit for summer paid CPT. To apply for CPT authorization, the student and the student\u2019s supervisor must complete a CPT Objectives and Site Agreement. A written report by the student of at least five pages and a written evaluation by the student\u2019s field supervisor are due by the date in the CPT course syllabus. The syllabus also describes the format and content of the report and the evaluation. Credit earned for this course does not apply toward the total credits required for the JD degree, nor does the credit count toward the total pass/fail credits permitted for graduation. In addition, this course is distinct from credit-bearing externships. Credit earned and hours completed for the CPT course cannot be counted toward an externship, and externship credit and hours completed cannot be counted toward the CPT course. However, a student may earn CPT credit and externship credit for the same internship if the student satisfies the requirement for both courses."

This includes fundamental issues such as information sharing between public and private sectors, growth in offensive technological advancements, and effective employee screening. As theft of U.S. innovation continues to grow at an alarming rate, many companies have implemented counterintelligence and insider threat mitigation measures within their business framework.

Energy drives the economy, and the substantial investment required to produce, refine, transport, and deliver energy brings with it significant government regulation. We will focus primarily on economic regulation of energy at the Federal level, with some discussion of parallel state regulatory schemes and federal-state jurisdictional issues. The starting point is an understanding of the physical aspects of energy  -the different sources of energy and the practical aspects of extraction, refining, transportation,  and delivery to users-and the application of economics and antitrust law to understand the rationale for extensive federal and state regulation of energy industries. The course will consider early steps to regulate private industry for the public good, introducing students to principles of economic regulation, including dealing with natural monopolies, requiring certificates or permits for energy facilities, balancing the need for industry to attract capital with rate-payer protection through cost-of-service ratemaking, assuring \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rates and terms and conditions of service, preventing undue discrimination, relying on competitive market forces as a substitute for regulation (light-handed or market-based regulation), and partial deregulation. Key Federal agencies to be examined are the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Department of Energy. We also will touch on parallel issues at the state level, efforts to diversify energy sources and reduce environmental impacts, state-federal conflicts, and enforcement programs. Grades will be determined by a mid-term legal memorandum and a final paper."

We examine how anthropologists, historians, philosophers, physicists, artists, and scholars in interdisciplinary fields such as disability studies and indigenous studies have examined movement both as a practice that humans and nonhumans\u00a0do(or are limited in doing) and also as a concept that we\u00a0construct. As a practice, we will consider various forms of small and large-scale movement, including migration, pilgrimage, dance, trade, and navigation. As a concept, we will examine both the qualities associated with movement, such as dynamism, fluidity, flexibility, ephemerality, impermanence, rootlessness, vagrancy, etc. and also how these qualities are constructed as positive and/or negative depending on the socio-political, cultural, and historical context."

Students will review relevant legislation, regulatory guidance and enforcement actions, and case law. Students will also discuss policy considerations at play in the quickly evolving legislative and regulatory landscape. The course concludes with a mock scenario where students put what they\u2019ve learned into practice. This course is graded pass/fail based on class participation and contribution during the mock scenario."

Students will learn how a major state attorney\u2019s office handled death penalty eligible cases from the initial crime scene visit through the conclusion of the case. The course focuses on a specific case, the 2009 Thanksgiving Day murders of four family members in Jupiter, Florida, to examine how the charging decisions were made, including the relevant legal criteria and other non-legal influences. One of the exercises will involve having students conduct a mock capital case review committee meeting in a first-degree homicide. The course will identify the type and nature of cases that qualify for death penalty consideration. We explore factors that influence the decision to charge and/or resolve a capital case (including community pressures, views of victims\u2019 family members, and police/investigator influences). We will note the differences with regard to the death penalty in the various state systems and the federal system. The class includes a case study of the recent very public (and legal) conflict that occurred between then Florida Governor Rick Scott and State Attorney Aramis Ayala (Ninth Judicial Circuit in Florida). The dispute stemmed from SA Ayala\u2019s announcement after she took office that she would not seek the death penalty in any of her office\u2019s cases. We also will engage in a discussion of the federal death penalty prosecution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh to highlight the federal capital case process. The course also surveys the current state of the law regarding the death penalty in the United States. The discussion will include the evolving law relating to jury decision-making in capital cases using recent US Supreme Court cases. This course component will use a more traditional case analysis teaching method. Finally, the course delves into possible reforms of the death penalty decision-making process."

Its main focus is on the secondary market for public-company stock (namely, the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and the wide variety of off- exchange trading platforms in existence today). These markets perform important social functions: providing liquidity for investors and incorporating information into prices, which in turn serve as vital guides to real economic activity. The effectiveness with which these markets perform these functions and their costs of operation are determined in significant part by the rules governing exchanges, broker-dealers, and market makers. The course will begin with a consideration of major domestic capital market institutions. It will then address the economic theory that explains how these markets operate and the incentives that motivate their various players. This part of the course focuses on market-microstructure and finance theory. These beginning segments lay the groundwork for a more informed discussion of the substantive law that governs the markets, which takes place during the second half of the course. In that second half, regulatory areas to be considered include the rules relating to (1) transparency: who knows (and when) the prices at which securities are being offered and sold (the \u201cbid\u201d and \u201cask\u201d quotes) and the prices at which actual trades occurred (transaction data), (2) brokers duties with respect to execution of customer orders, (3) dealer rules for transacting directly with retail customers, (4) trading system alternatives to the NYSE and NASDAQ, (5) trader behavior including manipulation and short selling.The course, with its focus on persons who operate or trade in these capital markets as well as the market structure itself, should be distinguished from Securities Regulation, which is devoted primarily to the regulation of the behavior of the firms that issue securities and their agents. The course should be of use for students who plan on pursuing legal work relating to various financial-services industries. More generally, it will provide value to students who intend to work in the corporate, securities, and financial industries (or in the regulation of the same through the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the Financial Industry Regulation Authority (Finra), various state AG offices, among others)."

Attorneys general in forty three states are elected statewide on a partisan basis. The combination of sweeping jurisdiction and constitutional independence has given rise to a unique American legal institution of growing importance. The course will cover the day to day challenges faced by attorneys general and their staffs in delivering the high quality legal advice that will guide state government in a constitutional and ethical manner. The course will also cover the relationship of attorneys general with the federal government, the private bar, and a myriad of advocacy organizations. It will focus on some of the most controversial of legal issues - consumer protection, political corruption and criminal justice reform to name just three. Although each state is unique, the course will demonstrate the remarkable congruence that exists among state attorneys general when addressing similar challenges and issues. Unlike private and other government lawyers, who work subject to ethical rules that defer decision making to agency \u201cclients,\u201d for the 13,000 men and women it is the representing the \u201cpublic interest\u201d that is the day-to-day reality of their professional lives.

They are conditions that have defined the existence of modern populations, in various reincarnated forms, since the 15th-century. We will examine the perspectives and material experiences of various racialized subjects. Racial technologies have never worked alone, but are intimately tied to other forms of difference and inequalities. As such, this course explores how race is linked to gender, sexuality, and class, for example."

During the semester, we investigate Arab, Turkish, and Persian, musical systems in terms of musical instruments, styles, and repertoires, modal and rhythmic structures, and the effects of cultural policy and social history on musical life. We also consider case studies from Central Asia and the Islamicate world - places considered outside of the Middle East but which have much in common with it. Our semester is organized into four thematic units. First, we consider musical function and traditional contexts with special attention to folk genres and epic traditions. Second, we think about music theory/practice in the Classical Era and its intersection with cosmology, philosophy, and the emergent monotheistic religions of region. Third looking comparatively at the development of various urban music cultures, we will consider the musical and cultural impact of forces such as the Turkish Ottoman Empire, European colonial powers, and the Western, globalized, post-colonial world. Fourth, modern and contemporary musical phenomena, for example the recording and film industries, cabaret and popular music, music and migration, global hip hop, and the musical life of Middle Eastern peoples in the Diaspora provide a contemporary perspective on the present state of Middle Eastern music. The intersection of Music and Gender, Music and Spirituality, Music and Nationalism, and Music and Power, and Music and Conflict have been central to the work of ethnomusicologists of the Middle East (including me) and these topics permeate our semester. We also question the position of the researcher/author/artist throughout the semester with an eye and ear toward the (historical) ethnography of musical life. Students should complete the course with a new understanding of the aims and methods of ethnomusicology, the anthropological study of music of the world\u2019s peoples, as well as the inter-relationship between ethnomusicology and the humanities and social sciences. Prior coursework in ethnomusicology, anthropology, or global studies is highly recommended."

This course will explore the history of U.S. interventions in Latin America in comparative perspective by focusing on this region while also encompassing other parts of the world, particularly the Philippines, Hawai\u2019i, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Has the U.S. government forged its own type of empire through intervention, and, if so, with what strategic, economic, ideological, or humanitarian motives? In what ways have U.S. policies changed over time and in what ways have they appeared constant? We will assess both the stated and unstated goals of U.S. interventions since 1898, the conflicting perceptions and depictions within U.S. society of conditions leading up to them, and their short- and long-term effects. We will thus also explore the aftermath of U.S. interventions, including the dictatorships, violence, and radicalism that have variously followed in their wake."

The course will begin by reviewing the Multistate Bar Examination (MBE) subjects; the majority of the course will then cover heavily-tested Essay Examination subjects. The course will use Virginia as a default jurisdiction in order to benefit the greatest number of students, but will also benefit applicants in other jurisdictions. Practice-testing will use actual MBE and Essay Examination questions, and all substantive materials will be written by the instructor specifically for this course. The UBE Examination will also be covered. Students will be able to quantify their progress during the semester, both individually and relative to their peers. All students will also meet individually with the instructor to discuss their progress and specific steps they can take to maximize their success on the Bar Exam. This class is restricted to only those students who have been identified, based on academic performance, as likely to benefit from additional bar exam preparation studies. The Dean\u2019s Office will be responsible for identifying and contacting such students who will be notified and administratively registered during their third-year as a condition of graduation.\u00a0Grading will be Pass/Fail based on timely and complete submission of assignments.

But for many lawyers today, reading and interpreting statutes is more important. This course will provide you with an overview of the legislative process, which is the source of those statutes. It will consider the distinctive features of statutory law as opposed to other forms of law. Most importantly, the course will introduce you to various approaches to interpreting statutes and teach you the rules and doctrines of statutory interpretation used in federal and state courts - material with great practical value as well as theoretical interest. The course will also give some attention to the role of administrative agencies as implementers and interpreters of statutes. Grades will be based primarily on a final examination. Students who are taking or have previously taken Statutory Interpretation are not eligible to enroll."

In university training programs across the United States, the acting instrument is neutralized for use in popular references and mainstream performances (Ndounou qtd. in Perkins et. al, 2018, 124). Seldomly, if at all, does such training employ a culturally relevant pedagogy that includes the theoretical contributions or training interventions instituted by Black practitioners (Ndounou 124), nor provides opportunities for actors of the global majority to investigate the ancestral wisdom they carry and fine-tune these cultural instincts, sensibilities, and impulses. Black Approaches to Acting (Nommo Force: Black Acting Theories & Performance) adds parity to actor training at William & Mary, by training actors to identify and use practical elements of African diasporic cultural traditions as performance strategies, and to own and command their inherent Nommo Force. The course encourages Black actors to value the inherent ontology, epistemology, and methodologies they bring to bear on any text and in any performance, audition or rehearsal room."

In university training programs across the United States, the acting instrument is neutralized for use in popular references and mainstream performances (Ndounou qtd. in Perkins et. al, 2018, 124). Seldomly, if at all, does such training employ a culturally relevant pedagogy that includes the theoretical contributions or training interventions instituted by Black practitioners (Ndounou 124), nor provides opportunities for actors of the global majority to investigate the ancestral wisdom they carry and fine-tune these cultural instincts, sensibilities, and impulses. Black Approaches to Acting (Nommo Force: Black Acting Theories & Performance) adds parity to actor training at William & Mary, by training actors to identify and use practical elements of African diasporic cultural traditions as performance strategies, and to own and command their inherent Nommo Force. The course encourages Black actors to value the inherent ontology, epistemology, and methodologies they bring to bear on any text and in any performance, audition or rehearsal room."

Foreign interference of U.S. elections and the Capitol attack of January 6, 2021, have both exposed unprecedented vulnerabilities; widespread disinformation and misinformation campaigns; abuse of voter data and consumer data in psychographic profiling through voter manipulation and AI-driven voter microtargeting; underregulation of social media platforms and Internet governance; shortcomings to national cybersecurity policy and the failure to develop effective cyber deterrents; and what federal oversight of election administration and voting systems may be necessary while still respecting federalism principles and state sovereignty. Multiple intelligence reports have described the foreign interference of U.S. elections as an \u2018influence campaign\u2019 that blends covert cyber operations and overt propaganda operations. The course will explore how legal, policy and corporate reform efforts can be shaped by the emerging fields of cyber ethics and data ethics. The seminar will include a close examination of the January 6 Reports and intelligence reports, Special Counsel\u2019s indictments, and other original source material to better understand the nature of interference in U.S. elections. It will focus on the interdisciplinary research of experts in multiple fields; data and information science, ethics, privacy law, cybersecurity, national security, federalism, state and local governments, corporate governance, election law and voting rights, media and communications law, internet governance, civil rights and civil liberties, international relations, and political science and political theory."
