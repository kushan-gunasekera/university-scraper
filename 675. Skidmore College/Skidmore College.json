You will be responsible for teaching some of the class material; your class session will be open to the Skidmore community.  The course unfolds over three stages. Stage 1: I provide background in and moderate discussion on several topics, including power in teaching and learning, why group work is an effective learning technique, Nazi use of material culture to exert power (the Nazis were the orginators - and preeminent practitioners - of multi-media exertions of power), the resistance found in material objects to Nazi power, and how American mid-century modern design reinforced sexist and racist power dynamics. The sections on Nazi and mid-century modern design serve as models for you to reflect on when you prepare to teach your classes on American topics (stage 3). Stage 2: You prepare to teach with my support. This includes reading and discussing texts on effective teaching and group work developing a teaching plan on American material culture.  You will master your topic, decide what your peers must know about it, how best to convey that information, what kind of homework to assign, and what kind of deliverable your peers will provide. Stage 3: You teach course material."

This course will explore map design and appropriate use of increasingly complex presentation strategies starting with PowerPoint, followed by Google map engines and embedded internet applications and culminating with ArcGIS Online driven story mapping. Students with prior GIS experience will be able to create their own map data, while those uninitiated in GIS will be able to use existing data sets to achieve powerful and appropriate visualizations. The course allows for those with significant presentations at the end of the semester, such as capstone projects, to apply visualization and presentation methods gained in this course in those projects."

        "course_description": "Examination of global mental health from an anthropological perspective. Students study medical anthropology theories that interconnect biological, social, and cultural aspects of mental illness, particularly among vulnerable populations. Course materials focus on common mental disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, trauma-related disorders, and addiction. Students analyze ethnographic case studies of mental health experiences and treatment in diverse social contexts, such as displacement (of refugees and migrants), water insecurity, disaster recovery, and military conflict. Course discussions foster understanding of traditional versus biomedical beliefs about mental illness, intersections of mind and body, and access to health care. The course also considers how community-based and humanitarian interventions aim to improve mental health and advance global health equity."

In this seminar, drawing on case studies from different times and places, students learn to recognize the importance of material objects in the social world and their own lives. How do objects help people define their identity, structure their lives, remember the past, and facilitate action? What personal and collective stories do objects tell? Do we control the objects around us, or do those objects control us? Among the types of objects studied in this course are sentimental objects, collectibles, memorials, protest art, and technology."

Students will survey philosophical, psychological, neuroscientific, anthropological, and computational approaches to understanding this question-an interdisciplinary field of study known as cognitive science. Cognitive Science defines itself through the types of questions it asks and the methods used to answer them. One fundamental approach to developing our hypotheses and theories involves the development of models testable representations of these processes and ideas. These models are tested and refined against the array of low-level physiological processes, individual behaviors, and group and global systems that define our cognitive world. As we iterate this modeling-testing loop, we hope to come closer to understanding the foundations of thought and mind. Students will also survey the fields associated with cognitive science and discover how its methodologies interconnect them. Traditional computational and mental-representation models as well as a few alternative propositions involving dynamical systems will be examined through rigorous study. As a result, students will gain tools to broaden and inform their inquiry in any field that focuses on the mind and thought."

In addition to gaining an understanding of the current state of empirical psychological research on cross-cultural development, students will gain the ability to apply insights about cross-cultural development from anthropology, sociology, and history to the study of psychology. More generally, students will question and critique the development of policies and norms related to children, and will ask questions like: Who gets to decide what \u201cnormal,\u201d \u201chealthy,\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d childhood environments look like? In what ways do powerful individuals and institutions police, restrict, and limit child development? What are the consequences for violating cultural norms during development, and can we seek justice for those who have been wronged? In this way, students apply what they have learned about cross-cultural development to critical questions of power and justice in contemporary America."

We will learn about philosophical, psychological, and theoretical perspectives on the relationship between bodies and identities. By focusing on bodies in transition (i.e. bodies that are intentionally or unintentionally changed), we will interrogate the question: when and how do the properties of our bodies impact our identities? We will also ask about the intersection of power, identities, and bodies in contemporary America: how do systems of power and oppression shape the ways that we view and psychologically study ourselves and our bodies? Given that there is systematic body-and identity-based oppression, what does justice look like from a practical, psychological, and scientific perspective?"
