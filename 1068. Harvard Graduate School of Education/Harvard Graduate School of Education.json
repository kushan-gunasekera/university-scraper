These theories will include disruptive innovation, Jobs to Be Done, interdependence and modularity, discovery-driven planning, tools of cooperation, and more. Each week, students will teach these theories to each other in a guided discussion and then apply the theories to a range of educational case studies and current educational events in the K\u201312, higher education, and lifelong learning realms. Learning activities will include case study discussions, active learning in which students teach each other, limited lecture, and opportunities to interact with special guest experts.

This seminar illuminates the origins, purposes, and features of this method, placing it within the larger discourses of social science disciplinary frameworks, and mapping it on the broader terrain of qualitative research. Through researching and writing portraits of individuals, institutions, relationships, processes, or concepts, students learn the tools and strategies of rigorous data gathering, systematic empirical description, discerning analysis, and narrative composition. This is a working seminar with class members serving as discussion leaders, critics, authors, and respondents of each other\u2019s work.<br /><em>Application and permission of instructor required. Enrollment is limited to 15. Prerequisites:\u00a0background or strong interest in research design, qualitative inquiry, aesthetics and empiricism, literary narrative, or the arts, as well as strong idea(s) re: portrait subject/topic.

In this course, students will gain experience reading, critiquing, and replicating five common approaches to measuring program impacts: randomized trials, regression discontinuity, difference-in-differences, covariate adjustment (including &ldquo;value-added&rdquo; models), and matching. We will discuss recent quantitative evidence on important education policy topics, such as charter schools and vouchers, school spending, and college financial aid.

For example, what should be done about a student with diagnosed emotional issues who frequently disrupts class, but who benefits from being mainstreamed? How should educators contend with divisive political rhetoric in schools, in the context of a highly-polarized, hyperpartisan democracy? How should policymakers and educators attend to the risks of pandemics without furthering existing educational inequalities? How are efforts to correct educational inequality, such as school closures or teacher evaluation policies, injustices in and of themselves? This course addresses these questions by engaging with philosophical, theoretical, and empirical readings from a variety of disciplines. We will grapple with case studies of ethical dilemmas from classrooms, schools, districts, and organizations at the K-12 and higher education levels in the United States and, to some extent, abroad. Our goals will be to deepen our own understandings of educational justice, to engage with others about complex ethical judgments across multiple lines of difference, and to learn how to enhance educators&#39; and policymakers&rsquo; capacities to make ethical decisions under challenging conditions.</span></span></p><p><em>No prerequisites.

The ability to do this well is an essential component to successfully practicing the skills needed for virtuous action. The class will be largely case-based, but also introduce moral and political theory and material from adjacent fields as needed to work through the cases.

American schooling assumed its modern form at the beginning of the 20th century and still bears the heavy imprint of its industrial era origins as a command-and control-bureaucracy. This course will examine what it would mean to rethink those assumptions and design anew a 21st-century system that would support deeper and more engaging instruction for all students. Students will move across levels, ranging from in-depth exploration of the nature of good teaching and learning at the classroom and school level, up through what district, state, and federal polices would support such a transformation, as well as how other countries have organized their systems to aim for high-quality schooling for all students.

In addition to our class time, each week you will engage in a self-scheduled coaching practicum where you use a research-based coaching format to work with peers to practice key skills related to coaching with equity in mind. These skills include developing rapport, building trust and psychological safety, actively listening, effectively questioning, working through levels of dialogue and providing actionable feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>At the beginning of the course you will coach a peer on how they communicate their commitment to equity, and then later you will coach a different peer on cultivating their chosen equity leadership disposition (https://www.leadershipacademy.org /resources/equity-leadership-dispositions-2/).

By the end of the course, students will be able to answer questions such as, &ldquo;why do conventional school structures persist despite limited evidence of their effectiveness?&rdquo;; &ldquo;why do so many education reforms come and go and come again?&rdquo;; &ldquo;how can deeply ingrained beliefs and practices in schools be transformed by school stakeholders?&rdquo; The course is targeted primarily to doctoral students, research-oriented master&rsquo;s students, and any highly motivated student interested in gaining an in-depth understanding of the institutional processes in school organizations, systems, and sectors.

Yet, the Eurocentric hegemony of knowledge in many educator preparation programs often means that educators, including Black educators, have little or no opportunities to study Black educational thought and praxis. This 2-credit module centers on the pedagogies and practices of the Black liberatory education tradition, offering students the opportunity to learn about and from Black educators and intentionally All-Black education school spaces K-12. In this module, we will explore Black-led schooling movements in the U.S. historically (post-1954) and in the present day (e.g., Black Panther Liberation Schools, Independent Black Institutions, Afrocentric Schools, and Homeschooling) as well as out-of-school Black education spaces. We will also explore the philosophies and teaching approaches of liberation-focused Black teachers in all-black schools. Collectively, we will ask: What have been the goals, priorities, and purposes of intentionally all Black education initiatives for Black children in the United States post-Brown? How have Black educators conceptualized, articulated, and actualized liberatory Black educational praxis in the face of endemic Anti-Blackness, systemic marginalization, and active resistance in the U.S.? How have intentionally all Black schools sought to leverage education spaces as a pathway for healing, resistance, and social change for Black children?

Course taught by Chen Yidan Visiting Global Fellow, Gavin Murphy. This course explores the power of collaborative approaches in promoting educational equity, by examining case studies that highlight the transformative impact of inclusive leadership in teacher professional development. Additionally, we will focus on three specific case studies from the Republic of Ireland. The first case study explores the developmental potential of action and improvement plans in addressing educational disadvantage, examining the &ldquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rdquo; policy and its practice implications in the Republic of Ireland. The second case study delves into LGBTQ+ inclusion, showcasing how collaborative professional development initiatives have empowered pre-service teachers to create inclusive and affirming environments for LGBTQ+ students. Lastly, the third case examines the role of inclusive mentor leadership with pre-service teachers during their clinical placements, exploring how mentor teachers can support and guide future educators in developing their leadership capacity. Underpinning all these examples, we will explore the interconnections between distributed leadership and its potential for capacity building to promote inclusive leadership and educational equity. By analyzing these real-world examples, students will gain practical insights and strategies to enhance equity and inclusivity within their own educational contexts.&nbsp;</p>"

By working through specific cases, this course will illuminate larger operational and strategic issues that are part and parcel of the work of a school leader.&nbsp;While some cases will be drawn from the instructor&rsquo;s direct experiences in leading an independent school, the issues addressed will be central for students aspiring to lead all manner of schools:&nbsp;public, charter, faith-based, and private.&nbsp;Readings will be drawn from several sources that focus on the nature of leadership, from the world of schools to explorers and even to the American presidency.</p>"

Feeling safe and welcome at school has direct and measurable effects on students&#x27; academic achievement; but how do we create loving spaces for learning? This module will explore empirical evidence that supports the creation of safe, loving schools and provide examples of best practices for educators seeking to prevent bullying and discrimination.

Over the past several decades, policymakers and the public have called on schools to not only fulfill their core goal of developing students\u2019 academic skills, but also to address students\u2019 well-being and postsecondary readiness. Meeting this need has been further complicated by the arrival of COVID-19 and persistent racial inequality in educational systems.\u00a0<br/> School counselors, school adjustment counselors, and school social workers play a key role in building counseling and student support systems to support young people\u2019s development and to further educational justice; however, these professional roles are too often poorly understood, outdated, and rarely actualized efficiently by educational leaders.\u00a0<br/> With a focus on school counseling for equity, students will collaborate on a course-long project to develop a school counseling program for a particular school or student population. The course will examine the role of the counselor at multiple socio-ecological levels, starting from the counselor\u2019s individual role and expanding out to the counselor\u2019s role as a part of school and district systems.\u00a0 The course will equip students with frameworks to implement or support high quality and equitable counseling and student support programming and will provide opportunities to practice.<br/><br/><em>This course is required for all students seeking school-based counseling licensure.</em></p>"

Then we work consciously with unhelpful habits of thought and behavior, especially those that perpetuate personal suffering and systemic injustices by mindfully exploring emotional reactivity, biases and interpretations, and enhancing self-care to sustain ourselves and our work for justice. We then apply our skills to deepen our understanding of who gets protected and who gets harmed in social power dynamics in our home countries and contexts, skillful communication across differences, and practices that support healing from the impacts of injustice from our varied identity locations.

We explore questions such as: What is ethnic-racial identity (ERI)? What theories have informed our understanding of how this developmental process unfolds for young people? How do social spaces that youth inhabit regularly inform their ethnic-racial identity development? What do we know about the links between ERI and adjustment? How can adolescents&rsquo; ethnic-racial identity protect them against risk factors such as ethnic-racial discrimination? &nbsp;What&rsquo;s the mechanism by which ERI promotes positive youth development?<br /><br />After building a strong theoretical and empirically informed foundation on this topic, we turn to examining the Identity Project curriculum, which was designed to intervene in adolescents&rsquo; ERI development in a school-based setting.

For children, early childhood is characterized by rapid growth and learning that sets the stage for lifelong development. For families, raising young children can be both rewarding and introduce a range of new economic and social stressors. In the United States, a patchwork of social policies and publicly run programs provide young children and their families with education, care, and social supports. Why and how might these public policies and systems matter for young children&rsquo;s development? How do the policies and systems currently function and how might they be improved to support child development and family well-being equitably and effectively? This module will explore these questions through an examination of policies and systems related to family support (e.g., economic assistance and anti-poverty efforts), early education and care (e.g., subsidized childcare and preschool), and whole child support (e.g., Head Start&rsquo;s comprehensive service model, health and mental health programs). The module is intended to support students with diverse interests in early childhood practice, research, and policy in drawing connections between high-level systems and policies and the experiences and outcomes of children and families.

How are all of these questions shaped by history, politics, and race? Students will learn how to act on these questions through readings, discussions, live cases and a final project. For the live cases, students will be faced with a real-world actor confronting a current dilemma and will be asked to diagnose the problem and develop a strategic approach to addressing the dilemma in a particular context. Students will also do a semester long &quot;Make the World a Better Place&quot; project, through which they will learn and practice critical skills like empathy, listening, defining problems, brainstorming, prototyping, and testing. and change management skills through applied work in an area of their choice.

Thus, surveys wield tremendous impact on the data based decision making that increasingly permeates our educational system and in society more broadly. Yet producing high-quality survey measures is not a straightforward task. Survey designers must choose between open ended, ranking, or rating items; between asking questions or posing statements for respondents to agree/disagree with; how many response options to offer; and the organizational logic of their survey. Empirical studies exist to guide each of these choices and maximize the quality of the data collected. This course will familiarize students with the steps and procedures that are essential to developing high quality surveys. The major topics of the course include defining constructs; creating items and item wording; response anchors; organizing, ordering, and formatting surveys; and bolstering response rates. The course is not designed to cover sampling procedures, analysis of survey data, or interviewing. As a final project, students will design a short questionnaire.</p><p><em>Prerequisites: none, though successful completion of S-012 or S-040 is strongly encouraged.</em></p>"

We will explore the history of visual art in childhood theories including Froebel, Montessori, Reggio Emilia, as well as its positioning in public education curriculum in the United States. How is creativity defined, and why is it important in education? How can the experimental practices of contemporary artists and designers be used to actively support children\u2019s learning? How can we evaluate children\u2019s learning through art? How can we challenge the euro-centric canon of art history to position contemporary artists from diverse backgrounds as central in arts education? Each week students will engage in a 1 hour 15-minute theoretical workshop in which we will discuss, debate, and reflect on education theories outlined in the readings and make connections with the overarching course questions. Students will then participate in a 2-hour studio workshop in which they will learn about contemporary artists, experiment with art materials, and engage in the specific technique of \u2018pedagogical curation\u2019, a curatorial strategy for connecting art practices and the design of children\u2019s learning environments. This strategy will include practical steps for sourcing materials, researching diverse artists, evaluating learning outcomes, and scaffolding children\u2019s learning through the selection of materials, tools, vocabulary, and techniques. Through group discussions, readings, art museum visits, and hands-on making, students will gain a rigorous understanding of innovative theories and practices for connecting contemporary art and children&#39;s play.

        "course_description": "<p>There is widespread agreement in education that schools must engage young peoples&rsquo; cultural experiences as resources for learning and fulfilling the promise of education in a pluralistic democracy. Learners come to school with diverse funds of knowledge&mdash;and honoring and extending these funds of knowledge is a fundamental matter of educational equity. Arts education has a vital, if underutilized, role to play in realizing this educational vision. Through the arts, we engage in symbolic practices that help us make sense of our experiences, sustain our sense of connection to our communities, and begin to imagine and enact self-defined futures. In this course, we will consider the role of the arts in supporting a greater sense of wellbeing and justice in a wide range of educational spaces. We will draw on the theoretical foundations of art and culture to investigate the role of creative expression in fostering meaning-making, identity, and solidarities across lines of difference. Through historical readings and active discussion, we will attend to the imperial and assimilationist origins of art in the United States, and we will draw on current events to help us think expansively about the role of the arts in supporting struggles for self-determination, intellectual freedom, and social change. Ultimately, this course is intended to equip students with deepened understandings about the intersections of art, culture, and education, and with background knowledge to think critically about the affordances and challenges inherent in supporting a sense of creative wellbeing and justice through arts education.</p>"

In doing so, students will confront the intra and interpersonal challenges and strengths of multiple socially constructed race groups by examining the branches of CRT that focus on people of color, including Latinos, Asians, and Native Indians, and the use of CRT to examine Whiteness. Students will also investigate issues of epistemology and research methodology in CRT, which will ultimately be useful as they then examine the experiences of students of color in the K-12 and higher education realms through a CRT lens, and the potential uses of CRT in research, teacher education, and the teaching and learning process writ large.</p>"

        "course_description": "<p><strong>*Lottery-Based Enrollment*</strong> The duration of education is a strong predictor of health and longevity, but approximately 1 in 5 children with learning or attention issues have long-lasting negative consequences related to their academic, social, mental health, vocational, and economic outcomes. In the US, over 2 million students struggle with specific learning disabilities (SLD), which represents roughly 35% of all students who receive special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Children with a learning disability are less likely to complete high school or enroll in postsecondary educational programs and have a heightened risk for developing mental health problems such as depression or anxiety. Currently, SLDs are primarily identified and addressed within the education system; however, these students also receive care and support outside of school and are members of various community settings. A streamlined approach that informs the coordination of general education, special education, clinical psychology, policymaking, advocacy, caregivers, and health professionals (e.g., pediatricians, speech-and language pathologists) is often absent and hinders the design of preventive approaches, identification strategies, and service implementation. It further leads to a siloed approach for care and policymaking, and a lack of community supports.<br /><br />This&nbsp;course will provide a broad overview of learning disabilities and differences, including dyslexia, dyscalculia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, developmental language disorder, and autism spectrum disorder, as well as the relevant policies and educational documentation for these learners. It will then cover the professional stakeholders that should be involved in an evidence-based response to a learning difference, and identify their unique knowledge base, toolset, developmental timeline, and communication strategies, both in the educational/professional environment and the community. Finally, we will focus on barriers and challenges faced by children with learning differences in academic, professional, and community settings. Throughout the course, students will be provided with research/evidence-based content as well as case-based learning opportunities, practical examples, and guest speakers drawn from the community. Class activities will include both synchronous and asynchronous learning activities led by the instructor, along with breakout sessions overseen by the instructor and/or teaching fellows.<br /><br />This course is divided into thirds and will cover: (1) a broad overview of learning disabilities, educational policies, and service documentation; (2) stakeholders in academic and professional settings (including their unique knowledge base, toolset, developmental timeline, and communication strategies), barriers faced by children with learning differences in these settings, and existing solutions to these barriers; and (3) stakeholders in community settings, barriers faced by individuals with learner differences&nbsp;in these settings, and existing solutions to these challenges.</p>"

We pay attention to the ways various strategies can reinforce or disrupt inequities in student achievement and classroom power. As a methods course, Instructional Leadership supports practitioners who will return to schools to apply what they\u2019ve learned. Classes are designed with activities to practice skills such as: regular analysis of teaching (through video), small group work to align on quality, simulations of various improvement practices, and a requirement to observe teaching at least once each semester in a school.\u00a0</span><br /><br /><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-family:&#39;georgia&#39; , &#39;times new roman&#39; , serif\">Instructional Leadership (T392A and T392B) is a</span><strong style=\"background-color:transparent;font-family:&#39;georgia&#39; , &#39;times new roman&#39; , serif\"> 4-credit, year-long course</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-family:&#39;georgia&#39; , &#39;times new roman&#39; , serif\"> (2 credits in the fall, 2 credits in the spring), with the option of taking the course for the fall semester only.
