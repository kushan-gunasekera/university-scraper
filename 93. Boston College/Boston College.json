Each course focuses on a different set of MBE subjects and course materials for both courses include access to an online early bar preparation portal. While the materials are similar to the materials that students will use when they are studying for the bar examination after graduation, they contain additional exercises to help students break down the mental process necessary to effectively answer multiple choice questions in a high stakes testing environment. Students have access to substantive outlines, lecture handouts, video lectures, and MBE questions. The course is NOT a substitute for a summer bar prep course, but rather is an opportunity to develop skills essential for success with live professor feedback and at a pace not available during the intense 10 week bar study period."

While we will be reading and studying together as a class, we'll also be interacting with (and reading alongside) law students and lawyers from around the country. Students in the course will have the chance to learn from and question practicing lawyers.

        "course_description": "This course examines the legal underpinnings and enforcement strategy of federal criminal civil rights laws, and explores how they have responded over time to changing societal mores. The areas of focus include (1) the willful deprivation of constitutional rights by officials acting under color of law e.g. police brutality; (2) federal hate crime laws; (3) violent interference with reproductive rights; and (4) human trafficking.\n\nIn each of these areas, the course will examine the laws that have been passed to address the protection of these rights from criminal interference. In particular, significant Supreme Court and other appellate court cases that have shaped the application of these statutes will be studied. For example, the course will address the history of Title 18 U.S.C. 241 and 242, which emanate from the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Supreme Courts constitutional interpretation of those statutes; the passage in 1968 of modern federal hate crimes laws and judicial interpretation of those laws; and the statutory evolution of hate crime and anti-trafficking laws, highlighted by the enactment of the 2000 Trafficking Victim Protection Act and the 2009 enactment of the Shepard-Byrd hate crime law, the first hate crime law to cover sexual orientation, gender identity and disability. As new legislative initiatives emerge, the course will incorporate any relevant changes to existing federal and Massachusetts laws.\n\nThe course will also explore the federal enforcement effort of these criminal laws with an eye towards the role played by the Criminal Section of the Department of Justices Civil Rights Division where both Instructors worked. In particular, there will be a focus on the implementation of the policy of successive federal prosecutions to vindicate rights after failed state prosecutions, such as the landmark cases of the beating of Rodney King and the killing of Vincent Chin. It will also examine more contemporary direct federal prosecutions initiated after the racially-biased killings at the AME Church in Charleston, S.C. and in Charlottesville, VA. Besides the Instructors' personal involvement in some of these cases, other guest speakers with experience in criminal civil rights enforcement are expected.\n\nStudents will also be asked to participate in mock trial openings and closings in cases which highlight the issues of proof endemic to these types of prosecutions."

Topics will include free speech and religious rights in prison, the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishments, the prison disciplinary process, solitary and supermax confinement, felon disenfranchisement, prisoner access to the courts, and race, gender, & LGBTQ discrimination in prison. We'll also look at Congress's efforts to regulate both prison and litigation brought by prisoners, examining the Prison Litigation Reform Act and the application of the Americans with Disabilities Act within prisons and jails. Finally, we'll examine constitutional remedies, studying the law of injunctive relief in constitutional cases brought by incarcerated individuals, and also some of the issues raised by damages actions.

This will be a pass/fail course limited to amaximum of four students (two teams of two students). To complete all the work listed below,students will be required to dedicate a minimum of 127.5 hours, thus earning 3academic credits, under the supervision of Prof. Van Dyke. Because there is noofficial seminar component, this course will not count for experientiallearning credit pursuant to ABA standard 304. Students will draft and finalizeat least two motions, each of which will be above 10 pages in length. Students will also lead a class discussion inwhich they will present the results of their research to the team. This course is designed to help returning mock trial teammembers take their trial advocacy to the next level. It will involve responsibilities above andbeyond the already-rigorous training schedule, comprised of 40+ hours ofexperiential learning. Applying thefederal rules of evidence, and federal caselaw, students in this class willdraft motions in limine on several of the major evidentiary issuesimplicated by the case problem used at the mock trial competition.The case problem alternates from year to yearbetween a criminal and civil case.Giventhat the students will have to try the case from both sides, they will be taskedwith drafting motions, seeking to admit or exclude evidence, from each of thosevantage points. This course adds an element of verisimilitude to the mocktrial process. The competition itself doesnot allow for the submission and argument of substantive written motions in limine. Nevertheless, it does require students tomake objections. The preparation ofthose motions will enable students to prepare for major evidentiary issues andmake more informed objections throughout the course of the trial. Specifically,this exercise will provide opportunities for learning and applying the rules ofevidence; how to make proffers about anticipated evidence; and how to returnto, and draw on, those same arguments throughout the course of the trial inresponse to developments at the trial. Participants in the senior mock trial team will improve theprospects of the team. First, they willhelp to create a culture in which the team welcomes back returningparticipants. This has been a recipe forsuccess for many other mock trial teams in our region. Second, by sharing their research with otherteam members, and modeling how to incorporate it into objections throughout thecourse of the trial, students in this course will help to improve theperformance of the team. Given thatthere are few in limine arguments at the competition, students will haveto make arguments on their feet at (constructive) side bars. They will be scored, in part, on how theycraft and pursue those objections. Forthis reason, the work done by the students in this course, which enables theteam to cite federal case law and make more sophisticated arguments, willimprove the teams prospects."

        "course_description": "This seminar will examine the evolving relationship between shareholders and public companies in the United States. Whereas individuals once held the majority of public shares, today institutional investors \"including hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and foundations\" hold over two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the thousand largest U.S. public companies. This seminar will examine the preferences, incentives, and constraints of different investors, and the various forms of shareholder activism that have emerged in recent years. Students will assess shareholder efforts and corporate responses on issues such as proxy access, executive compensation, corporate social responsibility, political spending, and board diversity, among others. Finally, students will consider how increasing shareholder sophistication affects traditional theories of the corporation, the role of retail investors, and regulatory approaches to corporate governance."

        "course_description": "Business organizations and their directors/executives often face a complex, onerous, and global regulatory landscape, particularly for public companies and businesses operating in financial services, health care, consumer products, and other highly-regulated industries. As numerous corporate scandals have illustrated, the risk of fraud or regulatory breach can lead to civil and criminal liability, heavy sanctions, and significant reputational damage to companies and individuals. Against this backdrop, compliance has emerged as the growing, dynamic practice of identifying and mitigating legal risks through prevention, detection, and remediation. Students will learn the history and legal underpinnings of corporate governance, compliance, and risk management standards  particularly as applied to public companies and regulated financial services firms. Topics will include fiduciary duties; the roles and interactions of board directors, executives, lawyers, compliance officers, auditors, regulators, and enforcers; compliance program effectiveness; internal investigations; corporate and individual liability; and ethics considerations. Students will also gain practical experience through case studies on high-profile compliance and risk management failures."

        "course_description": "The laws relating to whistleblowing have evolved dramatically in the last twenty years.  Additionally, whistleblowers in both the private and public sector have increasingly played a more prominent role in influencing social reform and public policy.  The courts, legislatures, and government agencies charged with enforcing whistleblower laws have wrestled with the degree to which whistleblowers should be protected from retaliation and under what circumstances they should be incentivized to come forward by the prospect of a monetary award.  In the private sector, courts remain divided over the proper balance between whistleblower protection and enforcement of legitimate corporate business interests such as the protection of confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets.  In the public sector, challenges abound to balance to competing interests in disclosing alleged wrongdoing while protecting national security.  In addition to examining the dramatic evolution of the laws and social policies relating to whistleblowing, this course will also examine the many ethical issues presented such as when and under what circumstances can an attorney present as a whistleblower.  Finally, this course will examine best practices from a corporate compliance perspective to foster transparency and to effectively investigate whistleblower claims as they arise."

Family law is about power: power inside intimate relationships and the power of the state over intimate relationships. Laws codify certain family structures; these structures, in turn, tell us much about societys values, about who we notice and who we privilege.

The Inter-American System for the protection of human rights (IASHR) is the regional system responsible for monitoring, promoting, and protecting human rights in the countries that are members of the Organization of American States (OAS). Currently, it is one of the strongest regional human rights protection systems in the world. This clinic will include two components. (1) The practicum will provide students with practical experiences in advocacy for the promotion of international protection of human rights through amicus briefs before the IACtHR; drafting of legal reports, protocol proposals, and hearings before the IACHR; and the possibility of submissions to other human rights tribunals around the world. (2) The accompanying seminar will provide an overview on the study of the IASHR, including its normative framework, mechanisms, rights protected and its principal entities. Possible practicum fieldwork at the IACHR (Washington DC) or the IACtHR (San Jos, Costa Rica) during spring break. Previous course work in International Law, International Human Rights, and/or International Legal Research is not required, but may provide an enriched perspective."

Students in teams will help prepare lifers for their parole release hearings and will represent them at the hearings. Representation entails learning about the clients life before the underlying crime, the facts of the underlying crime, and the clients institutional history contained in Department of Correction and Parole Board records. Until Covid-19 risks abate, students will conduct interviews with clients via Zoom, email, and postal correspondence rather than by visiting the prison in person. Students will prepare a memorandum in support of parole, including a re-entry plan (with the help of social work students); and prepare the client and support witnesses to testify at the hearing. The Parole Board conducts all hearings virtually during the pandemic. Students will appear virtually at the Lifer Parole Hearing with the client and will deliver an opening statement and closing argument.\n\nUnder the Massachusetts Criminal Justice Reform Act, prisoners serving state sentences at the Massachusetts Department of Correction who are suffering from terminal illnesses or from irreversible physical or cognitive incapacitation may be eligible for medical release (\"compassionate release\"). Whenever such cases are referred to the Clinic, students will help prepare a petition for release and an accompanying medical parole plan with the assistance of social work students and nursing students. Students will first advocate with the Department of Correction for release. If not successful, appeal can be taken to the Superior Court. Students will learn about the clients underlying crime, the clients institutional record, the clients physical, medical, mental health condition and the clients risk to re-offend in light of the client's condition."

In seminar and supervision, students will be encouraged to think critically about the role of the lawyer, client, and community in these different models and the intersection of worker and immigrant rights and racial justice. On the litigation side, representative matters may include lawsuits on behalf of workers, immigrants, and incarcerated individuals who have experienced various forms of exploitation including wage theft, discrimination, and mistreatment. On the community advocacy side, the clinic provides legal, policy and other technical assistance to organizational clients that may include worker centers, local unions, or immigrant advocacy groups, in support of their legislative priorities or other organizing campaigns. Student Attorneys should plan to spend approximately 20-25 hours/week on clinic work and will be handling all phases of their client matters with the close supervision and guidance of the clinic director."

Advocacy may occur in a variety of legal areas including education (such as advocacy to secure appropriate special education services), public benefits (such as appealing a denial of essential benefits), or housing (such as advocacy to remediate poor housing conditions resulting in asthma or lead poisoning). Through interdisciplinary casework, close supervision, and weekly seminars students learn to engage in culturally humble client advocacy, reflecting on the structures and systems that intersect each case and developing a variety of advocacy skills while providing critical representation in an area of substantial community need."

We will identify practices which nurture and strengthen the inner life and the connection between the inner life and well-being of lawyers and the quality of legal practice. To transform the justice system through restorative justice, future lawyers must be committed to transforming themselves and their way of being in the world. We will explore the roots of restorative justice, contemporary examples of its application in post-conflict settings in the US and the world, and examine its utility in addressing the pressing mass incarceration crisis, the current penal system and mode of punishment in the US. We will practice and apply Critical Race and Systems Theories to sharpen the students' ability to assess themselves, and their future clients, through a systems lens and to examine the impact of racism, sexism, gender discrimination and other systems of oppression on behavior and on the justice system.

While it is rare that such explicit practices are alleged, the reality of the school to prison pipeline is well documented. However, the realities of systemic practices & policies that have fueled what Marian Write Edleman & others have characterized as the cradle to prison pipeline are now being scrutinized. The BBA's Cradle to Prison Pipeline Committee describes the process as the mechanism by which disparities in a wide range of arenas--including economic, health care, mental health, housing, child welfare & juvenile justice factors--\"funnel\" people of color, the poor, the LGBTQ+ community, & youth with disabilities into the system of mass incarceration. \"Unpacking\" this phenomena entails examining critical issues of race, class, geographical & educational segregation & implicates consideration of the larger frames that affect families in & out of courtrooms. As Jill Lepore notes in Baby Doe: A Political Tragedy, between 2010-12, 72% of the youth committed to the MA DYS had been involved with DCF & over half of that number has been the subject of abuse & neglect petitions. In exploring this terrain this course will consider the evolution of child welfare & juvenile justice systems, de facto v. de jure segregation & to encourage students to think about ways to chart a different course."

Therefore global cancer control strategies must focus on primary and secondary prevention of cancer as the most effective response to these public health challenges. The first step in cancer prevention is to identify the causes of human cancer and to determine what works in cancer prevention.\n\nThe aim of the course is to provide the student with the knowledge and skills to identify relevant cancer types, their established and suspected risk factors and established measures of primary and secondary prevention (screening) of cancer, globally, regionally, and nationally. Within and between countries the poor are often more affected by cancer, therefore cancer control must also aim to reduce the social inequalities in cancer."

In recent years, few issues have attracted more controversy and political rancor than matters of womens health. Some issues may seem intractable due to conflicting but sincerely held beliefs rooted in religion, ethics and morality. Other matters are more clear-cut. For many women, this sweeping and intensifying political discord has compromised their health status, and curtailed their social and economic resources along with their legal rights.Relying on their complementary expertise in social work and law, Prof. Hawkins and Prof. Chirba will guide students in understanding the importance of interdisciplinary study when confronting problems of individual and public health, particularly when it comes to womens health. Thus, students will learn to understand the ways in which social, cultural, economic, political and legal forces impede the health status of women across the life course, and more specifically, hamper womens access to health care that is appropriate, adequate and affordable. Students will then use their interdisciplinary training to evaluate how to develop sound social and economic policies to mitigate gaps across the healthcare continuum, and how to use law to implement such measures to protect women regardless of age, race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status."

Student Attorneys handle all phases of their clients cases, from client interviewing through case planning, fact investigation, discovery, client counseling, negotiation, and courtroom advocacy. Through practice and confronting a series of inevitable firsts; students rapidly develop both confidence and competence as lawyers.\n\nHousing Justice is geared toward prevention of homelessness, primarily through eviction defense and public housing advocacy. The case docket also includes affirmative civil cases against notoriously unscrupulous landlords to correct deplorable housing conditions, halt discriminatory practices, and protect tenants from other forms of mistreatment. \n\nThe mixture of housing matters students handle enriches their development in many ways. Students will understand the common legal, factual and ethics patterns that emerge from differenttypes of litigation matters. Courts and administrative agencies before which students appear provide informative contrast. Cases have different paces and cadences. Clients have distinctly different interests and needs. This variety contributes immeasurably to a beginning lawyers professional growth.\n\nClinical faculty provide extensive supervision, assistance and training through every stage of students work on cases, from preparation for tasks and events through retrospective reflection. Student Attorneys receive thorough feedback on all aspects of their work to help them build core lawyering skills, learn from their experiences, and mature professionally. Informal feedback is part of each participants daily experience. Formal feedback is given both at mid-semester and end of term.\n\nStudent Attorneys meet in a weekly seminar to examine their work closely. Practical, strategic, legal, ethical and interpersonal tensions are the focus of discussion aimed at deriving deepened understanding of the joys and challenges of civil litigation practice."

To meet the upper-level writing requirement, after learning the various topics and drafting techniques, students will draft various contracts from scratch that together meet the 30-page minimum. That will be the primary component of the grading, and there will also be a significant class participation portion of the grade."

Some of the legal concepts may have been introduced in other courses, but the emphasis in ALC is on a review of the most highly tested legal concepts from the MBE subjects through exercises specifically designed and scaffolded to help students develop the strategic mindset essential for success on the multiple choice portion of the bar examination.The ALC courses are offered in the fall and the spring semesters and are reserved for 3Ls. Each course focuses on a different set of MBE subjects and course materials for both courses include access to an online early bar preparation portal. While the materials are similar to the materials that students will use when they are studying for the bar examination after graduation, they contain additional exercises to help students break down the mental process necessary to effectively answer multiple choice questions in a high stakes testing environment. Students have access to substantive outlines, lecture handouts, video lectures, and MBE questions. The course is NOT a substitute for a summer bar prep course, but rather is an opportunity to develop skills essential for success with live professor feedback and at a pace not available during the intense 10 week bar study period."

Distressed and rural labor marketslabor markets in rural areas and deindustrialized cities, suburbs, and towns that have suffered declining growth or contractionare characterized by high labor market concentration levels, scarce employment, and low levels of labor market regulation that entrench employer power. These characteristics present unique legal and regulatory challenges that this seminar will explore. The course materials and seminar discussions will concentrate on the limitations of current law and labor market regulation in these markets and consider a suite of legal and policy solutions to combatting employer power and strengthening worker power as well asestablishing work as a means of accessing economic opportunity in the context of geographic inequality. In analyzing the limitations of current legal protections, the seminar will concentrate both on substantive rights and obligations imposed by current law as well as the role and ability of labor market institutions governmental agencies, unions, corporate forms, non-profits, and civil society organizationsin ensuring or undermining those rights and obligations."

The course will illustrate the difficult legal, political, and practical problems faced by practitioners in these cases. As a result of that journey through the case(s), the students will be taught concepts of extraterritoriality (and its limits); jurisdiction over foreign persons and entities (and its limits);the doctrine of forum non conveniens in the international context; and comity (and its limits).The students will learn the unique challenges and critical issues in filing a U.S. chapter 11 case for a foreign entity. The students will also learn the mechanics of chapter 15 (and its international counterparts) and its critical substantive and procedural components, all of which come into play when seeking recognition of insolvency proceedings in another country. Through the use of case studies, the students will be exposed to how these concepts and issues arise andare dealt with in an actual case, rather than being exposed only to theoretical problems. Using in-class experiential learning opportunities, the students will be placed in the position of the various parties and their counsel, with the attendant need to argue relevant positions and solve the problems it presented. At the end of this course, students should acquire a detailed understanding of how a cross-border case works procedurally and substantively, through various structures; a working knowledge of chapter 15 and cross-border protocols; a thorough understanding of principles of comity, extraterritoriality, personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens as they relate to cross-border insolvency cases; and an understanding of how such cases can handle mass tort, environmental, and other mass-claim contexts."

        "course_description": "The seminar will examine the role of the courts in both enabling and hindering the remarkable social/political/cultural shifts that have made it possible for many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans to participate more fully in our common life while being as open as they choose about who they are, creating for many of us a changed landscape impossible to have imagined a just a few decades ago. The First Amendment will be a primary focus, although the questions posed will inevitably spill over into considerations of the Due Process and Equal Protection provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Our perspective will be critical, recognizing evolving openness in the courts where it appears and at the same time calling out the conscious, unconscious and systemic bias that continues to pervade the law. The plan is to begin with the unlikely emergence of the First Amendment as a friend to LGBT+ folk in the otherwise hostile legal landscape of the Fifties. Then, we will track how, fertilized by the African-American civil rights and feminist movements of the Sixties and early Seventies, the right to speak burgeoned into the right to participate openly incivic venues that were formerly off limits. We will look at how, and to what extent, the role of the state as guardian of gender conformity lost much of its power to impede openness and equality for people who had historically been regarded as simply beyond the pale of community. We will examine the redlines that queer people were forbidden to cross, like the scouts, the military, athletics, parenting and marriage; and the extent to which those lines have eroded or become more rigid.We will assess the blowback, such as the spate of laws forbidding discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in the schools; laws targeting transgender individuals; and the increasing use of the First Amendment to create exemptions to public accommodation laws.Finally, we will think together about the advantages and possible drawbacks of the strategies employed to advance equality for LGBTQ+ folks as these strategies relate to the larger struggle for human liberation and for the fostering of an environment that makes it easier for the planet and its inhabitants to thrive.To help facilitate this discussion, one or more sessions will, if feasible, include practicing attorneys working in this area of the law. There will be final paper in lieu of an examination. Grades will be based on the paper and class participation, including weekly response papers to the material covered in our weekly sessions."

What exactly does the Fourteenth Amendments Equal Protection Clause require of us? And what does our right to vote actually entail? In this course, we will study the meaning of the Reconstruction Constitution and critically reflect on its implications for contemporary legal practice. To do so, we will examine the original historical documents of the public debates surrounding the framing, passage, and ratification of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments. Special focus will be given to the constitutional legacies of the abolitionist, womens rights, and long civil rights movements, as well as the constitutional theories that shape the way we understand our Reconstruction Constitution today."

The subject matter of the disputes will include: commercial transactions, gender bias issues, criminal plea bargaining, family law matters, personal injury cases, and other disciplines. Students will be introduced to the art of negotiating, reading body language and micro-messages, interviewing clients and reaching common ground with adversaries. The work will be critiqued as actual student negotiating sessions are taking place, all in an effort to familiarize students with various techniques, strategies, tactics, persuasive skills, and effective demeanor involved in successful negotiations. Although there will be some lectures, the emphasis of the course is \"learn by doing.\""

        "course_description": "The well documented phenomenon of police violence against African-Americans and other people of color now stands out as one of the most vexing and intractable social justice issues in the United States. Viral videos have shined a light on the pervasive brutality of racialized policing, a problem that once was visible only to the victims and the communities where it occurred. Legal scholars and practitioners have been drawn into the lively public debate about how, under a legal system ostensibly guided by principles of equal justice under the law, such behavior is allowed to continue without consequences for the perpetrators. The question central to this debate is whether the Constitution and established legal procedures provide a sufficient and reliable restraint on racialized police violence against people of color. Some activists, distrustful of a legal system that too often fails to hold police officers accountable for conduct that violates a persons civil and human rights, doubt the vitality of existing legal and policy responses to the issue. In the alternative, they tout remedies that include defunding or abolishing the police altogether. Others, advocating a more moderate approach, insist that by reforming existing law, policy and practices, the problem of police violence can be sufficiently mitigated.\n\nIn this course, the readings and discussion will focus broadly on this debate over the role of the law in combating racialized policing. First, students will consider the extent to which the Fourth Amendment (which defines the rules of engagement for threshold encounters between the police and civilians) and the Equal Protection Clause (which prohibits discrimination based on race) offer viable protections from racialized police violence. For this segment of the course, the class discussion will highlight Terry v. Ohio and Whren v. United States as students consider whether neutral Fourth Amendment principles like reasonable suspicion to justify a stop and frisk may be implicated in the prevalence of racial profiling and other forms of racialized policing. In the second segment of the course, students will explore established accountability measures, including criminal prosecutions under state and federal law, departmental discipline, civil\nrights actions under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and federal consent decrees under 34 U.S.C. 12601, with the goal of understanding the limitations of each as a check on racialized police violence. In the last segment of the course, students will review a sampling of the post-George Floyd proposals for reimagining policing and insuring accountability for wrongful conduct. Here, the discussion will challenge students to critique the broad expanse of ideas emanating from the reform movement, the proposals for defunding the police and the demands for abolition of the police altogether."

Recently, global border regions have taken front and center in discussions of migration and forced migration. Emerging nationalistic sentiments have fostered policies and dynamics to increase surveillance, control, and conflict along border regions. The \"Remain in Mexico'' and Title 42 policies are some examples of how the United States government externalizes its borders and enforces policies that impact peoples' lives at different levels. Furthermore, border regions remain lively, as local and foreign populations interact and try to navigate the unfolding dynamics of human mobility. This course offers the opportunity to understand and analyze different contexts in border regions, as well as the opportunity to interact with students from different disciplinary backgrounds. It also allows students to identify vulnerable populations in these settings, and to reflect on the impact their particular discipline has in understanding and participating in borderland dynamics.This course is a travel course that requires the completion of two on-line modules, participation in two on-line sessions before departure, 8 days of immersion during the Spring Break in the San Diego, U.S.-Tijuana, Mexico region, and one additional session upon return.Participants will need to cover their transportation costs and the course fee.NOTE: The days for the immersion will comprise different sessions and encounters with organizations on the ground. Due to the current pandemic, some sessions may have to be online while either in San Diego or Tijuana. Participants need to have a current passport and required visas to travel."

This course is about acquiring new skills in data analytics as well as the application and synthesis of skills obtained across disciplines to tackle complex problems through a social justice lens. Using a team science approach, interdisciplinary groups of students will develop their own research question, link datasets through geographic identifiers, analyze data using quantitative skills and mixed methods techniques, and generate outputs with impact. Training will be provided on how to produce outputs for and present results to a range of audiences.\n\nThe overarching aim of the course is to provide students with hands-on opportunities to use data analytics to address pressing social problems from interdisciplinary perspectives. A recurring theme will be on the ethical implications of big data and how to design research questions that expose and mitigate social inequities. \n\nPrerequisites: At least one semester, but preferably one year, of graduate-level statistics, with experience in regression analysis. Stata statistical software will be used in the course."

Target sponsors include, but are not limited to, federal funding agencies (e.g., National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control) and research foundations (e.g., Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Gates Foundation). Through the course sequence, the grant writing process and the sections of a research grant application will be reviewed. Rigorous research methods, innovative science, and compelling communication strategies will be emphasized throughout. All course assignments will focus on elements of the final deliverable, which is a 6-10 page grant application for a designated sponsor. Students are strongly encouraged to submit their application by the end of the semester or the following summer. In many instances, the resulting deliverable could also form the basis of a dissertation proposal. The course is co-taught by faculty in the School of Social Work and the Connell School of Nursing to foster a strong interdisciplinary perspective in research and grant writing."

From these appropriations emerge commitments to specific charisms and pedagogical practices. It is imperative that Catholic educational efforts continue to affirm the spiritual legacies that have sustained schools, missions, and parochial programs throughout history. In this course we read some foundational texts of major schools of spirituality and explore how they have inspired life-giving philosophies of Catholic education. The guiding principle throughout the course is that a good philosophy of Catholic education and catechesis is always sustained by a deep spirituality."

Coursework features selected readings, workshops, presentations, and projects to be completed both individually and in small groups.

We do this from a socialcultural perspective, exploring language learning as embedded in sociohistorically situated activities. We develop and account of how learning language is also learning culture. Second, we study how these processes vary across cultural contexts. Because language learning is woven into social and historical contexts, processes of language learning and schooling vary around the world. The course develops several case studies from different areas of the globe in order to illustrate how language learning and schooling can intersect in different ways."

Previous models of learning focused on knowledge as a collection of facts within curriculum and learning environments helping individuals obtain those facts. However, today technology can enable all individuals to quickly obtain facts. Instead, expertise requires deep knowledge in which ideas are applied across multiple contexts in particular contexts with people and tools. These shifts in knowledge as well as technological advances have significant implications for how we design curriculum and other learning environments. In this course, we will examine different learning environments as well as various aspects within those environments. For example, we will examine curriculum to evaluate the scaffolds to support student learning, analyze digital learning environments for professional development to support teacher learning and critique video of classroom discourse to examine student interactions and community development. In this course, we will consider the environment both as conceptualized by its designers (the design) and as it is experienced by participants as learning interactions unfold in particular settings (the enactment) to evaluate the effectiveness of those learning environments."

Students will apply various organizational theories in order to understand group- and system-level patterns in how groups get things done (e.g., structures and resources, symbols and values, power and politics). Ultimately, students leave the course better able to plan and evaluate school improvement through the lenses of organizational theory."

We study specific topics in international law relevant to global companies, including efforts to establish uniform rules for international contracting, methods for resolving international commercial disputes, cross-border investment protections and trade agreements, and corruption. Finally, we take an in-depth look at real world applications of international legal principles using case studies from around the world. Case topics will range from the legal fallout from industrial disasters to the consequences of bribing foreign officials to the regulation of international sports. By the end of the semester, students will be able to recognize legal problems in the context of global business and will feel comfortable applying appropriate principles of international and national law to move towards a solution.

After reviewing the historical context - how did we get here - this course will delve into the current structure of the healthcare services industry and how the legal system has helped shape that structure. Thematically, we will examine equity in access to care, industry efficiency, and quality of care. Across these themes, where has the market failed, and what have legal system players and other market constituents done to address the failures? Topics will include the advent and growth of managed care; provider organization structures; Affordable Care Act and health care reform efforts and concepts; the triple aim of improved patient experience and much more."

We put specific emphasis on discussing international financial themes that currently occupy policymakers, practitioners, and academics in a global \"high inflation, low interest rate regime\", in the context of longer-run historical markets data. We also analyze a wide range of past \"shocks\" and \"crises\" in global macro and finance over time,to learn how to evaluate risks.\nAmong other issues, we will focus on the following current debates:1914, 1981 - and 2022? Major turning points in assetmarkets.Long-run financial crisis patterns and interventions.Historical shifts in the global reserve currency.Long-run trends in inequality, globalization, and wealth distribution."

Possible topics include earnings and price momentum, market anomalies, tactical asset allocation, under-reaction to news, security complexity and obfuscation, and socially responsible investing. Practical implications for portfolio management are developed and emphasis will be placed on data-driven analysis of financial markets.\nThe course has 3 major goals. The first will be to take the view of a professional money manager to utilize knowledge of investor behavior to understand market movements and (hopefully) profit from opportunities that are available. The second will be to understand how data is used to uncover such opportunities. The third is to understand how individuals make decisions in order to make better personal investment decisions and avoid commonly exhibited biases when making financial decisions.\nAchieving these goals will require learning some theories, facts and statistical tools. The theories will allow for a common language in the discussion of returns and will include risk-based asset pricing, present value relations and cognitive psychology. The facts relate to risk and return, value vs. growth, momentum, market frictions and trading costs. Support for both of these will come from the data for which we will need the tools of portfolio analysis, multifactor models and forecasting regressions."

We will survey recent research on possible mispricing in these markets, investor behavior, the predictability of security returns, and the practical limits to arbitrage. Possible topics include earnings and price momentum, market anomalies, tactical asset allocation, under-reaction to news, security complexity and obfuscation, and socially responsible investing. Practical implications for portfolio management are developed and emphasis will be placed on data-driven analysis of financial markets.\nThe course has 3 major goals. The first will be to take the view of a professional money manager to utilize knowledge of investor behavior to understand market movements and (hopefully) profit from opportunities that are available. The second will be to understand how data is used to uncover such opportunities. The third is to understand how individuals make decisions in order to make better personal investment decisions and avoid commonly exhibited biases when making financial decisions.\nAchieving these goals will require learning some theories, facts and statistical tools. The theories will allow for a common language in the discussion of returns and will include risk-based asset pricing, present value relations and cognitive psychology. The facts relate to risk and return, value vs. growth, momentum, market frictions and trading costs. Support for both of these will come from the data for which we will need the tools of portfolio analysis, multifactor models and forecasting regressions.\nSTEM-designated"

        "course_description": "In this comprehensive exploration, we will immerse ourselves in the growing domain of positive organizational scholarship (POS) and positive psychology, equipping students with research knowledge and practical skills to foster individual and collective flourishing in work settings. Flourishing is a multidimensional concept that captures the optimal state of functioning in individuals, groups, and organizations. It encompasses thriving, engagement, health, growth, creativity, and other markers of positive deviance. Throughout the course, we will delve into the core topics and foundational theories of positive psychology and POS to understand how human flourishing can be nurtured and sustained.Our journey will begin by understanding the historical roots of positive psychology, which emerged as a paradigm shift, challenging traditional psychology to explore the positive aspects of life and build on human strengths and capacities. We will also examine how flourishing extends beyond merely curing pathology, emphasizing the need to unlock and capitalize on potential resources at various levels, from individuals to teams, communities, and institutions. We will unravel the science of habit formation and how positive habits relate to flourishing. We study the science of happiness and general well-being, and explore how to identify and leverage individual strengths to foster personal growth and resilience. We will also build an understanding of research showing the power positive emotions have to shape well-being and performance. We will furthermore study positive Interventions - exploring evidence-based practices to cultivate flourishing in personal and professional contexts and strategies for building thriving workplaces that unleash the best in people. While we embrace the transformative potential of positivity, we also acknowledge the complexities and potential dark sides of this approach. We will critically discuss the challenges of maintaining a positive pathway, aiming for a nuanced understanding of positive psychology and its application in organizations.Our pedagogy will go beyond traditional lectures, actively involving you in individual and group experiential exercises, reflections, and discussions. Moreover, this course places emphasis on research exploration, and includes assignments asking you to design and conduct a research project to examine the effects of positive interventions. By the end of this course, you will have gained valuable insights into cultivating personal well-being and creating positive change within groups and organizations. Together, we will uncover the keys to unlocking human potential and fostering thriving - personally, professionally, in teams, and in organizations."

On the surface, those with what appears to be a natural drive to succeed seem to become more affluent. That is to say, some people appear to embrace hustle culture, or the idea that any time spent not making money is wasted time, while others are drawn toward a trend identified around 2021 as quiet quitting, that is to say, they refuse to devote more time and energy to their work than is absolutely necessary to avoid losing their jobs. Why is this apparent lack of ambition and motivation so prevalent? Can we blame mere laziness? This question will be answered with a resounding no. Rather, this class will show that there are indeed systematic measures in place that cause some to not appear as motivated as others. In order to work through this answer, this class will look at alienation and capitalism. This course will address the effects of systemic racism, automation and AI, environmental concerns, generational trends, and the COVID-19 pandemic on ones ambition to succeed in the workforce.

After understanding how firms report on ESG, we will examine how stakeholders use this information, considering questions such as how to assess the reliability of these disclosures (e.g. is this just \"greenwashing\"), how these disclosures relate to commercial ESG ratings, and how these disclosures tie to the firms' sustainability strategies (e.g. tying executive compensation to ESG metrics).

Long before the exacerbations of a global pandemic, polarization was increasing, trust was plummeting, deaths of despair were on the rise, civic participation was down, and we heard talk of a growing epidemic of loneliness. All this amidst a world-historical expansion of wealth, and falling rates of crime. What is going on? This course begins with the suspicion that Americanbusiness plays a central, underappreciated role in the ongoing evolution of our social fabric. It aims to ask: how do the business community's deep assumptions, values and practices shape our sense of ourselves and each other? Our senses of safety and precarity? Our inclinations to creativity and conformity? This course will examine key documents from management theory, social science, philosophy and literature to explore some ways that American commerce and American culture shape one another, and how this relationship can be brought into healthier alignment."

The course will primarily focus on the ways that motivation and emotion contribute to this process. For example, students will examine the motivations that lead individuals to adopt particular achievement goals (e.g., the goal of getting a good grade), the ways in which these goals impact learners behaviors, and the impact of these behaviors on important outcomes (e.g., grades and well-being).\nStudents in the course will also examine different types of emotions (e.g.,curiosity, boredom, frustration, etc.) that learners experience when pursuing their academic goals and the ways in which these emotions can support or hinder their achievement of these goals. In addition to examining motivation and emotion as factors shape learners' achievement and self-regulation, the course will explore some of the ways in which motivation and emotion can themselves be regulated. For example, students will learn about the kinds of strategies that individuals use to bolster their motivation when they feel like quitting or to calm themselves down when they are feeling anxious. Although the course will explore some of the ways that motivation, emotion, and self-regulation develop, its main focuswill be on how adolescents and young adults pursue their learning goals."

Building empathy, mutual respect, and community both within and outside the classroom will be central concerns."

The course will focus on how to manage a caseload in an integrated care setting (e.g., maintaining open access, triage as necessary, determining who could benefit from targeted treatment) as well as how to conceptualize cases, formulate treatment plans, provide documentation appropriate for the setting and crisis intervention strategies. Additionally, we will discuss the importance of collaboration and information sharing with other team members, as well as how to provide consent for this communication and the potential ethical issues that can arise. We will discuss the nuanced role that an IBH clinician has in managing chronic disease, engaging health promotion, and assessing and treating special populations. Lastly, the role of an IBH practitioner extends beyond intervention in the clinic (e.g. telehealth), and thus we will also learn the importance of interdisciplinary consultation and referral as well as strategies for outreach to community resources and settings in order to support both clinic and patient in whole person health."

As such it is imperative for mental health counselors to understand the unique circumstances of urban life and how they impact lifespan development and mental wellbeing. This course will use the lenses of ecological, decolonial and liberation psychology theory to critically examine sources of mental distress, mental wellness as well as counseling approaches used to enhance the lives of urban dwellers. Lecture, reflective writing practices, and group discussions emphasizing critical consciousness will be used to foster learning. Moreover, students will engage in collaborative group work to learn the role of social justice advocacy in addressing structural problems impacting mental health outcomes."

Students and their cohort will practice the art of asking questions of themselves and each other as part of an ongoing leadership journey. The holistic approach to leadership development in this course focuses on how cura apostolica (care for the work) is integrally related to the better-known idea of cura personalis (care for the whole person). The course focuses on executive leadership development that involves but goes beyond individuals to encompass the whole community that belongs to each other. The course invites doctoral students into communities to serve with and for others to use their talents to address the worlds greatest needs."

While interacting with and reading work by experts in the field, we will discuss both local and global settings, exploring how language learning affects heritage language revitalization, bilingualism, indigenous communities, and others. We will discuss how language learning is never a neutral process, but instead happens in social contexts and inevitably shapes identities. We will learn how to facilitate language learning in ways that promote justice, increase empathy, and meet the needs of diverse students. Throughout, we will take a global perspective and consider language learning from multiple points of view."

These purposes have frequently had adverse effects on the discipline's developmental trajectory, contributing to a narrowing of its epistemological and methodological commitments. Contemporary psychology suffers the ongoing effects of the narrowing, oftern deploying methods (e.g., natural scientific paradigms) that are ill-suited to its subject-human persons. The emerging field of psychological humanities seeks to restore to psychology a more pluralistic means of understanding of humanity- methodologically and theoretically. This is being accomplished through a revitalization of the connection between social scientific exploration with the scholarship and ideas associated with the humanitites. In this course, students will be exposed to a survey of topics, issues, and traditions associated with the converstaions currently taking place in the psychological humanities. These include phenomenology, critical psychology, indigenous psychologies, existentialism, literary critique, hermeneutics, psychoanalysis, global psychology, and social constructionism, all deployed to enlarge psychology's capacity to dialogue across ideas and methods for the purpose of asking the question of what it means to be human."

Through examination of paradigmatic texts and visits from Lynch faculty members describing their own work, we consider the affordances of major traditions of educational inquiry. Working toward a formal proposal for a scholarly investigation, artistic creation, or public action, students are supported to articulate, deepen, and refine their own driving questions about educational concepts, relationships, practices, institutions, and aims. (Students who take EDUC 4050 in their junior year may wish to develop the work itself as a senior project.)"

The formative frame centers questions of meaning; anthropology studies how human beings create, inhabit, and transform it. Formation is inevitably value-laden; anthropology seeks to unpack the rich variety of lived responses to the question of what matters and why. The formative frame decenters schools; the ethnographic ideal impels us to enter every setting-from courtrooms to pickle ball courts-alive to the possibility that here too we can bear witness to human beings exploring and enacting their many-sided natures. FORM8830 is doctoral level introduction to the field of anthropology and its affordances for the study of formative experience. By reading classic and comtemporary texts, listening to more informal conversations on Podcasts and YouTube videos, and pursuing their own questions in anthopological terms, students will learn about the tools, people, debates, and ideals that define this rich tradition of inquiry. Required for Ph.D. students in Formative Education; other doctoral students with a special interest in the topic may contact the instructor for permission."

Thisseminar, sponsored by the Center for Human Rights and International Justice, provides a rare space to examine human rights and international justice from interdisciplinary and transnational theoretical perspectives and through praxis. It brings together faculty affiliated with the Center, students from across the university, visiting scholars, and guest speakers to examine complexities and seeming contradictions vis-a-vis human rights and justice. The spring 2024seminarwill begin with an overview and brief historical review of human rights as understood in the West, drawing on both dominant discourses as well as less well-known histories from marginalized communities. We will then explore a series of complexities for those seeking to engage in human rights scholarship, advocacy, and activism. We seek to engage critically with human rights discourse and actions including the advocacy and activism of those on the move within and across borders as well as those seeking redress through transitional justice in the wake of both contemporary and historical gross violations of human rights as they intersect with violence and exploitation due to intersectional circulations of power vis--vis gender, culture/ethnicity, race, social class, and othercategorizations or identities. We will also explore emergent decolonization practices including specific challenges from diverse communities of the global South who frame human rights and responsibilities within their Indigenous practices and cosmovisions, in ways that contest Northern epistemologies, understandings, and praxis.The Center invites applications from students enrolled in a graduate or professional degree in any of Boston College's divisions. Undergraduate seniors will be considered, space permitting.\nRegistration by permission only. Apply with a 1-2 statement of interest. Priority application deadlineNovember 8; secondary deadline November 22. More info & apply at::www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/centers/chrij/academics/seminar.html"

The spring 2024seminarwill begin with an overview and brief historical review of human rights as understood in the West, drawing on both dominant discourses as well as less well-known histories from marginalized communities. We will then explore a series of complexities for those seeking to engage in human rights scholarship, advocacy, and activism. We seek to engage critically with human rights discourse and actions including the advocacy and activism of those on the move within and across borders as well as those seeking redress through transitional justice in the wake of both contemporary and historical gross violations of human rights as they intersect with violence and exploitation due to intersectional circulations of power vis--vis gender, culture/ethnicity, race, social class, and othercategorizations or identities. We will also explore emergent decolonization practices including specific challenges from diverse communities of the global South who frame human rights and responsibilities within their Indigenous practices and cosmovisions, in ways that contest Northern epistemologies, understandings, and praxis.The Center invites applications from students enrolled in a graduate or professional degree in any of Boston College's divisions.

The seminar challenges students to develop skills as practitioner-scholars in addressing a complex problem of practice in higher education as they complete their projects.The Executive Ed.D. in Higher Education is designed with a curriculum designed to developacademic leaders capable of navigating an era of rapid change in higher education. This emphasis influences the nature of the program's culminating productthe Executive Doctoral Dossier (EDD)which is designed to be valuable for executive-level leaders and the organizations they serve now and in the future. The dossier aligns with the principles of the Carnegie Project on the Education Doctorate (CPED) as a a scholarly project that demonstrates a synthesis of the students abilities, lays the groundwork for future practice scholarship, and demonstrates mastery of ability to frame and critically inquire into a significant educational problem of practice. It also aligns with BCs commitment to whole-person education that invites the whole person  and involves our whole community  to see leading and learning as two sides of the same transformative coin. In the Executive Doctoral Dossier project, students address a real-world problem of practice (PoP).They focus on significant, high-leverage questions centered on real-world issues, leadershipchallenges, and complex problems faced by leaders and organizations. They integrate academic (e.g.,empirical research, data, and frameworks) and practice-based (e.g., policy reports, etc.) and use multiple data sources in an applied data-driven project. The project emphasizes research-based, data-informed insights and their implications for higher education institutions, policies, and practices. It is designed to advance professional knowledge and increase their impact as an executive-level leader in an era of rapid change. It invites doctoral students into communities to serve with and for othersto use their talents to address critical issues in higher education."

Technologies of Self and Society    is an interdisciplinary exploration of questions at once perennial and pressing: Are our new technologies vastly different from the technological advances that have always defined humanity's tool-using nature, or have we lost touch with important aspects of ourselves in this instrumental and technical age? How do our tools turn around and use us? What is the impact of social media on human formation? What are its implications for democracy? How do the newest technologies challenge or alter our understanding of human personhood? Are AI tools well-described as intelligent? If so, what makes this intelligence artificial? What types of human judgment are we currently offloading to algorithms, and how does this compare to the ways we have always delegated judgment to experts, groups, and traditions? Through experiential learning opportunities and discussion of classic and contemporary texts (including literature and film), we will explore how technology mediates our relationships to ourselves, each other, and the world."

Through examination of paradigmatic texts and visits from Lynch faculty members describing their own work, we consider the affordances of major traditions of educational inquiry. Working toward a formal proposal for a scholarly investigation, artistic creation, or public action, students are supported to articulate, deepen, and refine their own driving questions about educational concepts, relationships, practices, institutions, and aims.

This doctoral course aims to foster a deeper understanding of pivotal moments in the evolution of formative education while nurturing students' skills in conducting historiographical research. It offers a dual invitation: firstly, to explore and examine the philological semantics of formative education, tracing its evolution through historical ideas and practices; secondly, to engage graduate students and researchers in historiographical research within this field. Throughout the course, students will encounter significant instances of formative education, as viewed through the lens of key historiographical works. They will be prompted to reflect on the concepts and models of formative education described in these writings, as well as the methodological and hermeneutical approaches employed to understand, explain, and interpret these concepts and models. In addition to preparing the weekly assigned readings for discussion, students will be tasked with finding and reading supplementary scholarly materials, such as articles, chapters, books, or papers, that deepen their comprehension of the primary reading. The instructor will initially provide a selection of potential supporting readings, gradually encouraging students to explore the broader literature on the weekly topic. FORM 8820 is required for Ph.D. students in Formative Education. Other doctoral students with a special interest in the topic may contact the instructor for permission to take the course."

We will study tools such as participant observation, interviewing, fieldnotes, and digital ethnography, while practicing these skills in a mini-ethnographic project conducted during the semester. Finally, we will grapple with the challenge of analyzing the often complex and variegated data produced through ethnographic research, learning how to capture our observations and analyses in writing."

The spring 2024seminarwill begin with an overview and brief historical review of human rights as understood in the West, drawing on both dominant discourses as well as less well-known histories from marginalized communities. We will then explore a series of complexities for those seeking to engage in human rights scholarship, advocacy, and activism. We seek to engage critically with human rights discourse and actions including the advocacy and activism of those on the move within and across borders as well as those seeking redress through transitional justice in the wake of both contemporary and historical gross violations of human rights as they intersect with violence and exploitation due to intersectional circulations of power vis--vis gender, culture/ethnicity, race, social class, and othercategorizations or identities. We will also explore emergent decolonization practices including specific challenges from diverse communities of the global South who frame human rights and responsibilities within their Indigenous practices and cosmovisions, in ways that contest Northern epistemologies, understandings, and praxis.The Center invites applications from students enrolled in a graduate or professional degree in any of Boston College's divisions.

Whereas conventional evaluation draws on social science methods to evaluate discrete policies and programs, systemic approaches to evaluation draw on theory and methods from the systems and complexity sciences to support change or transformation in the face of complex issues and large-scale systems. Focal topics covered include differing rationales for and resistance to systemic change; ways to bring diverse actors and perspectives together; five phases of a systemic change process (i.e., shared vision, systems mapping, leverage points, navigating futures, and learning and adapting); and ways to evaluate the value and impact of a systemic change effort. Course materials span multiple fields (e.g., health, international development, sustainability, education), bridge academic scholarship and practical guidance, and incorporate popular media. By the end of the course, students will develop knowledge of systems and evaluation concepts and methods and apply new skills and experiences to create an original proposal to design and evaluate a systemic change initiative. Additionally, the interdisciplinary and hands-on classroom environment and peer review exercises provide opportunities to build community and shared learning.This course is useful for students seeking careers in research/evaluation or leadership/management whether in government, philanthropy, non-profits, or international organizations. Prerequisites include one or more courses in (a) research or evaluation methodology (b) an applied field or problem area within a field (e.g., educational inequality, restorative justice, elder care); and (c) professional or personal experience with societal systems in need of change (e.g., activism, leadership, teaching)."

Too often, decisions are made based solely on numbers, shareholder value or some other metric of business, often without reflection.

Using a Thomistic ethical system and Ignatian discernment and values as our guide, this course will explore strategies and options for integrating virtue into leadership decision-making. Thomistic ethics is to be given primacy of place because it is universally applicable, and is based upon a unified, coherent understanding of the nature of humanity. It is thoroughly grounded in the objective order of things. Thomistic ethics is an eminent expression of philosophical realism. Thomistic ethics is guided every step of the way by the assumption that just as human beings are born into a world which is defined and governed by objective physical laws, so that same world is defined and governed by objective moral laws. Applying those strategies to real world case studies, we will develop tools to help navigate those situations where there is pressure to compromise virtue or disengage from our moral compass."

In this course, we will work on gaining an understanding of the events and developments of human experiences in Africa over the millennia and we will also examine how perspectives of scholars and people involved in African history have changed. Frequently in the past, people have emphasized how African history relates to the history of other regions, but currently, more emphasis is being given to understanding African history on its own terms. In addition, we will try to see the significance of the African historical experience in a more global or world historical perspective.\nWe will look at major themes, and the myths surrounding them, in our study of African history. These will include: writing the history of Africa, encounters, the Atlantic slave trade, imperialism and colonialism, the history of movements of distinctive African identity (including the rise of nationalism), and the experience of independence. We will also give consideration to Africa's role in globalization to the present day (and looking to the future)."

Whether Fortune 500 or small business, the ability to be nimble and strategically change in response to the fluidity of business trends is the key to success.  Yet, leading and managing change in the corporate setting is extraordinarily challenging.  Change is unsettling.  Change challenges the security of how things have been done.   Change tests the mettle of project implementation and teams.  The prospect of change often impedes creativity rather than promotes innovation in the workplace.  No one wants to be wrong or make a wrong decision in the face of change.  Hence, managers and the workforce they oversee tend to be change resistant.  In order for the organization to change, the people in the organization must be willing to change work/management styles, approaches, and attitudes.  In todays highly competitive business environment, rapid and smooth decision-making and implementation is the basis for competitive edge.\nThis course will be presented in three parts.  First, students will gain a detailed understanding of change at the macro (organizational) and micro (individual) levels.  We will identify the problems associated with anticipating, initiating and implementing change in both for profit and not for profit corporate settings.  The second part of the course will explore various techniques in promoting sound analytical corporate response to change at the senior and mid-level managerial levels.  The final part of the course is applied.  Student teams will assume leadership roles in a fictional company needing change and present their change process in class.  Students will also each prepare an analysis of a case studies of corporate change experience.  Emphasis will be placed on the process of change in the business context.

Such a question is inevitably personal and at the same time vast in scope. This question has been taken up and addressed in some form or another by a wide range of thinkers from around the globe and across human history.

They are viewed as purveyors of wisdom, personifications of reason, logical thinkers defined by their commitment to the facts and their unflinching pursuit of truth at all cost - especially hard, uncomfortable truths, the kind most of us prefer not to see. From the time of Aristotle, philosophers have approached the world as if it was the scene of a crime, a mystery to be solved, a riddle to be deciphered. Philosophers, it might be said, act as investigators whose job it is to uncover hidden truths. Like detectives, they are late on the scene, arriving after the crime has been committed. Like detectives, they rely upon the facts of existence to question and reason their way to probable answers, to what happened here and why.In this course, students will learn the art of philosophical investigation by learning to think like a detective. Questions of epistemology - what can be known - and metaphysics - why things are the way they are - will be explored in relation to mystery novels, detective shows, and works of philosophical literature."

This is a course on constructing, interpreting and communicating quantitative arguments in sports. For example, it might be quantifying injury risk for a pitcher, analyzing that risk relative to age and injury history, and then arguing to a general manager why they should or shouldn't sign player X to contract Y. Or, it might be investigating if there is a lack of competitive balance in women's college basketball, and if so, the reasons why. Students will develop statistical and writing literacy, learn basic computational skills and practice delivering oral arguments. Most importantly, students will think critically about real-world problems, where there isn't one correct solution and where there are many valid approaches.

In this context, pastoral conversion and synodal conversion are key to understand today's ecclesial proposal of an inverted pyramid that overcomes clericalism and leads to a new way of proceeding in the Church that starts from below, from the sensus fidei fidelium, and then upwards. From this perspective, we are entering in a new phase in the reception of the Council and a renewed ecclesiology, an event that involves the reform of structures and processes. This demands a conversion in the ecclesial mentality, a revision of lifestyles, practices of communal discernment, and structural reform. Therefore, the course will present synodality as a constitutive and constituent note of the Church that embraces a major reform."

The courts are an example; trade unions are another.   In history, institutions are what shaped political, economic, and social outcomes in the past.  One example is slavery.  Another is the civil rights movement.\nThis course uses these different yet often overlapping meanings of institutions to examine the American experience.  In many cases the American experience is a shared one, yet in many cases the experiences of particular groups of people are distinctly different from those of others.  Some Americans had to fight for their freedom.  Some had to fight to be recognized as U.S. citizens.  Women had to fight to be able to vote and to enter into contracts without their husbands permission.  Some Americans had to fight to marry a person of another race or of the same gender.  Others had to fight for a living wage.  Some Americans accused of crimes had to fight to ensure that their rights were protected.  Many of these fights occurred in courtrooms.  This course uses summaries of important court decisions that were both shaped by, and helped to shape, the American institutions we have today.

Which are all the relevant drivers (e.g., marketing and environmental factors) and outcomes (e.g., purchase funnel metrics) and how do they work in marketing? Which tool, of the many available, is best for which problem? In studying a range of firms across a range of contexts and industries, the course builds on recent advances in industrial organization and organizational economics. We use a number of cases and real life examples/simulations to discuss each of the points presented in the course.  As such, the course ultimately is designed to focus on the essential topics and problems of Marketing Analytics as experienced by business managers in real life situations. Ultimately, the course will emphasize two kinds of skills: Analytical skills, which are required for Marketing Analytics; and \"soft\" (i.e., leadership) skills, which are required for implementation. The course will begin with the analytical skills and then move on to implementation issues."

This question has been taken up and addressed in some form or another by a wide range of thinkers from around the globe and across human history.

They are viewed as purveyors of wisdom, personifications of reason, logical thinkers defined by their commitment to the facts and their unflinching pursuit of truth at all cost - especially hard, uncomfortable truths, the kind most of us prefer not to see. From the time of Aristotle, philosophers have approached the world as if it was the scene of a crime, a mystery to be solved, a riddle to be deciphered. Philosophers, it might be said, act as investigators whose job it is to uncover hidden truths. Like detectives, they are late on the scene, arriving after the crime has been committed. Like detectives, they rely upon the facts of existence to question and reason their way to probable answers, to what happened here and why.In this course, students will learn the art of philosophical investigation by learning to think like a detective. Questions of epistemology - what can be known - and metaphysics - why things are the way they are - will be explored in relation to mystery novels, detective shows, and works of philosophical literature."

Special attention will be paid to the contribution of the Catholic intellectual tradition in formulating an approach to justice and peace.This course highlights what is at stake when we choose one way of justice rather than another. Ultimately, we need to think about how we ought to treat other people and what kind of society we want to build.  Over the course of the semester, we will examine issues of justice related to human rights, hunger and poverty, racism, sexuality, ecology, and peace-building."

Fundamental questions remaindeeply contested, including who gets to determine where and how children are educated, who should pay for public education, whether education is a public good or a private one, and the role of education as a counter to poverty. In this course, will examine contemporary education debatesthrough the lens of deeper, unresolved conflicts, viewed from a variety of political perspectives.Among the topics will be delving into parent rights; the place of virtue in schooling; meritocracy anddiscontent; how to measure school performance (when we can't even agree on why we have schools;) the views of education within the populist new right,; and whether we still need publiceducation. Education is at the very center of our current culture wars. This course delves into the deep,unresolved conflicts to help us understand why."

And equally predictable and pervasive is the litigation that today inevitably flows from major cyberattacks, whether brought by means of a civil lawsuit or a regulatory enforcement proceeding. The stakes in such cybersecurity litigation are extremely high, with millions of dollars of damages liability and/or regulatory fines and penalties regularly being claimed.This course will explore the key issues that regularly arise in U.S. litigation arising from major cybersecurity events. It will be taught by a former private practitioner who has long been recognized as the leading privacy and cybersecurity litigator in the country. Students will learn about the various U.S. legal regimes that govern cybersecurity; how private litigants and government regulators seek to enforce those regimes in the context of major cybersecurity events; and how the targets of such enforcement efforts defend against the claims they are facing by reason of the cybersecurity event in question. The course will be structured around the various phases of a typical cybersecurity litigation, whether brought by a private litigant or a government regulator. The course will start with an overview of the theories of liability and injury, and the corresponding defenses to those theories, that are most often advanced by parties to a cybersecurity litigation. The course will then move to the discovery, class certification, and expert testimony issues that are unique to cybersecurity litigation. Along the way the class will take deep dives into some of the core issues in cybersecurity law such as what constitutes reasonable cybersecurity for personal information of another and what sort of injury must be shown in order for a private litigant or a regulator to be able to make a federal case out of a cybersecurity event. Throughout the focus will be on providing students with an understanding of both the key legal issues that tend to become focal points of cybersecurity litigation in the United States and the practical considerations that parties to cybersecurity litigation and their counsel must weigh in deciding how to address those issues in the particular case at hand."

We will couple this knowledge to make our own classes as we learn about object-oriented programming. Throughout the semester we will discover and implement basic debugging techniques. By the end of this course, students will compose Python programs that solve problems on their own."

Knowing oneself is vital for individuals who seek to shape and create the future.Self-aware leaders are more open to receiving candid feedback and pursuing self-improvement. They also are attuned to the needs, feelings, and experiences of others. Deep understanding of self helps leaders be more aware of the impact of their actions on those around them. They make decisions more thoughtfully and are more likely to consider the needs and perspectives of others. Therefore, grounding in emotional and social intelligence is fundamental to leader success. This course will equip students with insight on their current EI competence and provide tools to increase self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness, and relationship management.Students will take two self-assessments (Predictive Index and EI survey) to establish a baseline of their current levels of self-awareness. They will have the opportunity at the end of their studies to retake the assessments to learn how they have increased their self-awareness and EI skills."

Global and domestic markets are in flux, and the workforce is subject to the ebb and flow of generational dynamics.  Whether Fortune 500 or small business, the ability to be nimble and strategically change in response to the fluidity of business trends is the key to success.  Yet, leading and managing change in the corporate setting is extraordinarily challenging.  Change is unsettling.  Change challenges the security of how things have been done.   Change tests the mettle of project implementation and teams.  The prospect of change often impedes creativity rather than promotes innovation in the workplace.  No one wants to be wrong or make a wrong decision in the face of change.  Hence, managers and the workforce they oversee tend to be change resistant.  In order for the organization to change, the people in the organization must be willing to change work/management styles, approaches, and attitudes.  In todays highly competitive business environment, rapid and smooth decision-making and implementation is the basis for competitive edge.\nThis course will be presented in three parts.  First, students will gain a detailed understanding of change at the macro (organizational) and micro (individual) levels.  We will identify the problems associated with anticipating, initiating and implementing change in both for profit and not for profit corporate settings.  The second part of the course will explore various techniques in promoting sound analytical corporate response to change at the senior and mid-level managerial levels.  The final part of the course is applied.  Student teams will assume leadership roles in a fictional company needing change and present their change process in class.  Students will also each prepare an analysis of a case studies of corporate change experience.  Emphasis will be placed on the process of change in the business context.

Consequently, this course explores the definition of a theory; offers methods for leaders to create context-specific and practical theories to guide decision-making; highlights indicators for when leaders should consider updating their theories, which involves considerations of when to create new theories to supplant existing ones.

        "course_description": "Do you ever dwell, work, eat, sleep, or recreate indoors? Do the location, layout, light, acoustics, air quality, or thermal comfort of buildings affect you? Do you ever rely on wires, pipes, or ductwork to provide you with services you need? Do you use roads, bridges, rail lines, airports, water supplies, sewage treatment systems, or utilities? Then you have a stake in the built environment. Do you agree that providing for our present needs should not diminish the chance for future generations to provide for their needs? Then you have a stake in sustainability. The built environment and environmental sustainability are connected, through energy and water use, alteration of habitats, manufacture and disposal of materials, indoor environmental quality and human well being, transportation of people and goods, and in other important ways. In this course well examine and think hard about those connections. By the end of the course, well all develop a broader overview and better understanding of how to think about, assess, measure, advocate for, inhabit, design, and build a more sustainable built environment."

Most of what we know about race and other aspects of our social identity stem from the existing archives that we are often taught and encouraged to study in school. However, history has shown us that the archives were not entirely written from an objective perspective. Moreover, critical voices were left out of the pages in the archives.In this course, we will study the role and power of the Archive. We will identify and explore representations of Black identity as they are reproduced in archives including literary texts, films, and music. In addition, we will also examine responses to these images and how they have carved out opportunities to showcase their self-definition. We will discuss various topics including the legacies of slavery and colonialism as they are enacted on the Black body and the ways that Black people have forged a space to create their own narratives for themselves."

        "course_description": "Criminal cyberattacks, which were essentially unheard of two decades ago, have now become daily events in the U.S. and around the world. And equally predictable and pervasive is the litigation that today inevitably flows from major cyberattacks, whether brought by means of a civil lawsuit or a regulatory enforcement proceeding. The stakes in such cybersecurity litigation are extremely high, with millions of dollars of damages liability and/or regulatory fines and penalties regularly being claimed.This course will explore the key issues that regularly arise in U.S. litigation arising from major cybersecurity events. It will be taught by a former private practitioner who has long been recognized as the leading privacy and cybersecurity litigator in the country. Students will learn about the various U.S. legal regimes that govern cybersecurity; how private litigants and government regulators seek to enforce those regimes in the context of major cybersecurity events; and how the targets of such enforcement efforts defend against the claims they are facing by reason of the cybersecurity event in question. The course will be structured around the various phases of a typical cybersecurity litigation, whether brought by a private litigant or a government regulator. The course will start with an overview of the theories of liability and injury, and the corresponding defenses to those theories, that are most often advanced by parties to a cybersecurity litigation. The course will then move to the discovery, class certification, and expert testimony issues that are unique to cybersecurity litigation. Along the way the class will take deep dives into some of the core issues in cybersecurity law such as what constitutes reasonable cybersecurity for personal information of another and what sort of injury must be shown in order for a private litigant or a regulator to be able to make a federal case out of a cybersecurity event. Throughout the focus will be on providing students with an understanding of both the key legal issues that tend to become focal points of cybersecurity litigation in the United States and the practical considerations that parties to cybersecurity litigation and their counsel must weigh in deciding how to address those issues in the particular case at hand."
