Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to rethink their own understanding of this problem and will have the opportunity to consider a number of related thematic questions (e.g., \u201cWhy do bad things happen to good people; how can God exist if there is evil?\u201d).

Though it's a truism that race, class, and gender are co-determinants, both the media and scholarship still manage to assume (more often than not) that the working-class is white, straight, and male. This course begins by examining the historical roots of this pervasive assumption, both via primary and scholarly sources. We turn to a collection of country songs, analyzing their messages and receptions. We read several novels and one disability memoir to explore how these assumptions are mobilized and resisted. Finally, we engage ethnography, both reading and doing oral histories of blue-collar folks whose gender or sexual expression is outside the norm.\nPrerequisite(s): ICPR 290 or one course in queer studies or feminist ethnography.\nEnrollment Limit: 15\nLottery Preference(s): Gen/Sex concentrators"

While focusing on the black experience, this course will examine these temporal, imaginative spaces, claiming them as essential to all people in societies that do not acknowledge multiplicity or diversity as societal norms, and capable of conjuring semi\u00b7lost histories waiting to be revived. It will examine marronage in diasporic communities as an effort to ground, re-ground, and free bodies. Together, we will explore other diasporic-based research and approaches to understanding and experiencing embodied restoration and we will also learn a meditative embodiment process with 3 elements: mining, archiving, and witnessing. We will examine literature, animation, and film resources to broaden our dialogue to how interdisciplinary, artistic spaces make fertile foundations for embodied and restorative activism.

Thus, approaches to treat these diseases are of paramount importance for quality of life issues.  In order to develop treatments, a molecular understanding of these diseases is critical.  The underlying biophysical basis for protein misfolding and aggregation is now largely understood and involves a common structural motif called the cross-b-sheet fibril.  This course will focus on a set of diseases for which we now know quite a lot about the chemistry, molecular biology, and cell biology that underlies the misfolding behavior of the protein in question.  We will look at Alzheimer\u2019s disease, prion infectious disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and ALS or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.  While the course will focus on the primary literature that discusses the protein aggregation problem, other disciplinary areas such as genetics, cell biology, animal model systems, and clinical biology may be introduced as appropriate.\nEnrollment Limit: 15"

We will study practical and discursive activity that formed a dynamic field within which many of the contradictions of \u201cthe modern\u201d were made visible (and visual) through architecture. In this course, we will engage architectural concepts and designs by studying drawings and buildings closely within their historical context. We will examine spheres of reception for architecture and its theoretical, discursive, and cultural life through a variety of media: buildings of course, but also journals, books, and film. We will also investigate architecture as a site and subject for critical inquiry. In particular, we will see what it may tell us about the globalization and politics of the twentieth century, and about history, theory, and criticism as epistemological tracks."

The latter part of the course will focus on Athens in particular: its rise to imperial power under Pericles, its tragic decline from the Peloponnesian War and its important role as a center for the teaching of rhetoric and philosophy.  Since the study of history involves the analysis, evaluation, and synthesis of the sources available for the culture studied, students will concentrate upon the primary sources available for Greek history, exploring the strengths and weakness of these sources and the ways in which their evidence can be used to create an understanding of ancient Greece.  Students should learn how to analyze and evaluate the evidence from primary texts and to synthesize the information from multiple sources in a critical way."

Methods for reading and interpreting this large body of literature will play a key role in this part of the course.  In the second half of the semester, the focus will shift from saint to devotee.  Saints were like magnets that set the people of late antiquity into motion.  By reading pilgrim travelogues and catalogues of miraculous healings, studying the archeological and artistic evidence for pilgrimage, we will explore the profound social and cultural impact the cult of the saints had on the peoples of this period.  In addition to gaining a familiarity with the history of early Christian saints and the cults that arose around them, students will also investigate the many issues at stake in the study of late antique Christianity.  This includes but is not limited to:  the conflict between history and literature in hagiography, gender and sanctity in late antiquity, self-harm as religious practice in early Christianity, and the intersection of medicine, magic, and miracle."

This course is focused on approaches to reading the graphic novel, with a focus on a subgenre called the \u201cliterary comic.\u201d Our first approach is to consider different kinds of primary source texts and ask if and how they fulfill our understanding of the graphic narrative. This consideration will include various test cases, from wordless comics, to texts used as images, to the many varieties of word-image hybrids that are called comic books. Our second approach is to examine different scholarly approaches to analyzing graphic narratives, base d in different disciplines such as memoir studies, trauma studies, visual and material culture, history, semiotics, and, especially, narratology. Primary source readings include texts by Ware, Barry, Clowes, and Burns. Secondary readings include Hirsch, McCloud, Barthes, Iser, and Groensteen.Three short assignments due during the semester, and a final project due at the end of exam period (see description below).

Through a topics-focused course, students will examine the ways that narratives about environment have shaped the way that humans have defined themselves. We will be reading novels and short stories and viewing films that contest conventional binaries of man and animal, civilization and nature, tradition and technology, and even truth and fiction. \u201cAnimals, Vegetables, Minerals\u201d does not follow chronological or geographical frameworks, but chooses texts that engage the three categories enumerated as the major themes of our course. We will read and discuss animal theory, theories of place and landscape, and theories of modernization or mechanization; and there will be frequent (and intentional) overlap between these categories. We will also be watching films that extend our theoretical questions of thes e themes beyond national, linguistic, and generic borders. You are expected to view this course as a collaborative process in which you share responsibility for leading discussion. There are no prerequisites or language expectations, but students should have some basic knowledge of East Asian, especially Sinophone, history and culture, or be willing to do some additional reading (suggested by the instructor) to achieve an adequate contextual background for exploring these texts."

How do black poets explore black political and social life in various historical and geographical contexts? How do they use particular formal strategies (for example, form poetry, free verse, narrative poetry, and experimental modes) to interrogate notions of blackness? How do political movements around gender, class, and sexuality factor in? As we approach these questions, we will consider important critical conversations on African American poetry and poetics, examining how both well-known and underexplored poets use form to complicate blackness and imagine various forms of freedom. Our work will take us through several poetic genres and forms, including print works, performance poetry, hip hop music, and digital media. Throughout our analysis, we will consider how discourses on gender, sexuality, class, national and transnational identity, and other engagements with difference shape black poetic expression, both historically and in our current moment."

How have food and foodways been mobilized in constructions of national, regional, ethnic, and racial heritage? How have cooking and eating patterns for various groups been transformed by migration and immigration? How have consumer spaces operated as sites of kinship, community, assimilation, and resistance?

We'll move between American and British examples, aiming to track the commonalities at work in the two nations and the effects of marked structural differences. Here we'll be especially attentive to chattel slavery in the U.S., and to the relations, and non-relations, between the racialized notions of childhood produced in this country and those which arise out of Britain's sharply stratified class landscape. If race and class are produced differently, we'll also consider the degree to which British and American histories and representations of boyhood and girlhood converge and diverge across the period. We\u2019ll close with reflections on the ways in which a range of literary genres on the cusp of modernism form themselves in and through the new discourses of childhood and evolving figures of the child."

While Francophone directors from Northern and Sub-Saharan Africa debunked colonialism and neocolonialism in their films, minorities hardly appeared on French screens. Movies were made by white filmmakers for a white audience. Since the 1980's and the 1990's, minorities have become more visible in French films. Are French Blacks and Arabs portrayed in French cinema beyond stereotypes, or are they still objects of a euro-centric gaze? Have minorities gained agency in storytelling, not just as actors, but as directors? What is the national narrative at play in the recent French films that focus on diversity? Is it still \"us against them\", or has the new generation of French filmmakers found a way to include the different components of French identity into a collective subject? From Bouchareb to Gomis, from Kechiche to Benyamina and Jean-Baptiste, this course will map out the visual fault lines of the French self and examine the prospects for a post-republican sense of community. Open to non-majors. There will be a weekly screening and a 4th hour taught in French."

The selection of theoretical readings reflects the history of theory (psychoanalysis, structuralism, narratology), as well as the currents most relevant to the contemporary academic field: Post-structuralism, Post-colonialism, Gender Studies, and Ecocriticism. They are paired with a diverse range of short stories (Poe, Kafka, Camus, Borges, Calvino, Morrison, Djebar, Ngozi Adichie) that we discuss along with our study of theoretical texts. The class will be conducted in English with an additional hour in French for students wishing to take it for French credit."

These three visionaries of modernity have translated the abstract metaphysics of \"the history of the subject\" into a concrete analysis of human experience.  Their work has been a major influence on the Frankfurt School of critical theory and has also led to a revolutionary shift in the understanding and writing of history and literature now associated with the work of modern French philosophers Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Julia Kristeva, and Jacques Lacan.  Our readings will, therefore, also include short selections from these philosophers in order to analyze the contested history of modernity and its intellectual and moral consequences.  Special attention will be paid to the relation between rhetoric and philosophy and the narrative forms of \u201cthe philosophical discourse(s) of modernity\u201d (e.g., sermon and myth in Marx; aphorism and oratory in Nietzsche, myth, fairy tale, case hi/story in Freud).

As a manifestation of the nationalism sweeping over Europe during the nineteenth century, the Risorgimento aimed to unite Italy under one flag and one government. For many Italians, however, Risorgimento meant more than political unity. It described a movement for the renewal of Italian society and people beyond purely political aims. Among Italian patriots the common denominator was a desire for freedom from foreign control, liberalism, and constitutionalism. The course will discuss issues such as Enlightenment, Romanticism, Nationalism, and the complex relationship between history and literature in Foscolo, Manzoni, and Leopardi.  This course is taught in Italian.  Prerequisite: one 200 level Italian course."

We try to clarify the issues relevant to these questions by looking at the contemporary debates about the role of automation and digital media and the problem of climate change. These debates raise many questions including: the appropriate model of scientific inquiry (is there a single model for science?, how is science both experimental and deductive?, is science merely trial and error?, is science objective?, is science value-free?), the ideological standing of science (has science become a kind of ideology?), the autonomy of technology (have the rapidly developing technologies escaped our power to direct them?), the politics of science (is science somehow essentially democratic?, and are \"scientific\" cultures more likely to foster democracy?, or is a scientific culture essentially elitist and autocratic?), the relation of science to the formation of public policy (experts rule?, are we in or moving toward a technocracy?), the role of technology and science in the process of modernization, Westernization, and globalization (what role has science played in industrialization and what role does it now play in a post-industrial world?). To find an appropriate way to consider these questions, we look at the pairing of science with democracy in the Enlightenment project and study contemporary work in the philosophy of science, political science, and ethics."

These questions traverse a broad range of topics from marital infidelity and legally recognized forms of kinship to a critique of Russian imperial geopolitics and military interventions from a standpoint that prefigures Tolstoy's late-in-life radical pacifism. Next, we will read three novels (Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary, Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, Alexander Pushkin's Eugene Onegin) that, much as they predate Tolstoy's masterpiece, help us bring the central preoccupations of Anna Karenina into sharper focus. We will conclude the course with Tolstoy's late short works, a short story by Anton Chekhov, and Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, which we will contemplate as a reply to and a potential re-writing of Anna Karenina, since the English modernist famously declared that she had \"nearly every scene of Anna Karenina branded in [her.]\" All readings in English."

This course will introduce students to the fundamental concepts of sociology using the lens of the Harry Potter series. We will explore questions of hierarchy, inequality, terrorism, consumption, race,  class, and gender, and we will discuss the ways in which stratification in the wizarding world compares and contrasts to similar issues in the Muggle world. Class discussions and exercises will assume that students have read all seven Harry Potter books."

There is no other example of migration with more than 100 years of history. The copious presence of migrants concentrated in a host country, such as we have in the case of the 11.7 million Mexican migrants residing in the United States, along with another 15 million Mexican descendants, is unparalleled. The 1,933-mile-long border shared by the two countries makes it one of the longest boundary lines in the world and, unfortunately, also one of the most dangerous frontiers in the world today. We will examine the different economic, political, social and cultural forces that have shaped this centenarian migration influx and undertake a macro-, meso-, and micro-levels of analysis. At the macro-level of political economy, we will investigate the economic interdependency that has developed between Mexico and the U.S. over different economic development periods of these countries, particularly, the role the Mexican labor force has played to boosting and sustaining both the Mexican and the American economies. At the meso-level, we will examine different institutions both in Mexico and the U.S. that have determined the ways in which millions of Mexican migrate to this country. Last, but certainly not least, we will explore the impacts that both the macro-and meso-processes have had on the micro-level by considering the imperatives, aspirations, and dreams that have prompted millions of people to leave their homes and communities behind in search of better opportunities. This major life decision of migration brings with it a series of social transformations in family and community networks, this will look into the cultural impacts in both the sending and receiving migrant communities. In sum, we will come to understand how these three levels of analysis work together."

We will address questions about the stakeholders in the debates, the timing of the debates, the rise and fall of certain issues, and the charismatic influence of key players. A key component in the readings will be the connections to bio-medicine and issues of treatment versus enhancement. Readings will be drawn from philosophy, bioethics, sociology, feminist studies, and sociology of medicine.

In this course, we will examine the processes by which individual bodies are shaped by and, in turn, shape social life. Key questions to be explored include: how are bodies regulated by social forces; how do individuals perform the body and how does interactional context influence this performance; what is the meaning of the body in social life; and is there a \"right\" body?
