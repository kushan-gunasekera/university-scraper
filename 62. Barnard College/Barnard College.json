From the arrival of enslaved Africans to the recent election of President Barack Obama, black people have been central to the story of the United States, and the Americas, more broadly. African Americans have been both contributors to, and victims of, this \u201cNew World\u201d democratic experiment. To capture the complexities of this ongoing saga, this course offers an inter-disciplinary exploration of the development of African-American cultural and political life in the U.S. but also in relationship to the different African diasporic outposts of the Atlantic world. The course will be organized both chronologically and thematically, moving from the \u201cmiddle passage\u201d to the present so-called \u201cpost-racial\u201d moment\u2014drawing on a range of classical texts, primary sources, and more recent secondary literature\u2014to grapple with key questions, concerns, and problems (i.e. agency, resistance, culture, etc.) that have preoccupied scholars of African-American history, culture, and politics. Students will be introduced to a range of disciplinary methods and theoretical approaches (spanning the humanities and social sciences), while also attending to the critical tension between intellectual work and everyday life, which are central to the formation of African-American Studies as an academic field. This course will engage specific social formations (i.e. migration, urbanization, globalization, etc.), significant cultural/political developments (i.e. uplift ideologies, nationalism, feminism, Pan-Africanism, religion/spirituality, etc.), and hallmark moments/movements (i.e. Harlem Renaissance, Civil Rights movement, etc.).

In this course, we will read across genre and field to consider the myriad discourses in which Black feminist theorizing has intervened. The list of writers, artists, and thinkers whose work will guide our interrogations include Phillis Wheatley, Rebecca Cox Jackson, Zora Neale Hurston, Fanny Lou Hamer, Johnetta B.

What holds together fragmentary cultures and part societies? I find the term discourse useful for thinking about linkages and articulations within and across \u201cpart societies.\u201d\u201d And across fields. Black feminist imaginaries offer discourses which intervene in dominating narrative, language, image, and knowledge structures. Multiple areas of knowledge and knowledge production must be brought to bear.

A deep dive into Hurston\u2019s work and writing life, this course reads Hurston as a narrative stylist and theorist in multiple genres: as poet, essayist, writer of short stories, novelist, playwright, folklorist, and memorist. The goal of this class is to read Hurston closely and widely and to identify and examine her aesthetic philosophy and stylistic choices as one of the first African American women able to have a writing \u201ccareer.\u201d We will concentrate on her work from the 1920s through the 1930s, when she was at Barnard, and a leading figure in the Harlem/New Negro Renaissance. In her time, Hurston was adamant about writing for and about people like herself; she saw ordinary black people as keepers of a rich culture that should be celebrated and shared. In this spirit, the assignments for this course will lead to final digital projects that can be shared with the Barnard community in anticipation of the centennial of Hurston\u2019s matriculation and graduation from Barnard (1925-1928).

II). A second section locates Fanon in psychological theory and therapeutic theory and practice. The cultural and political (Eurocentric?) roots of psychological theory and practice are examined as are notions of oppression causing psychological and physical violence as well as psychopathology / psychological disorder. III). A third section examines Fanon and others psychological approaches to identity with particular attention to the presumed \u201cinferiority complex\u201d of oppressed peoples, nationalist and other reconstructions of identity in opposition to oppression, sociological psychological conceptualizations of stigma, and Dubois\u2019s influential ideas regarding double consciousness.

        "course_description": "\nWe are told, in one of the earliest accounts of the life and work of the Netherlandish artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder (1525\u20131569), that his prints and paintings elicited laughter. From his visualizations of carnival celebrations and children's games to peasant weddings to riotous hellscapes, the comic Bruegel makes his viewers, both in the late sixteenth century and today, question whether any of it should be taken seriously. This advanced undergraduate seminar examines Bruegel's innovative comic practice and the social context of laughter and humor in the era of the Dutch Revolt, a time fraught with social, political, and religious strife. We will explore the reception of Bruegel's work in his time, in particular the possibilities of both entertainment and didacticism for viewers. Our studies of pictorial humor in Bruegel's oeuvre will include broader investigations of the secularization of the image in the Reformation context, iconoclasm, the vernacular artistic mode, print culture in early modern Europe, humanism, global expansion and trade, the relationship between pictorial and literary humor, and the functions of satire in visual art. A field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art will allow us to encounter Bruegel's images in person",

        "course_description": "\nThis lecture class introduces the notion of global contemporary art through the history of exhibitions, chiefly biennials and other large-scale endeavors, and principal agents behind them. On the one hand, the course considers exhibitions as a crucial tool of cultural diplomacy, which seek to position and/or reposition cities, regions, and even entire nations or \u201cpeoples\u201d on the international scene. Thus, we will explore how the artistic interests vested in exhibition-making intersect with other\u2014political, economic, ideological, and cultural\u2014interests. We will consider those intersections paying special attention to the shifts in political relations and tensions during and after the Cold War, including the moment of decolonization in Africa; the moment commonly understood as \u201cglobalization\u201d and associated with the expansion of the neoliberal capitalism after 1989; and, finally, the current moment of the planetary crisis. This expansive view of the \u201cglobal contemporary art\u201d will allow us to distinguish different impetuses behind internationalism and globalism that not only seek to establish hegemony, artistic or otherwise, but also look for the means to forge transnational dialogues and solidarities. On the other hand, this class seeks to illuminate how certain artistic idioms and approaches developed after World War II achieved primacy that influences artistic production to this day. To this end, we will examine the rise of a \u201cvisionary curator\u201d as a theorist and tastemaker. We will also explore how more recent exhibitions have sought to expand the geography of the \u201ccanonized\u201d post-WWII art movements and valorize artistic production conceived outside of the so-called \u201cWest.\u201d In addition to weekly brief writing assignments (150\u2013300 words each), both in and outside of class, the students in the course will reconceive the installation of one of MoMA\u2019s permanent collection galleries (1940s-70s or 1970s-present) and produce a podcast that provides the rationale for the reinstallation in form of dialogue",

Beginning in the early 1970s (independently of, and before the advent of punk music), artists adopted and developed the format as a vehicle for visual expression, drawing from precedents in pop art, artists\u2019 books, mimiographed literary magazines, historical avant-garde movements such as dada, and more contemporaneous developments in conceptual art and mail art. Overlooked in favor of artists\u2019 books and artists\u2019 magazines, on the one hand, and in favor of various types of music- or personal expression-based zines, on the other, the artist\u2019s zine forms a rich and multifaceted genre spanning over five decades of practice. This course will examine the artist\u2019s zine in the contexts of both art and music history, issues related to the expression and exploration of race, gender, and sexaulity, and the notions of networking and community building. Although distinct from the development of punk rock, artists\u2019 zine practice has forged and maintains a close connection to it and to its evolution into Queercore, Riot Grrrl, and Afropunk, all of which are covered in the course readings",

One is the undisputable fact that the global HIV/AIDS pandemic is ongoing and that the disease continues to shape the way artists and activists grapple with public health, national policy, and medical injustice. The other is my own polemic-in-formation, which is that the eruption of AIDS in the 1980s was the threshold event that inaugurated what is now understood to be \u201cthe contemporary\u201d within the art world. Rather than periodize the start of \u201cthe contemporary\u201d with the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall, as has become conventional, we will investigate how the AIDS crisis precipitated a sudden urgency that more decisively marks this transition, in particular around the promiscuous inclusion of non-fine art forms such as demonstration posters, zines, and handmade quilts. We will read foundational texts on HIV/AIDS organizing and look at interventions with graphic design, wheat-pasting, ashes action protests, body maps, embroidery, performance-based die-ins, voguing, film/video, and photography. We will consider: the inextricability of queer grief, anger, love, and loss; lesbian care; the trap of visibility; spirituality and death; activist exhaustion; the role played by artists of color within ACT-UP; and dis/affinities across the US, Latin America, and South Africa.

The time frame starts with the conquest of England in 1066 and ends with the appointment of Gothic experts in 1399 to advise on the construction of Milan Cathedral towards the end of the Middle Ages. The first historical event coincides with the creation of architecture of a bewildering scale while the second reflects the end of building without architectural treatises or architectural theory - in a modern sense. The course will also introduce students to new digital technologies such as laser scanning and photogrammetry for the study of medieval architecture. No preliminary knowledge of medieval history or architectural history is needed, and no knowledge of digital technologies or specific computer skills is expected. The monuments selected belong to a period that starts when architecture moved away from Roman antique models and ends just before the re-adoption of Classical standards in the Renaissance. In this course the originality of medieval architecture, its relationship with earlier and later monuments, and the dramatic effort involved in its creation will be discussed. Major themes of medieval society such as pilgrimages, crusades, piety, the cult of relics, and the social and intellectual context of the Middle Ages are also part of this lecture. In the first weeks, important concepts of medieval society and its architecture will be presented in combination with a number of new technologies recently adopted in the field. These introductory classes will offer the foundations needed to understand artistic and architectural developments in the Middle Ages. While the course will focus on architecture, different media are included when they provide valuable information on the artistic and cultural context to which buildings belong.

Starting with Mecca in the 6th century and ending with the urban and architectural expansions of the same city today. Damascus, Baghdad, Samarra, Kairouan, Cordoba, Bukhara, Cairo, Konya, Istanbul, Algiers, Touba and others will be examined and a critical depiction of urban and architectural monuments, influential artistic schools, and notable artworks that were produced in and around each of these urban centers will be offered. Each session is a snapshot of a city at a specific period of time with a clear emphasis on the broader intellectual, economic, ecological and political contexts surrounding the production of art and architecture in the Muslim world. Turning away from a classical dynastic reading of Islamic arts, this course centers the role theological debates, Sufi mysticism, legal innovations, economic exchanges and migration of people, ideas and technologies played in the birth and developments of a Muslim aesthetic tradition",

We discuss too how temples, monasteries, tombs, and shrines supported the pursuit of pleasure, amusement, sociability, and other worldly interests. We also explore the symbiotic relationship between Indic religions and kingship, and the complex ways in which politics and court culture shaped sacred environments.

The development of illumination is closely linked to the cultural and economic situation of the Low Countries during more than eight centuries, but it is also deeply influenced by the intersection of contacts in European artistic, religious and intellectual contexts. The links between artistic networks in other media, the mobility of artists, models and materials are crucial to understanding the production of illuminated manuscripts and to framing them as fully representative of the dynamics of the cultural habitat of the Low Countries. The course will be illustrated with numerous examples and case studies of manuscripts in collections in Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as in collections in US and around the world. A special file rouge in the course will be devoted to recent research approaches in material culture and digital access of illuminated manuscripts. The course will be accompanied by PPP and a reading list to guide students ( scans and online resources will be provided).

These objects were assembled in European libraries, museum and other types of archives. This was also a pivotal period for the trajectory of such disciplines as history and (pre-)archaeology and for the creation of new institutions devoted to learning and knowledge preservation.

Cities are physical places, yet, they are also assemblages of different layers of time, and geographies. These layers are designed to create communal identities and evoke recollections of past memories. Focus will be put on the written history of these spaces by searching in archives (in the City of New York) and digging out written and oral information about the histories of the formation of these spaces and their interactions with their surroundings. The course will cover many monuments, like the famous obelisk in Central Park or the lessknown Jordanian column in Flushing Meadows Park in Queens; public buildings like Central Synagogue on Lexington, the Islamic Cultural Center on Upper East Side Mosque, or Olana State Historic Site in Hudson, NY; but also, the inner decorations of restaurants, bars (the Carlyle Bar) and even oriental Halal shops, as well as ephemeral spaces like international fairs, and Cairene grill boots. Traditionally, Islamic art and Islamic architecture have been studied separately within art history and architecture history disciplines. The purpose of this course is, in the first place, to bridge the gap between the two disciplines while working across theories of visual culture and critically revisiting urban studies.

        "course_description": "\nThis seminar combines close looking and reading with writing imaginatively. With the help of an array of textual and visual material we explore how early South Asians thought about death, dying, and the afterlife. Students will be encouraged to react to these primary sources in order to develop their writing muscles and incorporate a range of ekphrastic stances into their writing. You have the option to write weekly creative texts for which prompts will be given or produce a critical reading response. Final projects can be either a research paper or a longer creative work such as a literary essay, poem sequence, short story, film, or mixed media project. Topics of discussion include the moment of death and the kinds of death valorized by various social groups, rituals of mourning and remembrance, the iconography of death, conceptions of afterworlds and their inhabitants, the afterlives of objects and persons, and such Indic concepts as rebirth, karma, samadhi, and nirvana. We will read literary, political, religious, and art-historical texts, and consider Buddhist, Hindu, and Jaina perspectives as well as contemporary prose and poetry. Visual examples run the gamut: memorial buildings, relics and reliquaries, prints capturing the rewards and punishments of the afterlife, mandalas and cosmological maps, and the striking portrayals of the god of death and ghosts and ghouls on temple walls, paintings, and textiles",

First, a social and political history of archaeology, emphasizing how the nature of current theoretical and practical knowledge has been shaped and defined by previous research traditions and, second, how the current political situation in the region impinges upon archaeological practice. Themes include: the dominance of \"biblical archaeology\" and the implications for Palestinian archaeology, Islamic archaeology, the impact of European contact from the Crusades onwards, and the development of prehistory",

By examining both categories and practices, we will ask: What kinds of relationships exist between the messiness of everyday life and the classifications used by both scholars and \"local\" people to describe and make sense of it?

Second, how have social forces shaped practices of food acquisition, preparation, and consumption (and how, in turn, has food shaped society)? We will explore these questions from various evolutionary, physiological, and cultural viewpoints, highlighted by information from the best archaeological and historic case studies.

In this course, we explore the global conditions that give rise to local body burdens, plumbing the history of toxicity as a category, the politics of toxic exposures, and the experience of toxic embodiment. Foregrounding uneven exposures and disproportionate effects, we ask how scientists and humanists, poets and political activists, have understood toxicity as a material and social phenomenon.

Students must have declared a major in Anthropology prior to registration. Students must have a 3.6 GPA in the major and a preliminary project concept in order to be considered. Interested students must communicate/meet with thesis instructor in the previous spring about the possibility of taking the course during the upcoming academic year. Additionally, expect to discuss with the instructor at the end of the fall term whether your project has progressed far enough to be completed in the spring term. If it has not, you will exit the seminar after one semester, with a grade based on the work completed during the fall term. This two-term course is a combination of a seminar and a workshop that will help you conduct research, write, and present an original senior thesis in anthropology. Students who write theses are eligible to be considered for departmental honors. The first term of this course introduces a variety of approaches used to produce anthropological knowledge and writing; encourages students to think critically about the approaches they take to researching and writing by studying model texts with an eye to the ethics, constraints, and potentials of anthropological research and writing; and gives students practice in the seminar and workshop formats that are key to collegial exchange and refinement of ideas. During the first term, students complete a few short exercises that will culminate in a substantial draft of one discrete section of their senior project (18-20 pages) plus a detailed outline of the expected work that remains to be done (5 pages). The spring sequence of the anthropology thesis seminar is a writing intensive continuation of the fall semester, in which students will have designed the research questions, prepared a full thesis proposal that will serve as a guide for the completion of the thesis and written a draft of one chapter. Only those students who expect to have completed the fall semester portion of the course are allowed to register for the spring; final enrollment is contingent upon successful completion of first semester requirements. In spring semester, weekly meetings will be devoted to the collaborative refinement of drafts, as well as working through issues of writing (evidence, voice, authority etc.). All enrolled students are required to present their project at a symposium in the late spring, and the final grade is based primarily on successful completion of the thesis/ capstone project. Note: The senior thesis seminar is open to CC and GS majors in Anthropology only. It requires the instructor\u2019s permission for registration. Students must have a 3.6 GPA in the major and a preliminary project concept in order to be considered. Interested students should communicate with the thesis instructor and the director of undergraduate study in the previous spring about the possibility of taking the course during the upcoming academic year. Additionally, expect to discuss with the instructor at the end of the fall term whether your project has progressed far enough to be completed in the spring term. If it has not, you will exit the seminar after one semester, with a grade based on the work completed during the fall term. Enrollment limit is 15. Requirements: Students must have completed the requirements of the first semester of the sequence and seek instructor approval to enroll in the second",

In particular we examine links between imperial colonialism and liberal democracy in terms of different techniques of administering social difference (e.g. race, multiculturalism, class, population, ...). We critically investigate the role of the discipline of anthropology within this rubric and read several ethnographies that dwell on the interrelation of care and vulnerability.

We will investigate the connected histories and theories of humanitarianism and colonialism, which have not only shaped lives as people inhabit spaces of emergency, but produced rationales for the construction of landscapes and domesticities of refuge, enacted spatial violence and territorial contestations, and structured architectural knowledge. The course examines iconic forms such as refugee camps in relation to histories of colonial institutions such as archives and prisons.

This course will introduce students to things, practices, figures, and ideas behind this contentious and contradictory concept, emerging in multiple locations around the world. Students in this course will learn about architecture as it was practiced, taught, thought, and experienced across landscapes of social and cultural difference during the past two centuries. Learning about the past through historical consciousness around architecture and investigating the history of architecture as a discursive field are fundamental to liberal arts thinking generally, and important for students in architecture, the history and theory of architecture, art history, and urban studies. Students in this course will be introduced to:Architecture as enmeshed with other forms of cultural productionCulturally-specific intellectual and public debates around the architectural and urbanMakers, thinkers, and organizers of the designed or built environmentGeographies, territories, and mobilities associated with architecture as an end or means for material extraction, refinement, trade, labor, and constructionSites, institutions, media, events, and practices which have come to hold meaning Modernity, modernism, and modernization in relation to each other, as social, cultural, and technological drivers holding stakes for past events as well their histories. In this course, we will ask questions about ideas and practices within disparate socially-and culturally-constructed worlds, and across other asymmetries. For example, can we draw a coherent historical thread through Lisbon in 1755, Bombay in 1854, Moscow in 1917, the moon in 1969, and al-Za\u2019atari refugee camp in 2016? Are such narratives of coherence themselves the trace of the modernist impulse in architectural history?

The course interrogates our changing attitudes to nature from the 18th century to the present, focusing on the artistic and architectural responses to these perceptions. It aims to demonstrate the important role that artists and architects have played, and are to play, in making visible the sources of environmental degradation and in the development of new means of mitigating anthropogenic ecological change. City, Landscape, Ecology is divided into three parts. Part I explores important episodes in the history of landscape: picturesque garden theory, notions of \u201cwilderness\u201d as epitomized in national and state parks in the United States, Modern and Postmodern garden practices, and the prevalence of landscape in the work of artists from the 1960s to the present. The purpose here is to better understand the role that territorial organization plays in the construction of social practices, human subjectivities, and technologies of power. We then turn to ecology and related issues of climate, urbanization and sustainability in Part II. Here we will look at the rise of ecological thinking in the 1960s; approaches to the environment that were based on the systems-thinking approach of the era. In the session \u201cCapitalism, Race and Population Growth\u201d we examine the history of the \u201ccrisis\u201d of scarcity from Thomas Robert Malthus, to Paul R. Ehrlich (The Population Bomb, 1968) to today and look at questions of environmental racism, violence and equity. The course concludes with Part III (Hybrid Natures). At this important juncture in the course, we will ask what is to be done today. We\u2019ll examine the work of contemporary theorists, architects, landscape architects, policy makers and environmentalists who have channeled some of the lessons of the past in proposing lasting solutions to our land management and ecological crises of the present and future",

        "course_description": "\nThis seminar turns a lens on partitions, borders, and camps. Whereas these iconic forms have been studied most often through legal, policy, or social science lenses, we will consider them conceptually, aesthetically, and historically as complex practices of architectural formmaking in the long twentieth century. The partition, the border, and the camp can each be understood as a legal and territorial concept, a symbolic and aesthetic marker of violent land demarcation, a material environment, and an intersection of spatial practices. Through careful readings and discussion, we will look closely at each as an illumination of irreducible entanglements between politics and aesthetics, and sensible expressions of colonial practices that persist in the built environment. In this course, students examine histories of partitions from Ireland to Somalia to Pakistan, and their reification as borders. Understanding partition as a concept and a process rather than a determinate end, the course examines histories of built environments that create the illusion of determinacy by reinforcing territorial markers: whether through large intentional projects, for example, the construction of a new state capital at Chandigarh in India, or unstated means, for example, the responsive humanitarian or detention architectures of camps at borders in Palestine and East Africa. The course will examine the robust discourse on the materialities of borders, thinking beyond the construction of walls to sometimes obscured forms of spatial anchoring across divides, for example, mediatic traversals, animal crossings, or the work of crowds. The course examines histories of camps, from the concentration technologies used during the Spanish American War in Cuba and the Boer War in South Africa in the nineteenth century to twenty-first century ephemeral environments enabling people to crystallize forms of dissidence, whether at Wall street in New York or Shaheen Bagh in Delhi. We analyze processes by which the refugee camp enclosure racializes, genders, sexualizes, and controls bodies, precipitating a self-partitioning by asylum seekers in the performance of vulnerability. Although the constructed environments of camps serve as repositories of power, regardless of their purpose (and regardless of their orientation toward control or care\u2014for example, whether made to confine migrants or to shelter refugees), they are iconic for their impermanence, and it is precisely their partial persistence that establishes them as epistemic sources often needing to stand in for missing documentary archives. To explore these and other problematics raised by partitions, borders, and camps, students in this course lead discussions on shared readings (2-4 articles or book chapters per week). All course materials will be provided, and discussions are used generatively to build a basis for understanding complex subjects through interdisciplinary means. Students write papers based on in-depth independent research on a subject selected in consultation with the professor. The research and writing of a final paper is scaffolded across the semester, with special sessions of the course targeted toward the development of students\u2019 scholarly research and methods",

        "course_description": "\nThis seminar introduces students to architectural and environmental histories of abolition through constructed environments, spatial practices, and texts from the eighteenth century to the present. The course locates abolition in social movements and historical discourses, examining the roles that both reform and radical refusal have played in struggles for spatial justice by considering debates around enslavement, prisons, and borders. The course situates abolition as a significant intersectional feminist problem, and conceptually core to the consideration of race in global architectural history. We examine individual and collective works of architecture, art, landscape, and material culture, which highlight incarceration and the production of enclosure within the institutions that have shaped them in various parts of the world, and as elements of the formation of space, power, and knowledge in colonial and postcolonial contexts. The seminar is structured around multiple full-book engagements. We will closely read three texts that are foundational to the literature on abolition and architecture: Are Prisons Obsolete? by Angela Y. Davis; Golden Gulag: Prisons, Surplus, Crisis, and Opposition in Globalizing California by Ruth Wilson Gilmore; and Marking Time: Art in the Age of Mass Incarceration by Nicole Fleetwood. These readings are complemented by articles and other shorter texts, and works of art and architecture, which help to contextualize and draw out the themes of the course. Each student leads seminars on the readings and builds on this foundation by engaging in independent research, culminating in a long-format paper that intervenes in the discourse or frames a narrative, presenting an architectural history of abolition",

We will ask after what texts are doing in the world when they tell stories that seem to celebrate and delight in the subversive, the strange, and the sinister.

This course serves to familiarize students with the spectrum of biomolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, nucleic acids, etc.) as well as the fundamental chemical processes (glycolysis, citric acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism, etc.) that allow life to happen. The course will end with a discussion of diseases that have biochemical etiologies. In particular, this course will employ active learning techniques and critical thinking problem-solving to engage students in answering the question: how is the complexity of life possible?

What are the agents that cause this to occur? How do current findings about genes, cells, and organisms ranging from yeast cells to humans inform us about cancer? How do findings about cancer teach us new biological concepts? Over the past few years there have been great inroads into answering these questions which have led to new ways to diagnose and treat cancer. This course will discuss cancer from the point of view of basic biological research. We will cover topics in genetics, molecular and cell biology that are relevant to understanding the differences between normal and cancer cells. These will include tumor viruses, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, cell cycle regulation, programmed cell death and cell senescence.

Furthermore, some ancient RNA molecules combine the roles of both genotype and phenotype into a single molecule. These multi-tasking RNAs offering a possible solution to the paradox of which came first: DNA or proteins. This seminar explores the link between modern RNA, metabolism, and insights into a prebiotic RNA world that existed some 3.8 billion years ago. Topics include the origin of life, replication, and the origin of the genetic code; conventional, new, and bizarre forms of RNA processing; structure, function and evolution of key RNA molecules, including the ribosome, and RNA therapeutics including vaccines. The format will be weekly seminar discussions with presentations. Readings will be taken from the primary literature, emphasizing seminal and recent literature. Requirements will be student presentations, class participation, and a final paper",

These techniques are being applied to basic research, exploratory studies of cancer and other diseases, drug discovery and many other topics. Emphasis will be on mastery of practical techniques of sample preparation, liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry (LC/MS) with electrospray ionization, and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption and Ionization (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Database searching and interpretation for identification of proteins will be intensively studied, and practiced supported by background tutorials and exercises covering other techniques used in proteomics. Open to students in M.A. in Biotechnology Program (points can be counted against laboratory requirement for that program), Ph.D. and advanced undergraduate students with background in genetics or molecular biology.

The first goal is to explain the fundamental approaches used by physical chemists to understand the behavior of molecules and to develop related analytical tools. The second goal is to prepare students to apply these methods themselves to their own molecular biology research projects. The course will be divided into seven modules: (i) solution thermodynamics with an emphasis on application to analysis of protein structure, folding, and binding interactions; (ii) hydrodynamic methods; (iii) statistical analysis of experimental data; (iv) molecular dynamics calculations; (v) optical spectroscopy with an emphasis on fluorescence; (vi) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; and (vii) light-scattering and diffraction methods including an overview of cryogenic electron microscopy reconstruction methods. In each module, the underlying physical theories and models will be presented and used to derive the mathematical equations applied to the analysis of experimental data. Weekly recitations will emphasize the analysis of real experimental data and understanding the applications of biophysical experimentation in published research papers. The problem sets emphasize use of PyMOL for analysis of macromolecular structures and use of standard curve-fitting software for analysis of protein binding data; detailed tutorials on the related methods are provided in the recitation sections. The first three modules will be covered in Biophysical Chemistry I during the fall term, while the final three will be covered in Biophysical Chemistry II during the spring term, and treatment of molecular dynamics calculations will be divided between the two terms",

You will learn the analytical tools developed in universities, in consulting and industrial firms, and even in the military.

In early stages, managers need to achieve a good person-job fit, find mentors, and build an effective social network. At the mid-career stage, managers need to lead an effective unit with increasing complexity and responsibilities.

The study of the brain is one of the most exciting frontiers in science and medicine today. Although neuroscience is by nature a multi-disciplinary effort, chemistry has played many critical roles in the development of modern neuroscience, neuropharmacology, and brain imaging. Chemistry, and the chemical probes it generates, such as molecular modulators, therapeutics, imaging agents, sensors, or actuators, will continue to impact neuroscience on both preclinical and clinical levels. In this course, two major themes will be discussed. In the first one, titled Imaging brain function with chemical tools, we will discuss molecular designs and functional parameters of widely used fluorescent sensors in neuroscience (calcium, voltage, and neurotransmitter sensors), their impact on neuroscience, pros and cons of genetically encoded sensors versus chemical probes, and translatability of these approaches to the human brain. In the second major theme, titled Perturbation of the brain function with chemical tools, we will examine psychoactive substances, the basics of medicinal chemistry, brain receptor activation mechanisms and coupled signaling pathways, and their effects on circuit and brain function. We will also discuss recent approaches, failures and successes in the treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Recent advances in precise brain function perturbation by light (optogenetics and photopharmacology) will also be introduced. In the context of both themes we will discuss the current and future possibilities for the design of novel materials, drawing on the wide molecular structural space (small molecules, proteins, polymers, nanomaterials), aimed at monitoring, modulating, and repairing human brain function.

The main purpose of the course is to introduce students to modern synthetic chemistry via the selected series of topics (synthetic planning and the logic of organic assembly, classical and new reactions/methods and their use in complex target synthesis). Mechanistic underpinning of the discussed reaction processes will also be briefly discussed. For each module (see the content below), specific examples of syntheses of natural products and/or synthetic materials will be provided. In addition to lectures by Prof. Sames, students will select and present relevant papers in the class (the number of student symposia will depend on the final enrollment in this course). The basic knowledge of transition metal chemistry is recommended for the cross-coupling reactions (i.e. structure, electron counting, and elemental reaction types of transition metals)",

Over the course of the semester, we will explore how Nubians and Egyptians viewed one another as well as how both Egyptians and Nubians experienced and were experienced by immigrants, colonizers, and travelers. Throughout the ancient Mediterranean, as we\u2019ll see, self-definitions and cultural boundaries shifted radically according to changing power dynamics both within groups and between them. In seminar discussions, we\u2019ll pose the following questions: How and when did groups who saw themselves as distinct from one another cooperate and intermarry? Define themselves in opposition to other groups or actively blur boundaries? Mobilize concepts of ethnicity or race to justify oppression? Engage in competition or resistance? Where, we will ask, did societies fracture and/or integrate? And what role did bicultural individuals play in cultural conversations and mediations? We will also seek to understand how our conceptions of ethnicity and race in the past are influenced not only by the biases of the present but by the methodologies we employ. In our discussions and investigations this semester we will learn a great deal about Northeast Africa in antiquity \u2013 but, so too, about ethnicity, concepts of race, and power throughout the ancient Mediterranean",

While suffering the travails that separated them, they were often transported (by bandits, pirates, slave traders, armies, etc.) all across the Eastern Mediterranean. Over the semester, we will map these movements using the open-source geographical information system QGIS and discuss the choices that authors (and their characters) made, the cultural perceptions of settlements and their inhabitants, and the various affordances of different geographic regions (where bandits lurk, for example).

Although celebrity is often viewed as a phenomenon projected from above on a passive audience, we will approach it as a dynamic of negotiation and contestation involving equally powerful participants: public(s) and celebrities. We will apply a diverse range of critical methodologies in approaching these questions, and we will likewise read broadly from ancient authors both well known (Thucydides, Plato, Aristophanes) and less commonly approached in undergraduate courses (from the celebrity orator Dio Chrysostom and the enigmatic satirist Lucian of Samosata to the 3rd century dream interpreter Artemidorus).

Writers from different national traditions have been avidly reading each other, wherever they happen to come from, and they often resist national and regional labels altogether. If you ask the Somali writer Nuruddin Farah whether the precocious child of Maps was inspired by Salman Rushdie\u00b4s Midnight\u00b4s Children, he will answer (at least he did when I asked him) that he and Rushdie both were inspired by Sterne\u00b4s Tristram Shandy and Grass\u00b4s The Tin Drum. At the same time, the human experiences around which novelists organize their fiction are often themselves global, explicitly and powerfully but also mysteriously. Our critical language is in some ways just trying to catch up with innovative modes of storytelling that attempt to be responsible to the global scale of interconnectedness on which, as we only rarely manage to realize, we all live.

        "course_description": "\nThis course examines the evolution of pacifist thought in literature from the interwar years to the dawn of the atomic age. It seeks to study the literature of twentieth-century pacifism as a response to expanding technologies of modern warfare. The course asks the following questions, among others: What shape does pacifist thought take in the atomic age, and how does it compare with interwar pacifism? What similarities or differences are discernible? What role do literary representations of modern warfare play in the evolution of pacifist thought? Does pacifism gain persuasive power through these representations, or do they lay bare its limits? How might one understand pacifism\u2019s conceptual relation to nonviolence, anti-war resistance, and anti-militarism? The course begins with works by pacifist writers in the interwar years: Bertrand Russell, Why Men Fight (1917); the correspondence between Einstein and Freud in 1932; Aldous Huxley, \u201cWhat Are You Going to Do About It?\u201d (1936) and Eyeless in Gaza (1936); Virginia Woolf, Three Guineas (1938) and \u201cThoughts on Peace in an Air Raid\u201d (1940); Vera Brittain, \u201cWomen and Peace\u201d (1940). The course then considers the evolution of pacifism in the shadow of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, focusing on novels, memoirs, essays, short stories, and films, including the following works: Aldous Huxley, Ape and Essence (1948); M. K. Gandhi, For Pacifists (1949); Pearl Buck, Command the Morning (1959); Alfred Coppel, Dark December (1960); Masuji Ibuse, Black Rain (1965); Kenzaburo Oe, Hiroshima Notes (1965) and Fire from the Ashes, ed. (1985); Anand Patwardhan, War and Peace (2002, documentary); Howard Zinn (ed.), The Power of Nonviolence (2002). The course encourages students to view selected films probing pacifist and anti-war themes alongside literary and philosophical texts, with a view to grasping the themes\u2019 adaptability across various genres. Students must apply to enrol in the seminar, providing information about year, school, relevant prior coursework, and reasons for wanting to take the course.

In addition, Puerto Ricans, who are colonial migrants, number 1.2 million or 9\uff05 of the city\u2019s population. During the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, New York City was a pivotal space for Caribbean radical praxis understood here as political action and thought shaped by the Caribbean experiences of enslavement, coloniality, and diaspora. These interventions deeply transformed not only New York but multiple other contexts in Latin America, Africa, and Europe, and a broad range of movements including anti-colonial, anti-racist, feminist, and queer.

It will also ask how extraordinary this moment in fact was, looked at from the perspective of literature as a whole, by inspecting earlier examples of atrocities committed in classical antiquity, in the Crusades, against Native Americans and (in Tolstoy) against the indigenous inhabitants of the Caucasus. Before the concept of the non-combatant had been defined, could there be a concept of the atrocity? Could a culture accuse itself of misconduct toward the members of some other culture?

The works of Sappho, Dante, Rilke, C\u00e9saire or Cavafy raise the question of reception in relation to many different critical approaches and illustrate many different strategies of translation and adaptation. The very issue of intertextuality that challenged the validity of author-centered courses after Roland Barthes\u2019s proclamation of the death of the author reinstates it if we are willing to engage the oeuvre as an on-going interpretive project. By examining the poetry of the Greek Diaspora poet C. P.

Just Netflix.\u201d (Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, 2016) The word \u201cNetflix\u201d refers not simply to the American online video store that became a streaming service in the twenty-first century\uff06#39;s first decade and an international production company in the second. It is a synecdoche for the widespread popularization of Internet TV seen in the success of SVODs (subscription video-on-demand services) like Amazon Prime Video, Disney , and Apple TV . The course will focus on the pioneering role of the Netflix streaming service and its dominant role in the creation and distribution of popular film and television content. In recent years, the success of internationally acclaimed productions has signaled a renewed interest in global histories and cultures, many of which were produced by Netflix and made available worldwide through its streaming service. The course discusses how processes of distribution and redistribution set in motion by the streaming service call for us to reconsider and reapproach ideas advanced by cultural studies that now seem unsuitable for delineating the full scope of Internet TV\u2019s proliferation. We analyze Netflix series in the global scene and examine how global contents are tied to the emergence of unique genres. How do recent Netflix productions change, modify, or reimagine the narratives of national histories and cultures globally? Has the international online platform and film market more generally changed national images and stereotypes? More specifically, which genre conventions emerge from global politics and these new modes of streaming services? How have the series assimilated to international market conditions and audiences? Has the serial dispositive of television (as opposed to film), as well as the different viewing venues (private space of one\u2019s home) and mode of consumption (binging), changed how global contents are presented? Each week will focus on a different genre and analyze central episodes from two different series",

        "course_description": "\nNearly fifty years after the publication of Edward Said\u2019s groundbreaking work Orientalism, the book is as relevant as ever. At the same time, there have been countless attempts to broaden the scope of inquiry to explore constructions of the Middle East and Asia from different cultural, historical, and theoretical perspectives, including feminist and Marxist revisions of Said\u2019s conceptualization as well as important work examining the role of race and religion. Focusing on the Germanophone context, this seminar traces the interrelationship between Orientalism\u2014the study of the Orient\u2014and the evolution of German scholarship and empire. Without having an imperial presence in the Middle East, Germany quickly developed an authoritative role in the study of many Orientalist fields, prompting several questions. Can Said\u2019s framework be used to describe the experience of non-colonial powers in the Middle East? To what extent was German Orientalism informed by Germany\u2019s colonial experiences\u2014its belated acquisition of overseas colonies and its quasi-colonial relationship with Eastern European states? How does Orientalism reflect Germany\u2019s own nation-building efforts to fabricate a mythic, ancient past? How did Nazi Orientalism perpetuate and exploit these myths? With the contemporary resurgence of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in the Middle East and West, these questions take on renewed importance. Concluding with a discussion of the \u201cmigrant crisis\u201d in Europe, this seminar proposes that a historical study of Orientalism can increase sensitivities to the cultural complexities of today\u2019s global environment. Through an interdisciplinary focus on literature, visual arts, and theory, this seminar critically examines the role of scholarship and academia in exploring how humanities can shape and alter such perceptions. Does the study of Orientalism unwittingly contribute to the problem by perpetuating stereotypes and myths while undermining the agency of colonized or non-Western peoples?",

        "course_description": "\nIn the first eight months of 2023, the American Library Association (ALA) reported a staggering 1,915 attempts to censor library materials. This marks a 20\uff05 increase from the same reporting period in 2022, which saw the highest number of book challenges since ALA began compiling the data more than 20 years ago. This stark increase calls for a serious reflection on censorship in its present and past forms. In this course, we will delve into book censorship examining its mechanisms in one of the most infamous historical instances: Fascist censorship in Italy (1922-1945), focusing in particular its effects on the circulation of U.S. literature. By delving into these historical instances of censorship, the course aims to provide critical tools to interpret the present. While it is true that censorship may have disastrous effects on cultural life and the social fabric \u2013 stifling ideas and impacting creativity \u2013 at times it also inspires resistance, elicits acts of defiance, and transforms forbidden books into sought-after cultural objects. In this course we will discuss the intended and unintended effects of censorship from the vantage point of the circulation of American literature under Fascism. We will examine the measures taken by the Fascist regime to implement censorship in Italy, analyze specific instances of banned books, along with cases of redactions or re-framing of publications. Additionally, we will explore the translation of U.S. texts, discussing cases of self-censorship by translators and exploring the potential for resistance embedded in the act of translating. Finally, we will describe the effects of censorship on writing practices in Italy. We will explore the counterintuitive effect of prestige that arises due to censorship and the consequent imitation of American models by young Italian-speaking writers. To engage with these topics we will discuss a diverse range of primary sources including archival documents, legislation, short stories, novels, and poems by prominent Italian and U.S. writers such as Cesare Pavese, Elio Vittorini, Gertrude Stein, and Ernest Hemingway. In addition, we will listen to musical pieces, watch original newsreels, and read letters between Italian and American authors",

It works globally along two lines: a theoretical one that accommodates conceptualizations of self-narrative in relation to shifting categories of center and margin; and a thematic one that selects a number of Arabic autobiographical texts with strong thematic concerns that cut across multiple cultures. Although Europe sounds at times more conspicuous in early 20th century autobiography, the Afro-Asian and Latin American topographical and historical itinerary and context are no less so, especially in writings we associate with societal and cultural transformations. More than historical accounts, these intellectual itineraries speak for the successes and failures of the secular ideology of the Arab nation-state. They convey the struggle of intellectuals-- as self-styled leaders, for an ideal state on the ruins of the past. The course studies a number of autobiographical works; memoirs and reminiscences that are meant to rationalize and reproduce a writer\u2019s experience. Probably self-censored, these serve nevertheless as trajectories for a secular journey rather than one from denial to affirmation. Staunchly established in modernity and its nahdah paradigms, most of these writings are secular itineraries that rarely end in a search for faith. They are the journeys of a generation of Arab intellectuals who are facing many crises, but not the crisis of faith. They provide another look at the making of the Arab intelligentsia- and probably the Afro-Asian and Latin American one, since the early 20th century, and help us discern not only achievements on the level of education and public service , but also the mounting discontent with failures that have been wrapping the formation of the nation state.

If trauma epitomizes suffering and pleasure represents enjoyment, is there any relation between these experiences? And yet, how else to explain that people seem endlessly addicted to negative experiences, or that traumatized people often try to recreate the damage they endured? We are living in an age of endless trauma, and everywhere we go, we hear that trauma is destructive, anathema to pleasure, that it destroys our sense of self, our security, our stability, and identity. We are taught to avoid trauma at all costs because it is harmful and inimical to flourishing. New statistics routinely confirm that we are living through a trauma epidemic in which ordinary people experience symptoms of extreme distress, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, nightmares, and difficulty sleeping. Every year, new memoirs are published in which protagonists detail their endless battles with traumatic adversity and most television shows, across a variety of genres, include trauma as a subplot to character development (Ted Lasso, Euphoria, True Detective, to name a few). Referring to its growing pervasiveness, the New Yorker critic Parul Sehgal wrote a controversial essay, \u201cThe Case Against the Trauma Plot\u201d (2021) in which she criticizes our culture\u2019s overreliance on trauma as a primary trope of character development, forcing us to ask: is trauma really as widespread as we think? how did trauma become such a popular \u2018identity\u2019? what work is trauma doing for us, as individuals and as a culture? Is it possible to recognize the ubiquity of trauma while also acknowledging that we often seek situations which are harmful, even traumatizing, that we might be attracted to suffering for reasons we don\u2019t yet understand? This course examines the complex relationship between trauma and pleasure by familiarizing students with the clinical and theoretical concepts at the core of contemporary trauma and critical theory. We will focus specifically on the topics of: sexuality, perversion, trauma, identity, relationality, narcissism, gender and attachment in order to explore how these concepts work today. Delving into theoretical writing by Foucault, Bersani, Edelman, Berlant, Butler, Dean and Preciado, as well as clinical writing by major psychoanalysts, Freud, Laplanche, Loewald, Lacan, Laplanche and Winnicott, we will redefine contemporary debates by exploring their clinical meaning.

        "course_description": "\nWhile Soviet Union after the second World War is often figured as a country of \u201cstagnation,\u201d in contrast to the avant garde 1920s and the tumult of Stalin\u2019s 1930s, this figure is currently being re-evaluated. Political calm belied a rapidly changing society. The period developed a Soviet culture that was indubitably educated, modern, and mass. Despite, or within, or against the ever changing and ambiguous boundaries, censors, and dogmas, Soviet intellectuals generated cultural productions that reflected upon, processed, and critiqued the reality in which they lived and created. This course examines the development of this late Soviet \u201cintelligentsia,\u201d the first that was fully a product of Soviet society itself. Against a background of social history, we will select developments in various realms of cultural production for further examination, which from year to year may include philosophy, literature, political culture and ideology, art, and science",

The purpose of the course is to become familiar with imperial thinking, the thought (pro-empire, anti-empire, and simply permeated by empire, to put it in terms familiar to a contemporary audience) implicit in various literary works of the time. For the most part, the readings assigned are primary texts. These will be heavily supplemented during course meetings: the instructor will bring in various materials that would be obscure if assigned to students outside of class, but with live explanations in-class, will enrich their understanding of the primary readings. Most readings are literary texts, though students will also read and receive guidance in secondary academic literature about those works. A few philosophical and historical texts from the time under examination will also be assigned",

How do you write Jewish history when Jewish future seems uncertain? This course offers a survey of the literature and intellectual history written during World War II (1939-1945) both in Nazi occupied Europe and in the free world, written primarily, but not exclusively, by Jews. We will read novels, poems, science fiction, historical fiction, legal theory and social theory and explore how intellectuals around the world responded to the extermination of European Jewry as it happened and how they changed their understanding of what it means to be a public intellectual, what it means to be Jewish, and what it means to be human. The aim of the course is threefold. First, it offers a survey of the Jewish experience during WWII, in France, Russia, Poland, Latvia, Romania, Greece, Palestine, Morocco, Iraq, the USSR, Argentina, and the United States. Second, it introduces some of the major contemporary debates in holocaust studies.

Dodds in the opening anecdote of Dodds\u2019 \u2018Greeks and the Irrational\u2019. Why is the art in Greco-Roman galleries often perceived as cold and emotionless? Is a lack of emotional expression a marked feature of Greek art or is this impression due to the fact that, in our world of cinematic close-ups and emojis, we are not attuned to ancient ways of communicating emotions? The central thesis of this seminar is that there was a sophisticated ancient \u2018art\u2019 (in the ancient sense of \u2018craft\u2019) of creating feelings through non-verbal means, one shared across different visual media from sculpture and painting to theatrical and oratorical performances. Our main sources to uncover this craft will be visual representations in ancient art, from Archaic Greek art to Roman Imperial art. We will bring artistic representations into dialogue with textual sources, such ancient plays often hinting at non-verbal means of communication or rhetorical handbooks teaching how to move the audience during a political speech",

The impact of anti-humanist thinking in contemporary theory is taken as a point of departure, as a challenge that must be overcome. Hence, certain classic writings of Marx and Heidegger (and responses by Althusser, Derrida, and Said) are examined in detail in the initial 4 weeks of the course.\n\nHowever, in order to field this challenge in its full epistemological range, we will also engage with various discourses that respond to the question \u201cwhat is human?\u201d including recent discussions of animality (Derrida, Agamben, Haraway) and the exceptional challenge of feminist epistemology to traditionally gendered humanist assumptions (Irigaray, Haraway). The last third of the course examines what affirmations the question \u201cwhat is human?\u201d \u2013 though not answerable as such \u2013 mobilizes in three specific epistemological domains: psyche, pedagogy, politics. In this respect, the focus falls upon Castoriadis\u2019 monumental response to Aristotle and Freud, as well as Derrida\u2019s classic treatise on friendship. The course ends with a preliminary discussion of theories of the \u201cpost-human\u201d in cognitive science, which will resonate against the discussions in the beginning of the course.\n\nThis is a graduate course, open to exceptional senior undergraduates. A kind of basic background in Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud is assumed. The course addresses concerns of students throughout the humanities, but also certain theoretical tracks in the arts and humanistic tracks in the social sciences. It will also be of interest to students in the biological sciences, neuroscience, or cognitive science, who seek an opportunity to reflect on their disciplines from a philosophical standpoint.",

        "course_description": "\nIn 1935, WEB Dubois wrote about abolition democracy: an idea based not only on breaking down unjust systems, but on building up new, antiracist social structures. Scholar activists like Angela Davis, Ruth Gilmore and Mariame Kaba have long contended that the abolition of slavery was but one first step in ongoing abolitionist practices dismantling racialized systems of policing, surveillance and incarceration. The possibilities of prison and police abolition have recently come into the mainstream national consciousness during the 2020 resurgence of nationwide Black Lives Matters (BLM) protests. As we collectively imagine what nonpunitive and supportive community reinvestment in employment, education, childcare, mental health, and housing might look like, medicine must be a part of these conversations. Indeed, if racist violence is a public health emergency, and we are trying to bring forth a \u201cpublic health approach to public safety\u201d \u2013 what are medicine\u2019s responsibilities to these social and institutional reinventions? Medicine has a long and fraught history of racial violence. It was, after all, medicine and pseudoscientific inquiry that helped establish what we know as the racial categorizations of today: ways of separating human beings based on things like skin color and hair texture that were used (and often continue to be used) to justify the enslavement, exclusion, or genocide of one group of people by another. Additionally, the history of the professionalization of U.S. medicine, through the formation of medical schools and professional organizations as well as and the certification of trained physicians, is a history of exclusion, with a solidification of the identity of \u201cphysician\u201d around upper middle class white masculinity. Indeed, the 1910 Flexner Report, whose aim was to make consistent training across the country\u2019s medical schools, was explicit in its racism. From practices of eugenic sterilization, to histories of experimentation upon bodies of color, medicine is unfortunately built upon racist, sexist and able-ist practices. This course is built on the premise that a socially just practice of medicine is a bioethical imperative. Such a practice cannot be achieved, however, without examining medicine\u2019s histories of racism, as well as learning from and building upon histories of anti-racist health practice. The first half of the semester will be dedicated to learning about histories of medical racism: from eugenics and racist experimentation to public health xenophobic fear mongering. The second half of the semester will be dedicated to examining medical and grassroots anti-racist practices: from the free health clinics and hospital takeovers of the Black Panther and Young Lords Parties, to environmental activism in Flint and the Sioux Rock Reservation to antiracist AIDS and COVID activism",

This class studies how the arts can provide access to voices and perspectives on illness and health disparities that might be overlooked in news coverage, historical and sociological research on the current pandemic. This class begins by introducing the field of Medical/Health Humanities and the critical questions and tools it provides. We will use these perspectives to study narrative and visual representations in different media that address the intersections of social inequity, biomedical pandemic, and aesthetic forms. Our study of representations will be divided into four parts. 1.The last great global pandemic. Representations of AIDS epidemic highlight the impact of social stigma on public health and medical care, as well as the use of art as an agent of activism and change. We will consider such works as Tony Kushner\u2019s Angels in America, Charles Burns\u2019s Black Hole, short stories, and the art produced within and in response to the ACT-UP movement. 2.Race and medical inequity. We study the racialization of genetic science, and its connection new forms of white supremacy and a history of racialized health disparities. Our readings include Rebecca Skloot\u2019s Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, the poetry of Maya Angelou and Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and the speculative fiction of N.K. Jemison. 3.Fictional representations of pandemic that illuminate real life disparities in health and access to medical care will set the stage for our study of the current pandemic. We will read Emily St. John Mandel\u2019s Station Eleven and Colson Whitehead\u2019s zombie novel, Zone One. 4.Literary representations of COVID, as represented by the short stories in The Decameron Project, as well as short film and visual arts. Seminar style classes will emphasize student interests and direction. They will be heavily discussion-based with a combination of full class and smaller breakout formats. Assignments include an in-class presentation and short paper on one week\u2019s materials; a comparative narrative analysis, and an imaginative final project with a critical introduction",

Care is an ambiguous concept that always already contains or is determined by its oppositions; we will begin by analyzing the concept of care itself, drawing on resources from the history and philosophy of medicine as well as literary sources. Ideals of care that many of us have for our loved ones are difficult to render at scale, and are often in tension with the for-profit motivations behind the development of medications, the administration of healthcare services, and the distribution of goods.

        "course_description": "\nJacques Derrida was one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century and his impact on literary studies was enormously significant. The objective of this course is to take stock of Derrida\u2019s contribution to literature, and to do so by assessing the intricate relations he establishes between literature, philosophy, economic and political theory, gender studies, translation studies, postcolonial theory, and theology. The course is divided into six parts. Part 1 introduces Derrida\u2019s approach to \u2018deconstruction,\u2019 particularly as regards his engagement with the fundamental concepts of Western thought and the importance he confers upon the notion of \u2018writing\u2019 itself. Part 2 examines Derrida\u2019s autobiographical texts wherein he positions himself as a subject for deconstruction, interrogating his own gender, his sense of being an organic, creaturely life-form, the relationship he has to his own language, and the matter of his identity as French, but also as Algerian, and Jewish. While the majority of the Derrida texts we will be reading are excerpts from larger works or short essays and interviews, in this section we will read a full-length text \u2013\u00a0Monolingualism of the Other\u00a0\u2013 so that we can trace Derrida\u2019s train of thought from beginning to end. In Part 3 we will use an interview conducted by Derek Attridge, \u201cThis Strange Institution Called Literature,\u201d as a template for thinking about Derrida\u2019s relation to literature, and in Part 4 we will read our second full-length text by Derrida, namely\u00a0Given Time 1: Counterfeit Money, an in-depth analysis of a prose poem by the French poet Charles Baudelaire. Part 5 considers an aspect of Derrida\u2019s work that reveals the extent of his embrace of provisional, in-between positions for thought in general, and for literary texts in particular, namely translation. For deconstruction is keenly invested in words beginning with \u2018trans\u2019: transposition, transplant, trans-valuation, and indeed trans-gender. Translation provides Derrida with a scenario whereby crossings and transits can be imagined \u2013 for literary texts, and for identities that wish to remain un-determined by fixed poles or normative values. The course finishes with an assessment of Derrida\u2019s reflections on death, mourning, and the matter of leaving a legacy. In Part 6, we therefore read more of the essay \u201cLiving On,\u201d and also Derrida\u2019s final interview, \u201cLearning to Live, Finally.\u201d Not even Derrida could deconstruct away the finality of death, but he did hope to live on. My corresponding hope is that you will feel sufficiently attuned to Derrida\u2019s thought that you consider it important to continue his legacy \u2013 to be one of the agents of his living on, survival or\u00a0survie, a translator and transporter of his thought towards contexts that he could not have foreseen, but which he would doubtless have welcomed as a precious chance for his own work to be considered differently.\u00a0Taking intellectual risks, thinking otherwise, and inventing new ways of knowing are, after all, the hallmarks of Derridean deconstruction.",

In this workshop, we will explore translation as a praxis of writing, reading, and revision. Together, we will also interrogate translation's complex and often fraught role in cultural production. What ethical questions does translation raise? Who gets to translate, and what gets translated? What is the place of the translator in the text? What can translation teach us about language, literature, and ourselves? Readings will include selections from translation theory, method texts, and literary translations across genres, from poetry and prose to essay and memoir. Students will workshop original translations into English and complete brief writing and translation exercises throughout",

This seminar introduces students to this problem through an unspoken racial dimension of American political belonging -- the presumed whiteness of ideal American citizens. Readings drawn from several disciplinary traditions, including anthropology, linguistics, sociology, history, and journalism, will ground students in the course's key concepts, including racial markedness, the history of racialization, and public sentiment. Students will mobilize these tools to analyze several cases that rendered white sentiment explicit in politically efficacious ways, including the \"panic\" incited by the destabilization of race-based residential segregation, the \"paranoia\" of conspiracy theorists, the \"sympathy\" associated with natural disasters, and the \"resentment\" or \"rage\" associated with the loss of racial privileges",

In this course, we will explore a wide range of these Latinx lifeways. Through readings in the humanities and social sciences, we will learn how Latinxs have survived amidst and against settler colonialism and racial capitalism. Meanwhile, through the study of literature and art, we will see how Latinxs have resisted and/or reinforced these social systems. With our interdisciplinary and intersectional approach, we will determine why Latinidad has manifested differently in colonial territories (especially Puerto Rico), regional communities (especially the US\u2013Mexico borderlands), and transnational diasporas (of Cubans, of Dominicans, and of a variety of Central Americans). At the same time, we will understand how Latinxs have struggled with shared issues, such as (anti-) Blackness and (anti-)Indigeneity, gender and sexuality, citizenship and (il)legality, and economic and environmental (in)justice. During the semester, we will practice Latinx studies both collectively and individually: to enrich our in-class discussions, each student will complete a reading journal, a five- page paper, a creative project, and a digital timeline",

This was a consequence of globalization, an historical process that reconfigured the boundaries between economy, society, and culture; and it was also a primary theme of post-modernist aesthetics, which celebrated playful borrowing of multiple and diverse historical references. Within that frame, interest in the US-Mexican border shifted dramatically. Since that border is the longest and most intensively crossed boundary between a rich and a poor country, it became a paradigmatic point of reference. Places like Tijuana or El Paso, with their rather seedy reputation, had until then been of interest principally to local residents, but they now became exemplars of post-modern \u201chybridity,\u201d and were meant to inspire the kind of transnational scholarship that is required in today\u2019s world.

In this course we will ask the question: How do authoritarian governments influence the arts, and how do artists respond? We will study how socially committed filmmakers have subverted and redefined cinema aesthetics to challenge authoritarianism and repression. In addition, we will look at how some filmmakers respond to institutional oppression, such as poverty and corruption, even within so-called \u201cfree\u201d societies. The focus is on contemporary filmmakers but will also include earlier classics of world cinema to provide historical perspective. The course will discuss these topics, among others: What is authoritarianism, what is totalitarianism, and what are the tools of repression within authoritarian/totalitarian societies? What is Third Cinema, and how does it represent and challenge authoritarianism? How does film navigate the opposition of censorship, propaganda and truth? How do filmmakers respond to repressive laws concerning gender and sexual orientation? How do they deal with violence and trauma? How are memories of repressive regimes reflected in the psyche of modern cinema? And finally, what do we learn about authority, artistic vision, and about ourselves when we watch these films?",

We focus on the basic stance, the ardha-mandi, along with the technique of stamping as exemplified in the series of adavu, (basic combinations of hand, foot and rhythmic movement.) Following the progressive difficulty of the adavu system itself, more challenging combinations of hand and footwork will be introduced. Head and eye techniques will be introduced first in isolation then in combination. The last stage of this class involves learning a short abstract dance to music especially pre-recorded for a particular version of a dance genre and adjusted for difficulty level.

We will use the intersecting lenses of gender/sexuality, class and race/ethnicity to analyze the dramatic new inequalities created in arguably the largest and fastest accumulation of residential-real estate wealth in history. We will examine topics such as how skyrocketing home prices and state-led urbanization have created winners and losers based on gender, sexuality, class, race/ethnicity and location (hukou), as China strives to transform from a predominantly rural population to one that is 60 percent urban by 2020. We explore the vastly divergent effects of urban real-estate development on Chinese citizens, from the most marginaliz4d communities in remote regions of Tibet and Xinjiang to hyper-wealthy investors in Manhattan.

Avoiding reductionist understandings of desire as either a universal natural human attribute or a particular Chinese cultural trait, we will track the production and management of desire within a complex global field. Drawing on ethnographies, films, short stories, and psychoanalytic and postcolonial theory, this course will explore the shifting figure of desire across the Maoist and post-Maoist eras by examining how academics, government officials, intellectuals, and artists have represented Chinese needs, wants and fantasies. From state leaders\u2019 attempts to improve the \u201cquality\u201d of the country\u2019s population to citizens\u2019 dreams of home ownership, from sexualized desire to hunger for food, drugs and other commodities, we will attend to the continuities and disjunctures of recent Chinese history by tracking how desire in China has been conceptualized and refracted through local and global encounters",

Our analysis of the practices, discourses, and representations of hells in East Asia is designed to coincide with a major exhibition on Asian Hells at Asia Society NY (Sept-Dec 2020).

Next, the supply-side of the economy is examined with special attention to the labor market, wage setting and price setting behavior. The Phillips Curve (PC) introduces the tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment, and the role of expectations for inflation dynamics. The integrated IS-LM-PC model is then used to evaluate macroeconomic policies that aim at stabilizing the economy with output produced at its potential level and the inflation rate at the central bank target. The recent episode of high inflation is simulated with a proper numerical calibration of the IS-LM-PC model",

This course will introduce students to the fundamental concepts of causal inference and expose them to several contemporary econometric tools employed in an effort to make some of the aforementioned claims more credible. With randomized controlled trials (RCTs) serving as the gold standard for empirical work, students will learn how many econometric techniques and \u201cnatural\u201d experiments attempt to emulate the best characteristics of well-executed RCTs. In addition to problem sets and an in-class midterm exam, students will carry out a group research project on a topic of their choosing (in consultation with the professor) in order to demonstrate their proficiency in several key course concepts. This project remains critical to learning the scholastic (and practical) challenges in making rigorous causal claims, navigating the logistics of group collaboration, and learning how to critically evaluate empirical work",

We can think of most everyday interactions as games, and game theory offers us a systematic way to think about these interactions. Scholars in various disciplines, including economics, business, psychology, political science, and linguistics have applied game theory to study behavior in different contexts. This course has two parts. The first part will introduce you to the tools needed to analyze strategic interaction formally. You will learn a methodology to understand simultaneous, sequential, and repeated interaction with complete and incomplete information. Examples and applications will illustrate solution concepts developed for cooperative and non-cooperative games.

Economics is about individual choice subject to constraints and the ways that choices sum up to something often much more than the parts. The fundamental feature of any city is the combination of those forces that bring people together and those that push them apart. Thus both physical and social space will be central to our discussions. The underlying theoretical and empirical analysis will touch on spatial aspects of urban economics, regional, and even international economics. We will aim to see these features in New York City taken as a whole, as well as in specific neighborhoods of the city. We will match these theoretical and empirical analyses with readings that reflect close observation of specific subjects. The close observation is meant to inspire you to probe deeply into a topic in order that the tools and approaches of economics may illuminate these issues in a fresh way",

Economic development is a complex and multifaceted process. Once considered a goal in itself, more recently it has become to be viewed as the fundamental means to world poverty alleviation. Today, about half of the world population still lives on less than $2 /day. Why? What does it mean to be poor? What are the forces that prevent so many people from enjoying a higher standard of living? The course opens on some fundamental macroeconomic models of economic growth and the recent debate on the geographical or institutional nature of the ultimate causes of growth or arrested development. Then we will move into the most recent microeconomic literature that sheds light on the lives of the poor and on the forces - in particular the market distortions and the market failures - that keep billions in poverty. Among others, we will discuss interesting topics like nutrition and health, the cultural origins of corruption, the effect of global warming, and the design of effective anti-poverty programs",

Another set of pressures are to find approaches to incentivize corporations to meet the goals set out in the Paris Treaty of 2015. These approaches include (1) mandates or restrictions to only hold companies with decarbonization plans, (2) development of negative emissions technologies such as direct-air capture and (3) promotion of natural capital markets that can be used to offset carbon emissions. Moreover, financial markets also provide crucial information on expectations and plans of economic agents regarding climate change.

In many cases, this provides a good approximation to the types of behavior that economists are interested in. However, over the past 30 years, experimental and behavioral economists have documented ways in which the standard model is not just wrong, but is wrong in ways that are important for economic outcomes. Understanding these behaviors, and their implications, is one of the most exciting areas of current economic inquiry. The aim of this course is to provide a grounding in the main areas of study within behavioral economics, including temptation and self control, fairness and reciprocity, reference dependence, bounded rationality and choice under risk and uncertainty. For each area we will study three things: 1. The evidence that indicates that the standard economic model is missing some important behavior 2. The models that have been developed to capture these behaviors 3. Applications of these models to (for example) finance, labor and development economics As well as the standard lectures, homework assignments, exams and so on, you will be asked to participate in economic experiments, the data from which will be used to illustrate some of the principals in the course. There will also be a certain small degree of classroom \u2018flipping\u2019, with a portion of many lectures given over to group problem solving.

The standard model of economic behavior describes a perfectly rational, self interested utility maximizer with unlimited cognitive resources. In many cases, this provides a good approximation to the types of behavior that economists are interested in. However, over the past 30 years, experimental and behavioral economists have documented ways in which the standard model is not just wrong, but is wrong in ways that are important for economic outcomes. Understanding these behaviors, and their implications, is one of the most exciting areas of current economic inquiry. This course will study three important topics within behavioral economics: Bounded rationality, temptation and self control and reference dependent preferences.

        "course_description": "\nBeing young can often mean being (or feeling) powerless, particularly within the large institutions that structure youth\u2019s lives. Couple this with experiences of marginalization due to race, class, gender, or other social identities, and young people may experience profound constraints in their choices or pathways. At the same time, youth \u2013 both individually and in groups \u2013 often develop strategies to resist these sources of literal and figurative confinement to seek out dignity, joy, and justice. Using sociological and ethnographic texts as our foundation, this course will explore the way experiences of confinement and constraint show up in the lives of young people, particularly as they move through educational institutions \u2013 and how youth work to resist those forms of subordination. In the first half of the semester, we will focus on policing and prisons and examine the ways schools play a role in funneling youth into different forms of confinement. In the second half of the semester, we will investigate college and college preparatory contexts in an effort to understand the ways they may constrain opportunities by creating or foreclosing particular pathways for students\u2019 futures. Throughout the semester, we will emphasize the role of socially constructed identity categories \u2013 race, gender, class, in particular, as well as the category of youth itself \u2013 in these processes of confinement and constraint. We will also highlight youth and community practices of resistance against these social and institutional forces. Along the way, we will consider (and practice) the affordances and limitations of ethnography as a mode of social research for studying confinement, constraint, and practices of resistance in educational contexts. LEARNING OBJECTIVES Through this course, students will: \u25cf Use a range of sociological, ethnographic, and multimodal texts to analyze youth\u2019s experiences of confinement, constraint, and resistance (expansively defined) and the ways they play out in different institutional, educational, and social contexts. \u25cf Explore the methodological approach of ethnography \u2013 its affordances, challenges, and some of the major dilemmas in the field \u2013 and practice it by conducting a series of scaffolded ethnographic projects. \u25cf Write for multiple purposes, including exploratory and dialogic writing shared with peers, persuasive writing for a public audience (op-ed), analytical writing based on original ethnographic research, and collaborative writing (and presenting). \u25cf Recognize and investigate the ways confinement and constraint show up in their own lives and social contexts, particularly in college",

This seminar will explore the following questions: What is globalization and why is it leading to new patterns of migration? How do children and youth experience ruptures and continuities across contexts of migration? How do language policies affect young people\u2019s capacity to be educated in a new land? What does it mean to forge a sense of belonging and citizenship in a \u201cglobalized\u201d world, and how does this challenge our models of national citizenship?

The Seminar in Urban Education explores the historical, political and socio-cultural dynamics of urban education in the U.S. context. Over time, a range of social actors have intervened in the \u201cproblem\u201d of urban education, attempting to reshape and reform urban schools. Others have disputed this \u201cproblem\u201d focused approach, arguing that policy makers, teachers, and researchers should start from the strengths and capacities located in urban communities. Despite decades of wide ranging reform efforts, however, many urban schools still fail to provide their students with an adequate, equitable education. Seminar in Urban Education investigates this paradox by pursuing three central course questions: 1) How have various social actors tried to achieve equity in urban schools over time? 2) What are the range and variation of assets and challenges found in urban schools? and 3) Considering this history and context, what would effective reform in a global city like NYC look like?

Course participants will have an opportunity to gain an understanding of concepts and practices appropriate for K-12 students as they explore the New York State Learning Standards. As we explore the multitude of opportunities for teaching computer science in New York City, we will also take into consideration the diversity of the students that course participants teach or are preparing to teach. We will examine the social and political contexts that learning and teaching happen in, and consider the implications of these contexts for different groups of students. As participants develop an understanding of what it means to be literate in computer science, they will explore ways to make computer science education more meaningful and accessible to all students by infusing it with students\u2019 daily and cultural experiences. We will explore notions of social justice and the implications for teaching computer science for social justice by addressing barriers to engagement, persistence, and achievement in mathematics. Working in teams to plan for Computer Science Enrichment lessons, participants will explore ways to teach computer science using a constructivist approach while being responsive to the demands of the NYS Next Generation Standards, Universal Design for Learning (UDL), growth mindsets, critiques of growth mindsets, and tenets of justice and caring. Participants will also have an opportunity to build positive computer science mindsets for themselves and for K-12 students as they engage in experiential learning, plan for Computer Science Enrichment sessions that incorporate ways to visualize and communicate computer science content and skills, and evaluate the efficacy of their planning and teaching in light of their students\u2019 learning outcomes",

        "course_description": "\nThe rise in political polarization and social inequality over the past few decades has challenged the ideals that public schools were founded on nearly two centuries ago. In the past few years, we have witnessed a surge in homophobic, racist, misogynist, and xenophobic rhetoric in our society and our schools. At the same time, teachers in classrooms across this country have been engaged in the difficult work of challenging oppression and injustice in their schools, communities, and nation. These teachers know that the future of our democracy is at stake. Using a historical and sociological framework, this course examines the past and present conditions that have led to political polarization, escalating inequality, and persistent injustice. It seeks to examine the lineage of racism, sexism, nativism, and imperialism on our nation and its schools and to consider the extent to which these challenges are uniquely American or part of a more global phenomenon. It offers an introduction to the deep current of American social, political, and economic culture that many argue has produced the challenges that our nation faces today: personal and political gain marred by intolerance, derived from wealth, and rooted in the history of segregation, sexism, and exploitation. Instead of seeing these challenges as separate entities, the course acknowledges the intersectional nature of power and politics. Students will consider how these conditions affect their roles as educators and the lives of the youth and families in their schools and communities. They will leave the course with a deeper appreciation and understanding of the historical and sociological antecedents that have contributed to polarization, inequity, and injustice around the globe",

Learning to use and interpret genomic information, however, remains challenging for many students, as it requires synthesizing knowledge from a range of disciplines, including genetics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Although genomics is of broad interest to many fields, such as ecology, evolutionary biology, genetics, medicine, and computer science, students in these areas often lack sufficient background training to take a genomics course. This course bridges this gap, by teaching skills in modern genomic technologies that will allow students to innovate and effectively apply these tools in novel applications across disciplines. To achieve this, we implement an active learning approach to emphasize genomics as a data science, and use this organizing principle to structure the course around computational exercises, lab-based activities using state-of-the-art sequencing instruments,case studies, and field work. Together, this approach will introduce students to the principles of genomics by allowing them to generate, analyze, and interpret data hands-on while using the most cutting-edge genomic technologies of today in a stimulating and engaging learning experience.",

        "course_description": "\nPrerequisites: Introductory Biology. Earth Science and one course in ecology recommended. Treelines are the boundaries between forests and low stature alpine and tundra vegetation, thought to be controlled by climate and therefore likely to respond to climate change. In 1807 Alexander von Humboldt and Aim\u00e9 Bonpland described treeline as a global phenomenon and a bioclimatological reference that all other vegetation could be referenced against. Despite being clearly linked to climate, the mechanisms that control treeline formation and persistence remain an active area of scientific research and debate. The lack of a complete mechanistic understanding of how climate controls the location of treeline opens the important question of how treeline will respond to climate change. Furthermore, while physical site characteristics determine the potential location of treeline, trees may be absent for a variety of factors, complicating the predicted ecosystem response to a changing climate. These factors include local peculiarities of the environment, a regional lack of capable species, or a multitude of disturbances, including those caused by humans. This course is focused on the ecology treeline in light of global climate change and will provide students with a foundational understanding of fundamental ecological concepts as they pertain to this important ecological boundary between ecosystems and biomes. In addition, students will learn to (1) find, read, and discuss the primary scientific literature, and (2) communicate their findings via written, oral, and audio-visual formats.

Examining novels, short stories, and films, the course will ask students to reflect on how aesthetic representations of exile complicate notions of home, belonging, sovereignty, and identity. Beginning with the birth of the modern refugee after World War II, with its legal and political consolidation by the UN 1951 Refugee Convention, we will discuss several dimensions of displacement and the ways in which these are differently experienced by individuals. We will move from scenes of interminable bureaucratic stasis in post-war Europe to depictions of border crossings along the Mexico-US border, will hear the voices of Iranian women alongside those of Vietnamese American writers working to articulate complex identities, and much more. While examining this constellation of diverse materials, we will attend both to the historical and political specificity of each as well as to productive points of convergence that they share by asking: \uf0b7 What do we understand to be the possibilities and limitations of art in portraying the experience of refugees, exiles, and migrants? \uf0b7 How has exile become one of the central metaphors of modernity, and what does this universalism bring to the fore and elide? \uf0b7 How can aesthetic representation challenge popular depictions of refugees as innocent supplicants in need of empathy and instead refigure them as political actors? \uf0b7 How do these complicated texts reinforce and contest narratives that depict forced migration as a linear movement from unstable peripheries to stable centers?",

This course will explore the entanglement of literature and the environment from two vantage points: the first is Romantic-era England, which coincided with the onset of the industrial revolution that put the earth on a course of mass extinction and climate change. The second is the period from around 1980 to the present, after the birth of the modern environmental movement, when the devastating effects of human activity on the earth became an unavoidable subject for many poets. After spending time with both canonical and overlooked Romantic nature poetry (including Wordsworth, Charlotte Smith, Shelley, John Clare), we will turn in the second half of the semester to a global group of contemporary eco-poets variously taking up, transforming, deflecting, or unraveling Romantic-era ideas of \u201cNature\u201d in light of contemporary environmental crises and the age of the Anthropocene. The course will focus on close reading and discussion of poems, but will also introduce some elementary concepts, concerns, and practices of what is called \u201ceco-criticism,\u201d a relatively recent mode of reading literature first developed by scholars of Romanticism. Some questions we may consider include: How might poetic language be particularly attuned to intimations of ecological change and collapse? How do and how should poetic forms and traditions shift in the wake of environmental crisis? How might poems help us cultivate arts of noticing, forms of resistance, and modes of dwelling in common with non-human life? Reading contemporary poets like Will Alexander and Etel Adnan, we will also explore how literature can connect with various scales and dimensions of existence, including the seasonal, the elemental, the planetary, and even the cosmic. Along the way, we will critically explore how both ecology and poetic practice are inflected by issues of race, gender, sexuality, and capitalism",

In the Enlightenment colloquium we will look at English and European imaginative and intellectual life during the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. During this period, writers tried in new ways to reconcile the tensions between reason and religion. Categories of thought that underlie our world today were taking shape: secularity, progress, the public and the private, individual rights, religious tolerance. Writers articulated principles of equality in an era of slavery. Literary forms like the novel, which emerges into prominence during this period, express in irreducibly complex ways these and other changes. In this intensive course, we will study from multiple angles a variety of authors that may include Hobbes, Dryden, Locke, Spinoza, Lafayette, Defoe, Swift, Pope, Richardson, Voltaire, Fielding, Johnson, Diderot, Sterne, and Wollstonecraft, among others",

        "course_description": "\nJohn Donne is the most famous \u201cMetaphysical Poet\u201d of the 17th century. The term \u201cmetaphysical\u201d to refer to his poetry was first used by Samuel Johnson in the 18th century. It was popularized in the 20th century by T. S. Eliot, who lamented what he called a \u201cdissociation of sensibility\u201d that set in during the 17th century, whereas (Eliot said) \u201ca thought to Donne was an experience,\u201d as if mind was not simply a separate thing from embodied experience. Donne\u2019s poetry has long been admired, indeed loved, embraced by later readers, writers, and artists\u2014not just in England and America but in different parts of the world. He has left a rich legacy, and what Judith Scherer Herz calls his \u201cvoiceprint\u201d on diverse later writers. In my experience, students always want to spend more time on Donne. In this course, we will do that, reading his poetry with attention but also his prose Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions, written in 1623 during the plague when he came close to dying. The Devotions found a new life during the AIDs crisis, and then again during our Covid pandemic. The line from the Devotions that begins \u201cNo man is an island\u201d has been part of our culture for a century, though many have no idea where it comes from. In this course, we will engage in \u201cattentive,\u201d patient reading of his texts, entering in them, trying to figuring them out, much as Donne sought to figure out lived experience in richly metaphorical writing. Though Donne is at the center of the course, we will also read a selection of poems by other 17th-century Metaphysical poets\u2014George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, Katherine Philips, Andrew Marvell\u2014and Sir Thomas Browne\u2019s prose Hydriotaphia: Or Urn Burial, occasioned by the excavation of ancient burial urns discovered in Norwich. Browne tries to figure out the identity of these urns, then moves to a fascinating survey of the burial practices of different cultures over a long period of time, and then concludes with a profound meditation on memory, legacy, and our desire for immortality, perpetuating our earthly connections. Donne left an impression on so many writers such as Yeats, Dylan Thomas, and Seamus Heaney; Emily Dickinson, Elizabeth Bishop, and Adrienne Rich; Djuna Barnes (her novel Nightwood, a lesbian classic), Robert Lowell and Anthony Hecht, the Bengali Rabinadrath Tagore; Joseph Brodsky, Yehudah Amichai and Leonard Cohen; Linda Gregerson, and Kimberly Johnson. So many possibilities for anyone interested in exploring beyond the limits of syllabus. Donne\u2019s poetry has had (and continues to have) a transhistorical and transcultural currency. This course begins to opening up possibilities, as we think about how and why we read imaginative literature from the past",

Against the supposed supremacy of rational consciousness, he found the power of the unconscious. At the heart of civilized order, he uncovered ever more sophisticated mechanisms of repression. Where the world saw the march of progress, he saw the death drive. And he discovered all of this through a new invention, a science of narrative, called psychoanalysis. According to this science, we are the stories we tell. And this means that we, our lives, our joys and anxieties, our past and our future, are like any story: always open to interpretation. In this course, we turn this lens back upon psychoanalysis, opening its clinical history and fundamental concepts to critical, literary interpretation. Beginning with Freud but moving beyond him, we will read foundational psychoanalytic texts alongside plays, poetry, novels, short stories, and films that corroborate, complicate, and contest the Freudian framework. We will consider the intrinsically literary qualities of psychoanalysis and, inversely, we will ask what literature, literary criticism, and literary theory gain or lose in this critical relation to psychoanalysis",

What made the Victorian novel such a fertile form for grappling with the unprecedented cultural changes of the nineteenth century? To address this question, we will explore how Victorian novels both responded to, and participated in, major social and cultural shifts of the period, including industrialism and urbanization; colonialism and empire; the changing status of women, sexuality, and marriage; the emergence of Darwinism; class conflict and social reform; and the expansion of education and literacy. This course will also consider more broadly what novels are for, and what the Victorians thought they were for. Do novels represent the world as it really is, or do they imagine it as it ought to be? What kinds of solutions to social and political problems can novels offer? Can novels ethically improve (or corrupt) their readers? We will consider these issues in the context of realism, Victorian literature\u2019s trademark genre, but we\u2019ll also explore an array of other genres, such as the industrial novel, the Bildungsroman, the sensation novel, detective fiction, and gothic fiction.

The test of authenticity for one reading community might be a book's perceived difference from that community's own experience; for another community (usually the one the author is perceived as coming from), the same book must represent a familiar experience to pass the test. Some questions we will address: How might \"ethnic\" writing and production both expose itself to and insulate itself from critique via claims to authenticity? How does an author negotiate others' demands for a certain kind of authenticity, and his or her own deeply felt (authentic?) need to consolidate identity by returning to ethnic \u201corigins\u201d?

How did these heterogeneous communities differently diagnose the context of colonialism? What positive horizons of freedom, equality, and democracy did they aspire towards? What do their works tell us about gender, land, and labor? We explore themes of sovereignty against settler colonialism in the work of indigenous writers like Kandiaronk, William Apess, E. Pauline Johnson, Sarah Winnemucca, Zitkala Sa, and Liliuokalani, Queen of Hawaii. Next, we read the African American abolitionist tradition, beginning with Phillis Wheatley and slave narratives (Frederick Douglass, Mary Prince, Harriet Jacobs) followed by works by Harriet Wilson, Ida B.

Focusing on a different play each week, we will ask: what does it take, ultimately, to believe women about their fidelity? At the same time, what is the effect of being doubted on women themselves? We will also give consideration to the particular resources of dramatic form, paying attention to moments in plays that coerce spectators themselves into mistaken judgments about women. We will supplement our reading of drama with pamphlets, advice literature, poems, church court cases, and ballads, in order to place these plays within a broader and more varied culture of female surveillance in early modern England. Finally, we will work to recover past strategies of liberation from this surveillance in the plays we read, in women\u2019s writing that warns against male betrayal, and in dramatic and historical instances of female cross-dressing",

        "course_description": "\nA host of developments in the art cultures of nineteenth-century Europe and America prompted a widespread, manifold debate about the nature and function of art and aesthetic experience. Expanding access to art in great public collections and exhibitions, which offered newly immediate and arresting contact with artworks, left many viewers in a puritanical culture grappling with the sheer power of these works. What sort of satisfactions did these images afford? Were the pleasures they aroused in some way dangerous, at odds with conventional morality and belief, even with the values ostensibly inherent in the images they presented? How might those provocations by received by different portions of an increasingly large and variegated audience? Might their challenges to convention be a stimulus to new modes of organizing life and experience, both personal and social? Or was their cultivation a symptom of social decadence or decline?\n\nThese challenges were taken up in a wide and varied array of literature and art that has become known as \u201caestheticism.\u201d This seminar focuses on the development of aestheticism in England, with glances at France and America, over the period of roughly 1830-1900. We\u2019ll begin with early poetic musings on the moral burdens of art and the artist\u2019s relations to society, particularly in the works of Tennyson and Browning. These works also introduce a recurrent preoccupation of the course, the power of art and aesthetic pleasure to unsettle conventional norms of gender and sexuality. We\u2019ll then move to an array of critical reflection prompted by the new prominence of visual art in England, most notably John Ruskin\u2014the single most influential of all English art critics\u2014and Walter Pater, whose 1873 volume, The Renaissance, became the most important text of English aestheticism (Oscar Wilde called it \u201cthe Golden Book\u201d; George Eliot pronounced it \u201cpoisonous\u201d). We\u2019ll see these concerns further developed in mid-century painting, most notably the aesthetic movement known as \u201cPre-Raphaelitism,\u201d and a host of poetry associated with the movement (D.G. Rossetti was a major figure as both a painted and a poet). The work of Ruskin and William Morris directed aesthetic reflection towards reflection on labor and social reform, which flourished in the ideals attached to the \u201cArts & Crafts\u201d movement near the end of the century. The career of Oscar Wilde captures the increasing visibility of aestheticism, both as it became affiliated with varieties of commodity culture, and as it aroused increasing hostility, some of it satiric, some of it deeply threatened by Wilde\u2019s moral provocations, above all his homosexuality. Finally we\u2019ll read two important novels that register the impact of aestheticism, Wilde\u2019s The Picture of Dorian Gray and Henry James\u2019s The Tragic Muse.",

        "course_description": "\nThis course explores how American women writers who suffered from depression, disability, bodily pain, or social marginalization, used the environment and its literary representations to redefine the categories of gender, ability, and personhood. Prior to their inclusion into the public sphere through the US Constitution\u2019s 19th Amendment which in 1920 granted women the right to vote, American artists had to be particularly resourceful in devising apt strategies to counter the political and aesthetic demands that had historically dispossessed them of the voice, power, and body. This course focuses on the women writers who conceptualized their own surroundings (home, house, marriage, country, land, island and the natural world) as an agent that actively and decisively participates in the construction and dissolution of personal identity. In doing so, they attempted to annul the separation of the public (politics) and the private (home) as respective male and female spheres, and in this way they contributed, ahead of their own time, to the suffragist debates. Our task in this course will be to go beyond the traditional critical dismissal of these emancipatory strategies as eccentric or \u201cmerely aesthetic\u201d and therefore inconsequential. Instead, we will take seriously Rowlandson\u2019s frontier diet, Fuller\u2019s peculiar cure for her migraines, Wheatley\u2019s oblique references to the Middle Passage, Jewett\u2019s islands, \u0160a\u2019s time-travel, Thaxter\u2019s oceans, Hurston\u2019s hurricanes, and Sansay\u2019s scathing portrayal of political revolutions. We will read these portrayals as aesthetic decisions that had\u2014and continue to have\u2014profound political consequences: by externalizing and depersonalizing what is commonly understood to be internal and intimate, the authors we read collapse the distinction between inside and outside, between the private and public\u2014the distinction that traditionally excluded women from participation in the public life, in policy- and decision-making",

        "course_description": "\nSince the 1974 publication of the first anthology of Asian American writing, Aiiieeeee!, the field of Asian American Studies has been pulled in two different directions, simultaneously trying to articulate a coherent identity of, and place for, Asian American subjects while also articulating this coherence in relation to immigrant labor and history. This introductory course will survey the way this tension, between personal coherence and collective historical experience, formally characterizes Asian American media and literature since the 1970s, in which the form of the personal essay is critically expanded and brought into conflict with the racialized history of Asian American immigrant experience. Beginning with Lisa Lowe\u2019s Immigrant Acts (1994) and Colleen Lye\u2019s America\u2019s Asia (2005), this course will furnish students with an understanding of both the successive exclusion acts applied to different waves of East and Southeast Asian immigration to the United States, as well as the ways these exclusion acts produced, and were produced by, expanding forms of anti-Asian American racism. This framework of economic policy and racial form will then be used as a lens to investigate prominent texts across the Asian American canon (as well as outside of this canon) by authors such as Frank Chin, MaxineHong Kingston, Carlos Bulosan, John Okada, Theresa Cha, Jessica Hagedorn, Wilfrido Nolledo, and Elaine Castillo",

Through detailed analysis of Emerson\u2019s Essays we will try to understand his philosophy as an effort to radically reformulate traditional concepts of identity, thinking, and everyday living, and investigate the politics that guided his philosophical efforts, especially his stance on slavery and his activism against the Cherokee removals. But we will also be interested in his thinking on dreams, visions and mental transports and in order to ask how those experiences come to model his understanding of personal identity and bodily integrity. In Thoreau, we will look closely into ideas about the art of living and his theory of architecture, as well as quotidian practices of dwelling, eating or cooking, as ways to come to terms with one\u2019s own life. We will pay special attention to Thoreau\u2019s understanding of thinking as walking, as well as the question of space vs. time and we will spend a lot of time figuring his theory of living as mourning. With Whitman we will attend to his new poetics and investigate its relation to forms of American Democracy. We will also want to know how the Civil War affected Whitman\u2019s poetics both in terms of its formal strategies and its content. Finally, we will try to understand how ideas and values of transcendentalist philosophy fashion poetry of Emily Dickinson both in its form and its content.

The legal and economic entity of the corporation established new social hierarchies and systems of power, changed the roles of government and families, and wrought new forms of relationships between individuals. American culture demonstrated both an enchantment with the possibilities of a growing economy and a looming anxiety about the systematization of personal relationships.

Symbolic of the strange proximity of the divine in numerous different religious and literary traditions, trees figure as alter-egos or doubles for human lives and after-lives (in figures like the trees of life and salvation, trees of wisdom and knowledge, genealogical trees). As prostheses of thought and knowledge, they become synonymous with structure and form, supports for linguistic and other genres of mapping, and markers of organization and reading. As key sources of energy, trees \u2013as we know them today -- are direct correlates with the rise of the Anthropocene. Trees are thus both shadows and shade: that is, they are coerced doubles of the human and as entry ways to an other-world that figure at the limits of our ways of defining thought and language. By foregrounding how deeply embedded trees are in world-wide forms of self-definition and cultural expression, this course proposes a deeper understanding of the way in which the environment is a limit-figure in the humanities\u2019 relation to its \u201cnatural\u201d others. This course assumes that the \u201creal\u201d and the \u201cliterary\u201d are not opposed to one another, but are intimately co-substantial. To think \u201cclimate\u201d or \u201cenvironment\u201d is not merely a matter of the sciences, rather, it is through looking at how the humanities situates \u201cthe tree\u201d as a means of self-definition that we can have a more thorough understanding of our current ecological, political, and social climate. Foregrounding an interdisciplinary approach to literary studies, this course includes material from eco-criticism, philosophy, religion, art history, indigenous and cultural and post-colonial studies. It will begin by coupling medieval literary texts with theoretical works, but will expand (and contract) to other time periods and geographic locales",

How do critics balance the desire to say something fresh vis-a-vis the desire to say something sensible and true? What mix of traditional and innovative tools will best serve you as a critical writer? Voice, narrative, form, language, history, theory and the practice known as \u201cclose reading\u201d will be considered in a selection of exemplary critical readings. Readings will also include \u201chow-to\u201d selections from recent guides including Amitava Kumar\u2019s Every Day I Write the Book, Eric Hayot\u2019s The Elements of Academic Style and Aaron Ritzenberg and Sue Mendelsohn\u2019s How Scholars Write.

        "course_description": "\nIn this Columbia seminar taught at Queen Mary University of London during the Fall 2024 semester, we will study how 20th- and 21st-century writers have imagined and re-imagined England\u2019s capital city. Cities are made out of wood, stone, metal, plastic, and earth; they encompass human and animal, vegetation and construction, rivers and sewers, wasteland and pasture, valley and street. But cities are also spaces of representation; our experience of urban space is shaped by symbols, codes, images, and narratives. By reading literature written in and about London, we\u2019ll study how writers have imagined and re-imagined London\u2019s past, present, and future. Beyond centuries of tradition and the trappings of empire, what revolutionary narratives and possibilities does London contain? We\u2019ll explore that question by reading literary works written by famous authors such as Arthur Conan Doyle, Zadie Smith, and Virginia Woolf, as well as less-familiar texts by the likes of Samuel Selvon and Isabel Waidner. Readings and disucssions will be broken down into three broad topics. First, in the section of the class titled \u201cCriminal/Occult,\u201d we\u2019ll examine London from the point of view of criminals, detectives, and the denizens of various underworlds, natural and supernatural. Next, in \u201cFreedom of the City.\u201d we ask about the liberties the city affords (and denies) to women, immigrants, and the young. Finally, in \u201c(Sub)urban!\u201d we investigate the making and unmaking of urban life from the perspective of its edges\u2014those neighborhoods where the city bleeds into its others, or in which the traces of an earlier world persist beneath modern streets. Collectively and individually, our readings will introduce us to an old and intransigent city of walls, laws, and hierarchies\u2014and to a living metropolis endlessly made and remade by human labor and the human imagination. They reveal a city that, to borrow from Mi\u00e9ville, is both London and UnLondon. Because this class is an experiment in the site-specific study of literature, our weekly seminar meetings will be supplemented by regular field trips and urban activities. We will, for instance, undertake our own d\u00e9rive, a kind of unplanned walk that Guy Debord described as \u201ca mode of experimental behavior linked to the conditions of urban society: a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances.\u201d We will take planned walking tours around the sites narrated in novels by Woolf and Peter Ackroyd, and we will visit museums and research centers dedicated to urban life, such as the Museum of London, Black Culture Archives, and Bow Street Police Museum. The exact itinerary of visits will be determined closer to fall 2024 and will include some field trips unrelated to the class, including theatre trips, art events, and visits to historic sites such as Greenwich Observatory and Hampton Court Palace",

As the great imperial powers of Britain, France, and Belgium, among others, ceded self-rule to the colonies they once controlled, formerly colonized subjects engaged in passionate discussion about the shape of their new nations not only in essays and pamphlets but also in fiction, poetry, and theatre. Despite the common goal of independence, the heated debates showed that the postcolonial future was still up for grabs, as the boundary lines between and within nations were once again redrawn. Even such cherished notions as nationalism were disputed, and thinkers like the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore sounded the alarm about the pitfalls of narrow ethnocentric thinking. Their call for a philosophy of internationalism went against the grain of ethnic and racial particularism, which had begun to take on the character of national myth. The conflict of perspectives showed how deep were the divisions among the various groups vying to define the goals of the postcolonial nation, even as they all sought common cause in liberation from colonial rule. Nowhere was this truer than in India. The land that the British rulers viewed as a test case for the implementation of new social philosophies took it upon itself to probe their implications for the future citizenry of a free, democratic republic. We will read works by Indian writers responding to decolonization and, later, globalization as an invitation to rethink the shape of their societies. Beginning as a movement against imperial control, anti-colonialism also generated new discussions about gender relations, secularism and religious difference, the place of minorities in the nation, the effects of partition on national identity, among other issues. With the help of literary works and historical accounts, this course will explore the challenges of imagining a post-imperial society in a globalized era without reproducing the structures and subjectivities of the colonial state. Writers on the syllabus include Rabindranath Tagore, M.K. Gandhi, B.R. Ambedkar, Mulk Raj Anand, Raja Rao, Mahasweta Devi, Bapsi Sidwa, Rohinton Mistry, Amitav Ghosh, and Arundhati Roy.

Who owns Shakespeare? How radically can a play be refashioned and still be considered in conversation with his work? Is it useful to divide adaptations into those that resist or write back against Shakespeare and those that display a less conflicted relationship to his authority? What political work do adaptations do in the contexts in which they were written? What happens to those local roots and contexts when productions and films enter global networks of distribution and interpretation? How does a change in medium, say from theater to film to comic book, affect the appropriation process?

Taking a cue from the sociologist and historian Orlando Patterson, who writes that \u201cfreedom is one those of values better experienced than defined,\u201d this seminar will explore the variegated experiences of freedom and its opposites in the literature of British Romanticism. Romanticism unfolds alongside major revolutions in America, France, and Haiti, and we will begin by examining how the differing conceptions of freedom offered in the wake of these revolutions and their receptions galvanized writers and thinkers in Britain. From here, we will probe the expressions, possibilities, implications, and limits of freedom as outlined in various domains: political, individual, aesthetic, economic, philosophical, religious, and beyond. In situating Romanticism alongside developments like revolution, the rise of globalization, and the Atlantic slave trade, we will be particularly interested in confronting how the explosion of claims to freedom in this period emerges together with and in response to the proliferation of enslaved, colonized, and otherwise constrained or hindered bodies. As we read poems, novels, slave narratives, philosophical essays, political tracts and documents, and more, a fundamental question for the course will concern the relation between binary terms: to what extent, and how, do notions of freedom in Romanticism depend on the necessary exclusion of the unfree? Since the Romantic age sees the birth of concepts of freedom still prevalent in our own day, this course will offer an opportunity to reflect critically on the present. To that end, we will take up some contemporary theoretical analyses and critiques of freedom, both directly in relation to Romanticism and reaching beyond",

If England\u2019s dreaming in 1977 looked like a dead-end, how do we dream of futures in a moment so much closer to the reality of worlds\u2019 end? In this class, we will read a range of ambiguous utopias and dystopias (to use a term from Ursula LeGuin) and explore various models of temporality, a range of fantasies of apocalypse and a few visions of futurity. While some critics, like Frederick Jameson, propose that utopia is a \u201cmeditation on the impossible,\u201d others like Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz insist that \u201cwe must dream and enact new and better pleasures, other ways of being in the world, and ultimately new worlds.\u201d Utopian and dystopian fictions tend to lead us back to the present and force confrontations with the horrors of war, the ravages of capitalist exploitation, the violence of social hierarchies and the ruinous peril of environmental decline. In the films and novels and essays we engage here, we will not be looking for answers to questions about what to do and nor should we expect to find maps to better futures. We will no doubt be confronted with dead ends, blasted landscapes and empty gestures. But we will also find elegant aesthetic expressions of ruination, inspirational confrontations with obliteration, brilliant visions of endings, breaches, bureaucratic domination, human limitation and necro-political chaos. We will search in the narratives of uprisings, zombification, cloning, nuclear disaster, refusal, solidarity, for opportunities to reimagine world, ends, futures, time, place, person, possibility, art, desire, bodies, life and death",

Indeed, the course will range widely, beginning in the early 14th century, and ending in the second decade of the 21st. We will explore multiple different sub-genres of horror, ranging from lyric poetry to film, to explore how horror afforded authors with a highly flexible and experimental means of thinking through enduring questions about human life, linguistic meaning, social connectedness, connectedness with The Beyond, scientific inquiry, and violence. We will explore a series of through-lines: most notably that of cultural otherness, with Jewishness as a particularly archetypal other, thus the pronounced treatment of Jewish literature throughout the course. Other through-lines will include the ideas of placelessness, violence toward women, perverse Christian ritual, and the uncanny valley that separates humans from non-humans.

Drawing on case studies from media and film studies, students are invited to review and deconstruct video essays, podcasts, interactive essays, and digital storytelling. The course aims to encourage students to think beyond traditional written formats, explore new methods of critical analysis and argument, and to create publishable or presentable video essays. It supports the conception and production of new knowledge through media, constructing critical insights that utilize the expressiveness of our contemporary audiovisual networks",

Social networks, television, cinema: all shape our aesthetic sensibilities and our political visions. Yet we often lack a basic understanding of what could be called \u201cvisual literacy.\u201d This introductory course gives students the critical tools to analyze how film and other visual media really work \u2013 in order to appreciate their artistic and social achievements, as well as to guard against their insidious manipulative devices. In the first part of the semester, we focus on film analysis through a detailed study of the different production phases of filmmaking \u2013 from screenwriting and mise-en-sc\u00e8ne to editing and film scoring. We pay special attention to the way in which certain stylistic and narrative choices have particular ideological effects. The second part of the course looks at film history through a comprehensive, chronological overview of its main movements and periods, including the coming of sound in Hollywood cinema, post-war Italian Neorealism, the emergence of world auteurs, New Waves of the 1960s and 1970s, etc. Students will use the hermeneutical tools learnt in film analysis to intellectually engage with some masterworks of film history. In the third and final part of the semester, we study the major debates of film theory from perspectives such as auteurism, formalism, psychoanalysis, Marxism, feminism, postcolonial and queer studies, etc. Required screenings include Nanook of the North (Flaherty, 1922), Sunrise (Murnau, 1927), Man with a Movie Camera (Vertov, 1929), Casablanca (Curtiz, 1942), Bicycle Thieves (De Sica, 1948), Rashomon (Kurosawa, 1950), Breathless (Godard, 1960), Belle de Jour (Bu\u00f1uel, 1967), The Hour of the Furnaces (Solanas, 1968), Seven Beauties (Wertm\u00fcller, 1974), Blue Velvet (Lynch, 1986), Paris Is Burning (Livingstone, 1990), and Children of Men (Cuar\u00f3n, 2006)",

By accepting Hollywood\u2019s narrative model as central, film scholars have often relegated non-male, non-white, non-Western films to a secondary role. Often described as \u201cmarginal\u201d or \u201cperipheral\u201d cinemas, the outcomes of these film practices have been systematically excluded from the canon. Yet\u2026 are these motion pictures really \u201csecondary\u201d? In relation to what? And according to whom? This course looks at major films by women filmmakers of the 20th Century within a tradition of political cinema that 1) directly confronts the hegemonic masculinity of the Hollywood film industry, and 2) relocates the so-called \u201calternative women\u2019s cinema\u201d at the core of film history. Unlike conventional feminist film courses, which tend to be contemporary and anglocentric, this class adopts a historical and worldwide perspective; rather than focusing on female directors working in America today, we trace the origins of women\u2019s cinema in different cities of the world (Berlin, Paris, New York) during the silent period, and, from there, we move forward to study major works by international radical directors such as Lorenza Mazzetti, Agn\u00e8s Varda, Forough Farrokhzad, V\u011bra Chytilov\u00e1, Chantal Akerman, Liliana Cavani, Barbara Kopple, Larisa Shepitko, and Mira Nair. We analyse how these filmmakers have explored womanhood not only as a source of oppresion (critique of patriarchal phallocentrism, challenge to heteronormativity, etc) but, most importantly, as a source of empowerment (defense of matriarchy, equal rights, lesbian love, inter- and transexuality...). Required readings include seminal texts of feminist film theory by Claire Johnston, Laura Mulvey, Ann Kaplan, bell hooks, and Judith Butler. Among the films screened in the classroom are: silent movies \u2013\"Suspense\" (Lois Weber, 1913), \"The Smiling Madame Beudet\" (Germaine Dulac, 1922)\u2014, early independent and experimental cinema \u2013\"Girls in Uniform\" (Leontine Sagan, 1931), \"Ritual in Transfigured Time\" (Maya Deren, 1946)\u2014, \u201cnew wave\u201d films of the 1950s and 1960s \u2013\"Together\" (Mazzetti, 1956), \"Cl\u00e9o from 5 to 7\" (Varda, 1962), \"Daisies\" (Chytilov\u00e1, 1966)\u2013, auteur cinema of the 1970s \u2013 \"Jeanne Dielman\" (Akerman, 1975), \"The Ascent\" (Shepitko, 1977)\u2013, and documentary films \u2013\"Harlan County, USA\" (Kopple, 1976), \"Paris Is Burning\" (Jennie Livingston, 1990)",

This course will look at the evolution of her work and aesthetic with particular attention to the imaginative way she created hybrids from fiction, documentary, biography and autobiography. Her early masterpiece, Cl\u00e9o from 5 to 7, plays with near-real time and creates a profound depiction of a woman's inner life, a melding of form and content that would run through her career. In various films, notably Jane B. by Agn\u00e8s V. and Jacquot de Nantes, she artfully enhanced biography with fiction. In documentaries such as The Gleaners and I she created a performative first-person narrative and warm on-screen presence. And in the later stage of her career she created multi-media installations. We will examine her visual style, which often incorporates elements of photography and painting. We will look at the themes of time and memory that shape so many of her films. And we will see how she frequently addressed social issues including women's rights and homelessness, putting the films in the context of the times in which they were created, and considering their relevance now. We will also look at her changing critical reputation. Often called the mother of the New Wave, she was more accurately New Wave-adjacent, overshadowed early in her career by Truffaut and Godard. In the last years before her death, in 2019, she was lauded as a feminist pioneer. But that acclaim, including an honorary Oscar, rarely grappled with the true depth, originality and importance of her work, which this course aims to do.

In this course, we shall begin to approach some of the major topics of contemporary film theory -- narrativity, subject-construction, the relation of words to images -- through the lens of texts that have remained largely outside the network of citations and references we normally associate with the work of professional media theory. We might begin the groundwork for an \"opening up\" or critique of some of the blind spots of current theory; at the very least, we shall be reading works that challenge our usual ways of theorizing",

Along with considering the formal properties of film and the historical forces that shaped it, the course explores what cultural analysts can learn from film.

The fall of the communist state had an outsized effect on the Russian mediascape. The four pillars of mass media which had previously been nationalized \u2014 cinema, television, radio, and the paper press \u2014 now had to contend with the challenges of the free market. These new economic conditions, together with technological developments and the disappearance of tight ideological control imposed by the state, led to a radical redefinition of the media industry. The Internet, which officially came to Russia in 1994, complicated the picture further. The course primarily focuses on moving image media \u2014 cinema, television and the Internet, tracing the historical development of each, analyzing a range of key works produced during this period. Our focus will be on the relationship between media and politics. We deliberately avoid referring to the period in question as post-Soviet or Putin\u2019s Russia because both of these terms come with a set of assumptions and expectations which would limit the scope of our conversation. Instead, we emphasize the diversity of the contemporary Russian mediascape and how different productions negotiated questions of gender, national identity, and politics during the period in question. We conclude by examining the sudden recent conclusion of the relative ideological flexibility which was prompted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, as well as the way platforms such as YouTube and services such as VPN continue making an alternative media sphere possible for Russian speakers. There is no language requirement to take this seminar. All required readings and course materials will be available in English",

These works defy traditional constraints as they shift away from a one-to-many to a many-to-many paradigm, transforming those formerly known as the audience from passive viewers into storytellers in their own right. New opportunities and limitations offered by emergent technologies are augmenting the grammar of storytelling, as creators wrestle with an ever-shifting digital landscape. New Media Art pulls back the curtain on transmedial works of fiction, non-fiction, and emergent forms that defy definition. Throughout the semester well explore projects that utilize Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and the Internet of Things, alongside a heavy-hitting selection of new media thinkers, theorists, and critics. The course will be co-taught as a dialogue between artistic practice and new media theory. Lance Weiler, a new media artist and founder of Columbia\u2019s Digital Storytelling Lab, selected the media artworks; Rob King, a film and media historian, selected the scholarly readings. It is in the interaction between these two perspectives that the course will explore the parameters of emerging frontiers in media art and the challenges these pose for existing critical vocabularies",

The exchanges that occur between the content of American television and its ever-broadening audience really shaped perspective on the American character and American values across fifty years. Indeed, it\u2019s difficult to imagine that the cultures of consensus and conformity that shaped the 1950s were in fact attainable in the absence of television. But, and at the same time, we must admire the creativity of shows like Donna Reed or Wagon Train that made certain that subtilty insured the advocacy for a more democratic America. We begin with brief attention to the most immediate creative influences on early television: vaudeville, and radio. Across the semester we will then consider the evolution of the various technologies that shaped and reshaped the American experience of television. While our focus remains on creative content, we must also note the moments where television afforded new experiences of collective sympathy (JFK and MLK assassinations, the Vietnam War etc.) as well as collective failure (The Pentagon Papers, Iran Contra, Rodney King) and triumph (Civil Rights Movement across the American South, the moon landing etc.). We will also, of course, consider the full implications of television \u201cevents\u201d that afforded news kinds national debate concerning the very soul of America: Roots, the final episode of M*A*S*H*, and The Day After) Finally, we will conclude with discussion of HBO and the formative impress of unprecedented creative achievement: The Sopranos, The Wire, Deadwood, Mad Men; and, we must consider that during the early years of the 21st century these serial dramas represent a particular (and unprecedented) manifestation of American art and artistry",

Directors include Cl\u00e9ment, Franju, Oph\u00fcls, Renoir, Rivette, and Semb\u00e8ne.

        "course_description": "\nIn its widest sense, transgression is the violation of cultural, social, religious, and legal norms or laws. Traditionally, transgression is regarded as being unacceptable, objectionable, and even harmful. Certain behaviors, such as cannibalism or incest (Freud 1913; L\u00e9vi-Strauss 1949), are transculturally deemed as taboo. From another perspective, however, transgression holds the potential to rupture and radically reshape the status quo, a conviction perhaps most evident in the realm of art. Transgressive art shocks us, it elicits outrage, paralyzes us in horror, it makes our stomachs turn, our knees weak. It shakes the tenets of our morals, challenges our sensibilities, and interrogates our notions of what is offensive, appropriate, and societally acceptable. What is it about a work of art that makes it transgressive? Do we know it when we see it? Is it derived from a work\u2019s content or is it also a question of its form? How does it interface with questions of authorship, sociopolitical context, and reception? What limit must a work go beyond in order to be deemed transgressive? What is the relationship between subversion and transgression? Can we speak of an aesthetics of transgression? 2 These questions will drive our exploration and critical engagement with French and Francophone literature and film. In addition to offering a broad overview of 20th - and 21st -century French and Francophone literary and cinematic production, this course will focus on the shifting cultural, social, and political contexts of these works. We will consider how these contexts \u2013 in conjunction with a work\u2019s content and form \u2013 shape what constitutes transgression and how or why a work is shocking. To contemplate a more comprehensive understanding of transgression and its specificities and contingencies, we will cover an array of literary and cinematographic genres (prose narrative, autofiction, nouveau roman, noir thriller, new wave, experimental film, horror), and themes (romantic love, desire, sexuality, colonialism, familial relations, cultural norms, religion, censorship). Along with primary source texts and films, we will read selected secondary sources to gain knowledge of influential theories of transgression and raise additional questions related to race, gender, genre, sexuality, violence, and the construction of the self",

Alice Diop is a young Black woman of Muslim culture, born in the banlieues from an immigrant family of modest means. Each of these six identities alone make her an outsider in a traditionally Parisian, white, bourgeois and heavily male French cinema environment. Taken together, these characteristics form the main thread of this seminar: the aesthetics, intersectional identities and universalist aspirations in Alice Diop\u2019s that interrogate contemporary France. This class will present foundational themes of Diop's work, themes that are intimately weaved throughout the life of the filmmaker. Through these themes, we will analyze the theories of consciousness that are transforming French society at the beginning of the 21st century. Through Alice Diop's cinema and our guest speaker's works, this seminar will review the mutations of universalism \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise, from Ronsard and Montaigne's pre-Enlightenment notions of universalism as humanism to the current debates in the articulation of race, class, gender and citizenship",

Why do some bestiaries (catalogues of animals) include human animals but not others? How did medieval people understand Genesis and the notion of \u2018dominion\u2019 given to humans over the rest of creation? In the next unit, we will turn to talking animals, both in medieval philosophical texts and in literature. Do they speak differently from human animals? Do humans speak differently when speaking of them (for example, do texts about parrots or other bird mimics start to \u2018parrot\u2019 other texts?). We next turn to cases of metamorphosis (human to animal or vice versa) and hybridity (in which a single body is both human and animal). What do these texts reveal about what is proper to the human and how does the body play a role in shoring up species identity? In a final unit, we turn to assemblages\u2014conglomerations in which human and nonhuman animals act together. We will look both at chivalry (knight horse) and at medieval lovers, who are often surrounded by birds",

        "course_description": "\nThis course will be dedicated to the study of three authors whom Nietzsche called masters of Seelenpr\u00fcfung(examination of the soul) and whose heritage he explicitly embraced both stylistically and philosophically: Pascal, La Rochefoucauld and La Bruy\u00e8re. In French literary history these writers are traditionally known as \u201cmoralists of the seventeenth century\u201d or \u201cclassical French moralists.\u201d The term moralist was not used in the seventeenth century and did not appear until the nineteenth century, when these three writers were grouped in anthologies. Yet their affinities were clear even at the time of the production of these works: when La Bruy\u00e8re published his Caract\u00e8res (1696) he explicitly referenced La Rochefoucauld\u2019s Maximes (1678) and Pascal\u2019s Pens\u00e9es (1670) to outline the similarities and differences between his work and theirs. These three prose writers were called moralistes because of their focus on moeurs (human behavior). Their perspective is not at all moralizing in the trivial sense of the term (denouncing behavior that falls short of a stated norm). The moralistes are relentless analysts of the complexities and inconsistencies of human behavior and they present their observations in the form of pithy statements with varying degrees of generalization. In La Rochefoucauld, the embrace of the short form is explicit and systematic. In Pascal, it is due in part to the unfinished and fragmentary nature of the work. In La Bruy\u00e8re, the use of the short form coexists with its opposite. Part of the attraction of these writers for modern readers is their mistrust of appearances and their exacting search for hidden motives, making them forerunners of the \u201chermeneutics of suspicion\u201d",

How do we think historically about the relationships between nation, Republic and empire? How has the 'imperial turn' shaped the categories and writing practices of historians?

If Wittgenstein is right and every world ends at the limits of its language, then what lies beyond? What happens after the end? This course will consider these questions by investigating the end of the world in a variety of texts and contexts from the fourteenth century to the present: as a recurrent literary theme, religious fixation, philosophical conundrum, source of endless entertainment, and spring of existential anxiety. Contrary to what the phrase portends, we will find that there is no singular \u201cend\u201d of the world. Worlds end all the time. We therefore will approach the idea of the end as a question of ruins and remnants, an encounter with the void at the end of history, but also as a site of new beginnings, of futures we have yet to imagine\u2014or can only imagine, if this means to glimpse what might be beyond the patterns of thought, belief, and action, the terms and conditions, the very language of the decaying world we inhabit.

This course reads a set of writers who both respond to and participate in that process of constant transformation \u2013 in what we have learned to call modernity. Should culture try to protect timeless values from the shock effects of modernization? Or should it find, in change, an opportunity for new forms of life and new styles of expression?

So is endlessly scrolling through social media, binge-watching a television series, or strolling aimlessly through the city. Where and how we use our attention is the foundation, the bedrock, of nearly everything we think and do. It is therefore unsurprising that gathering and directing our attention is also an enormous, lucrative industry. In this course we will study the science and philosophy of attention alongside the history of the \"attention economy\" and evolving techniques and technologies of attention harvesting. We will explore these subjects while reflecting upon and writing about our own habits of paying attention. By paying attention to attention, we will nurture a brighter awareness of the many interests vying for our time, mental engagement, money, our very lives, and of our abilities to scrutinize, critically examine, or resist our entrapment within the modern attention industry",

These narratives deploy stereotypes to characterize non-European geographies and people as excessively sensual and cast outside the progressive flow of time, waiting to be discovered by the white traveler. Edward Said termed this projected fantasy of sexual decadence \u201cOrientalism,\u201d or the cultural/historical reduction of \u201cthe East\u201d into a stockpile of recognizable tropes. This reduction serves an ideological goal: to portray the North/West as the intellectual/cultural elite, and the South/East as the mere object of the former\u2019s cataloguing fetish. This First-Year Writing course interrogates canonical texts of nineteenth- and twentieth-century European literature and travel writing by formulating questions about the erotic dimension of empires, with Said\u2019s critical intervention as our guide. How is sexuality configured in colonial writing? What do these configurations tell us about the ideological map superimposed over the colony and the metropole? How do these constructions of sexuality continue to proliferate in our contemporary moment, and for what political ends?",

We will consider how sexuality delineates the field of the normal from the pathological (Ellis, Freud); how it functions as a \"dense transfer point for relations of power\" (Foucault, Mbembe); how it undergirds racism and colonial ideologies (Fanon, Puar); how it encrypts the inexpressible in important works of literature and film.

We will situate major literary innovations of the 18th century in the context of changing reading and theater cultures and focus primarily on Lessing\u2019s innovative domestic tragedy, and on poems and an epistolary novel by Goethe. Then we will discuss the literary production of the 19th century by analyzing changing concepts of art, music and literature during those times of great social and political change. We will study (and translate) poems, and read pamphlets and novellas by Tieck, Kleist, H\u00f6lderlin, Novalis, Brentano, Eichendorff, G\u00fcnderrode, Droste-H\u00fclshoff, Heine, B\u00fcchner, M\u00f6rike, Keller and Fontane. **This course is taught entirely in German",

We will trace two forces closely associated with \u201cmodernity\u201d: the art and technology of cinema as an international medium and sexuality as a socially significant aspect of individual personhood, collective politics and public concern. We will consider both film and sexuality as intertwined vectors of social and cultural change, as well as aesthetic and artistic practice, and we will apply our film-analytical framework to develop a better understanding of German culture over the last century. Our course will draw from feminist and queer film studies, cultural studies, critical theory, and histories of gender and sexuality to build our methodology. Through our shared film viewings and class discussions, we will exercise practical forms of critical understanding and communication about modern German cinema and culture",

We will explore how feelings have been gendered and racialized; how they overlap with matters of sex (as closely associated with political revolt in Western Europe, while considered too private for public articulation in the socialist East, especially when queer); and how they foreground matters of nation and trauma (for example via the notions of German \u2018coldness\u2019 and inability to mourn the Holocaust). Simultaneously, the focus on feelings highlights questions of mediality (cinema as a prototypically affective medium?), genre and avant-garde aesthetics: in many films, \u2018high-affect\u2019 Hollywood cinema intriguingly meets \u2018cold\u2019 cinematic modernism. In pursuing these investigative vectors through theoretical readings and close film analysis, the course connects affect, gender, queer, and cultural studies approaches with cinema studies methodologies. The films to be discussed span postwar and New German Cinema, East German DEFA productions, the \u2018Berlin School\u2019 of the 2000s, and contemporary transnational cinema",

This course is designed to engage literature and epistemology surrounding these New World conflicts as a means of the colonial and post-colonial past in North America. We will explore the emergence of intersecting indigenous and European national identities tied to the social construction of space and race. In this course I will ask you to re-think American history by situating North America as a Native space, a place that was occupied and controlled by indigenous peoples. You will be asked to imagine a North America that was indigenous and adaptive, and not necessarily destined to be absorbed by European settler colonies. Accordingly, this course we will explore the intersections of European colonial settlement and Euro-American national expansion, alongside of the emergence of indigenous social formations that dominated the western interior until the middle of the 19th century. This course is intended to be a broad history of Indigenous North America during a tumultuous period, but close attention will be given to use and analysis of primary source evidence. Similarly, we will explore the necessity of using multiple genres of textual evidence \u2013 archival documents, oral history, material artifacts, etc., -- when studying indigenous history",

Moreover, by locating nature within human history, environmental history encourages its practitioners to rethink some of the fundamental categories through which our understanding of the natural world is expressed: wilderness and civilization, wild and tame, natural and artificial. For those interested in the study of ethnicity, environmental history casts into particularly sharp relief the ways in which the natural world can serve both to undermine and to reinforce the divisions within human societies.

In this course, we will take a sceptical look at these claims. How coherent a political entity was \u2018Britain\u2019\u2014a monarchy composed of at least four distinct and fractious nations, presiding over a scattered empire of trade, conquest and settlement? Who in Britain really benefited from the prosperity made possible by the dramatic industrial and imperial expansion that characterised the period? What forms of freedom, and what kinds of social control, were made possible by Victorian ideologies of \u2018liberal\u2019 government and laissez-faire economics? Why were British elites so often uncertain and divided when it came to questions of imperial rule\u2014especially in Ireland, the oldest and nearest dependency of the empire? In the course of asking these questions, we will of course be learning about the history of Britain itself, alongside the parts of the world it interacted with during the nineteenth century: something that, thanks to a wealth of primary sources (many of them now online) and a strong tradition of sophisticated historiography, will be a highly rewarding intellectual experience. We will also, however, be learning and thinking about other things\u2014the histories of capitalism, religion, gender, empire, fossil fuels, migration, agriculture, slavery and political ideology, among others\u2014that are of a much more general, and contemporary relevance.

While our primary geographic focus will be the United States, Brazil, and the Caribbean, the thrust of the course encourages students to consider sports in local, national, and transnational contexts. The guiding questions of the course are: What is the relationship between sport and society? How does sport inform political transformations within and across national borders? How does sport reinforce and/or challenge social hierarchies? Can sport provide alternative visions of the self and community? Throughout the semester we will examine such topics as: the continuing political struggles surrounding the staging of mega-events such as the Olympics and World Cup, the role of professional baseball in the rise and fall of Jim Crow segregation, the impact of football on the evolution of masculine identities in the U.S., the impact of tennis on the Second-Wave feminist movement, and the role of sports in the growth of modern American cities. Course materials include works by historians, sociologists, social theorists, and journalists who have also been key contributors to the burgeoning field of sports studies.

Working from the notion that sport is \u201cmore than a game,\u201d the class will examine the social, economic, cultural, and political impact of sports in distinct hemispheric American contexts from the late 19th century until the present. While our primary geographic focus will be the United States, Brazil, and the Caribbean, the course encourages students to examine sports in other local, national, and transnational settings. During the summer session we will focus on three themes that exemplify the ways the sporting realm illuminates some of the pressing problems of our time: the conflicts engendered by the staging of mega-events such as the Olympics and World Cup; the impact of sports on the implementation of Title IX, and understandings of gender and sexuality; and football\u2019s impact on the evolution of masculine identities in the U.S.. Course materials include works by historians, sociologists, social theorists, and journalists who have also been key contributors to the burgeoning field of sports studies",

        "course_description": "\nOn Christmas Day 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev ended two things: his tenure as President of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union itself. The following day, Boris Yeltsin entered office as the first president of the Russian Federation, and without delay, began to institute radical economic and social reforms. Under his watch, the country privatized national industry, cut the state budget, and courted foreign multinational businesses. The world most commonly used to describe Russia in the early 1990s is \u201cdisappear\u201d: money, jobs, food, and people. The very things that Soviet-style socialism had committed itself to providing for started to vanish as a result of invisible and market forces. At the same time as they were being told to welcome the approaching era of capitalist abundance, ordinary Russians were scrambling to cope with and recover from all that appeared to be suddenly and permanently missing from their pay stubs, kitchen tables, and family photographs. This course will explore what emerged in the spaces left empty after Soviet-style socialism\u2019s demise. The course will be divided into three parts. The first part of the semester will examine the origins of the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse and its breakup into fifteen successor states. Who was Mikhail Gorbachev, and why did the reforms instituted as part of glasnost and perestroika fail to revitalize the Soviet system? How did citizens - elites and average people alike - from Russia, the Soviet republics, and satellite states witness the collapse, and how did they manage the immediate transition to capitalism? The second part of the semester will survey the political, economic, and social processes that followed the collapse. How did former Soviet citizens reintegrate themselves in the new economies, political movements, and social structures that emerged in the Russian Federation under Yeltsin? In what ways did privatization and the arrival of foreign capital shape labor practices, consumer habits, the natural and built environment, and forms of cultural expression? What forms did nationalist movements in the former republics and and Warsaw Pact countries take? Finally, the third part of the course will focus on Putin\u2019s ascendancy to the presidency and its consequences for Russian citizens at home and Russia\u2019s image abroad. We will consider the role that memory and myth play in the formation of a \u201cUnited Russian\u201d consciousness, the costs and benefits of life in Putin\u2019s Russia, and the transformation of the international system under Vladimir Vladimirovich. By semester\u2019s end, students will have acquired the content and analytical literacy to place present-day Russia in its specific historical context and identify multiple sources of causation that may help explain Russia\u2019s transition from socialism to capitalism to Putinism during the past quarter century",

On one hand, oceans and rivers affected the characteristics and resources of different civilizations. Throughout history, every community depended on access to water resources, developed local practices of water management, and produced cultural and scientific understandings of \u201cwater.\u201d On the other hand, human attempts at regulating water flows aimed at controlling life itself, as water is essential for life. Hydro-power, before being a renewable source energy, required exerting political power over humans and nature alike. Grounded in the interdisciplinary approach of the environmental humanities, this class will explore the politics of water management thanks to a wide range of case studies. Starting with the first environmental history of the Mediterranean in the early modern period, we will focus on the last two centuries to examine the roots of the current environmental crisis.

There is growing concern over BPA, lead, PCBs, asbestos, and synthetic materials that make up the world around us. This course will focus on environmental history, industrial and labor history as well as on how twentieth century consumer culture shapes popular and professional understanding of disease. Throughout the term the class will trace the historical transformation of the origins of disease through primary sources such as documents gathered in lawsuits, and medical and public health literature. Students will be asked to evaluate historical debates about the causes of modern epidemics of cancer, heart disease, lead poisoning, asbestos-related illnesses and other chronic conditions. They will also consider where responsibility for these new concerns lies, particularly as they have emerged in law suits. Together, we will explore the rise of modern environmental movement in the last 75 years",

You will be asked to imagine a North America that was indigenous and adaptive, as well as colonial and Euro-American. This approach to the study of North American history is designed to challenge the epistemology and literature of the history of colonization and American expansion, which displaces Native peoples from the central narrative of American history by placing them at the physical margins of colonial and national development. Instead we will explore the intersection and integration of indigenous and Euro-American national identity and national space in North America and trace their co-evolution from first contact through the early nineteenth century",

Literary works far exceed the limited narratives of Caribbean history by imagining entire worlds that official documents could never contain, rich selves, cultures and communities built by many generations of Caribbean people. This course is aimed at bringing forth a broader understanding of Caribbean history by examining a body of creative works by feminist and womanist writers that continuously remain attuned to the complexities of the past, which are either underrepresented or absent in the record. Chosen literary texts will also be paired with historical works that will illuminate and contextualize the multiple themes with which these Caribbean authors frequently engage, including slavery, and colonialism, racism and colorism, migration and immigration, gender and sexuality, poverty and globalization. From these pairings, students will explore both the divergences and alignments in how writers and historians approach the work of retelling the past, and will acquire reading and writing skills that will foster thoughtful critical analysis of the ever-changing contours of the Caribbean\u2019s history",

The major question underpinning this course is, therefore, how have people responded to past climate events, whether short-term, decadal or longer in scope? This question is predicated on the complexity of human society and moves away from the binary of collapse vs. resilience that dominates much thinking about the impact of climate changes on past societies. This framing recognizes the significance of climate for food production and collection, as well as trade and cosmologies. It does not take climate to be the determining factor in history.

What laws, ideas, and affects construct political borders? What happens to those who breach them? How do the legacies of racial slavery, settler colonialism, and ethno-nationalism unsettle the borders of contemporary Mediterranean?",

To advance this mission, ACT must confront the reality that in the current political moment new legal, political, and social barriers are being erected to the integration, advancement, and engagement of African immigrants on a daily basis. As immigrants, as Black people, as Africans, and often as women, low-income people, LGBT people, and Muslims, African immigrants experience multiple intersecting forms of marginalization.

We will follow the course of the development of Mughal political thought, economic and environmental impact and courtly culture through to their official demise in 1857. The first four emperors of Mughal India left various accounts for us. Babur (r. 1525\u20131530), the founder of the dynasty, wrote an autobiography. Memoirs of the second, Humayun (r. 1530\u20131556), were written by his sister, and others in his army. The third, Akbar (r. 1556\u20131605) was the subject of the most amazing regnal history-- written by his minister and aide Abu'l Fazl. His son Jahangir (r. 1605\u20131627), recorded his daily activities and thoughts in his own journal that was published by him. To best engage with this complex universe, we will use the semantic vocabulary of \u2018seeing\u2019. This course will delve into how Mughal emperors saw their world and how they narrated it.

The Black Lives Matter movement has extended still further, inciting communities across the globe to raise their voices against discrimination and inequality. Rather than viewing the United States\u2014 and the north Atlantic, more generally\u2014 through an exceptionalist lens, this seminar draws on the strong transnational resonance of the Black Lives Matter movement and the compelling responses of global communities across distinct demographics and colonial histories to decenter the historical origins of race thinking and provincialize its conceptual centrality as a first step in understanding its reach and relevance as a global signifier of \u201cdifference\u201d today. How might we develop critical studies of race and racism that are truly global and extend beyond the historical experience of the North Atlantic, and North America in particular? Might we consider the concept history of race, commonly associated with the Atlantic World and plantation slavery as a form of historical difference proximate to other practices of social hierarchy and distinction across the modern world? How can scholarship that addresses questions of black vitality, fugitivity and Afropessimism engage productively and rigorously with questions of colonial servitude and postcolonial sovereignty that emanates from anticaste thought, ideas of Islamic universality, Pan-Africanism, or heterodox Marxisms? An exercise in comparative thinking, this seminar will function as an interstitial home for intellectual engagements in both the Global South and North, excavating linkages between injustices perpetrated through divisions of race, caste, and minority status, as well as the conceptual innovations born from struggles against them. We are explicitly focused on the relationship between worldmaking and concept formation. Questions of historical comparison and conceptual convergence are important. So, too the forms of sociopolitical solidarity and political utopias that have arisen as a consequence of struggles against enslavement and imperialism. Every seminar session will open with a twenty-minute discussion about political and social historical contexts.

The site will serve as a textbook for future iterations of The Black Sea in History, and, while we will have a complete version by the end of the semester, future students will also be able to contribute. BSVT will be publicly accessible, so not limited to classroom use",

Both powers drew on this territory\u2019s vast resources\u2014organic, mineral, animal, and human\u2014to dominate their neighbors and exert power on the world stage. In the process, they dramatically reconfigured local ecosystems, from Central Asian deserts to Pacific islands. This seminar traces the interaction between empire and environment across three eras: Tsarist, Soviet, and post-Soviet. Its approach is comparative, framing developments in Russia alongside those elsewhere\u2014in China, Europe, and the US. The course asks: How have modern polities transformed Eurasia\u2019s land, water, and air? In turn, how has the natural world shaped the trajectories of diverse imperial projects? And what legacies have these encounters left for today? Topics include settler colonialism, energy transitions, \u201cnatural\u201d disasters, warfare, environmentalism, scientific diplomacy, ecocide, climate change, and the comparative footprints of capitalism and communism. While the approach is historical, students will engage materials from across disciplines (alongside films, novellas, and other primary sources) with an eye towards today\u2019s political and ecological dilemmas. The seminar is designed for upper-division and graduate students with an interest in environmental history methods. Previous exposure to Russian and Eurasian Studies is helpful, but not required",

This tutorial will offer students a deep dive not only into the historical depths of the Stalin era but into the gloriously complex historiographical debates that surround it. Some of the questions that will animate the readings, writings, and discussions that students will engage in are as follows: Did Stalin depart from or represent a continuation of the policies introduced by his predecessor Vladimir Lenin? Did he rule in a totalitarian fashion or in ways comparable to other twentieth century regimes? Were his policies destructive or possibly productive? And perhaps most boggling of all: why did no one resist Stalinist rule?",

        "course_description": "\nNearly 80 years have passed since the Second World War: a majority of Europeans no longer have an autobiographical memory of the war. Yet the legacy of the Second World War is all the more present because the \u201cheroic\u201d myths that many European nations adopted after 1945 have now been replaced by negative memories. Europe no longer celebrates the Resistance fighter who died for a cause, but now recognizes European Jews as victims. To explore the way in which the Second World War remains present in post-war European societies that it helped to shape, the seminar will take as its starting point the Nuremberg trials of 1945-1948 and continue throughout the last trials of Nazi criminals in Germany. It will also look at the responses of the judicial, political and social actors. The seminar highlights the extent to which the complex relationship between justice, history and memory surrounding the Second World War is still relevant today. Through various case studies, we will examine the political, memorial and legal issues and debates raised by this difficult history through a comparative analysis of trials in France and Germany, thereby situating these processes in a European context. The seminar questions the place of witnesses and the administration of evidence in these collective crimes and invites reflection on the types of sources that public policies of the past can mobilize to mediate these trials for the \"devoir de m\u00e9moire\u201d (obligation of remembrance). A variety of sources will be used including, news clips, photographs and legal documents, in addition to the preparatory readings for each session",

The key aim of the course will be to introduce students to reading and analyzing a range of historical scholarship, and interdisciplinary research on environment, health, medicine and populations in South Asia and to introduce them to an exploration of primary sources for research; and also to probe the challenges posed by archives and sources in these fields. Some of the overarching questions that shape this course are as follows: How have environmental pasts and medical histories been interpreted, debated and what is their contemporary resonance? What have been the encounters (political, intellectual, legal, social and cultural) between the environment, its changing landscapes and state? How have citizens, indigenous communities, and vernacular healers mediated and shaped these encounters and inserted their claims for sustainability, subsistence or survival? How have these changing landscapes shaped norms about bodies, care and beliefs?

        "course_description": "\nThis seminar offers a critical overview of recent literature on the historical emergence of national identities and the creation of national states. We will examine a series of books that present new ways of problematizing the nation and its construction and consolidation. These works take novel approaches foregrounding gender, temporality, memory, religion, economic development, local affinities, networks, and empire, among other frameworks. Building on classic literature on the nation and its origins from history, anthropology, political science, and political economy, the texts covered in this course nevertheless suggest new conclusions about the foundations, conditions of emergence, and persistence of national states and national identities. What is a nation? How are nations formed? What could the nation have been, what other forms could it have taken, and what other types of political organization could have provided the basis for group identification or the structure of global order? To what extent did regional identities, on one hand, and imperial or supranational identities, on the other hand, affect the development of specific nations and of the nation-state in general? Why does every national group implicitly deserve or possess a state? Why are those nation-states territorial? How do nation-states generate and maintain the allegiance of their citizens and instill or ascribe membership in a national group? How do nations police or depend upon the gender, racial, and class identities of their subjects? This seminar also seeks to raise a set of other questions about historical method and craft. How do we write and think about nationalism today? With histories of the nation rightly challenged by transnational approaches, does the nation still constitute a meaningful unit of historical analysis, and if so, in what ways? How do we take account of the nation as a historical fact while acknowledging the nation as a construction? With more virulent forms of right-wing nationalism and nationalist populism on the rise around the world, on the other hand, how should national histories and mythologies be questioned, reframed, and undermined? Drawing on this recent literature, this seminar will seek to propose provisional answers to these questions and others about the nation and nationalism. Texts examined will cover both classic works on the nation and new works that revise or supplement them, as well as works that take novel approaches. Part of the course will historicize earlier theories of nationalism. New approaches will be situated within these traditions and in terms of how they depart from them and offer new avenues for research or theorization. Geographical areas covered will include Eastern Europe, Western Europe, North America, the Caribbean, Central Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Upper-level undergraduate students will learn not only about the nation, nationalism, and foundational historical interpretations of their development, but also about new trends in historical scholarship and new ways of writing national histories. The seminar will emphasize how national identity intersects with other forms of identity and other interests. Students will engage with related literature on Marxism, modernity, anti-colonialism, and the history of social thought",

        "course_description": "\nThis is a hands-on, project-driven, Laboratory Seminar that explores the frontiers of historical analysis in the information age. It harnesses the exponential growth in information resulting from the digitization of older materials and the explosion of \u201cborn digital\u201d electronic records. Machine learning and natural language processing make it possible to answer traditional research questions with greater rigor, and tackle new kinds of projects that would once have been deemed impracticable. At the same time, scholars now have many more ways to communicate with one another and the broader public, and it is becoming both easier \u2013 and more necessary \u2013 to collaborate across disciplines. This course will create a laboratory organized around a common group of databases in 20th century international history. Students will begin by learning about earlier methodological transformations in literary, cultural, and historical analysis, and consider whether and how the \u201cdigital turn\u201d might turn out differently. They will then explore new tools and techniques, including named-entity recognition, text classification, topic modeling, geographic information systems, social and citation network analysis, and data visualization. As we turn to specific projects, you will be able to either write a traditional history paper or try an alternative project, either working alone or as part of a team. Papers will entail applying one or more of the digital tools to a specific historical literature/debate or a novel historical topic. Projects might include assembling and \u201ccleaning\u201d a large dataset of documents, prototyping a new tool, launching a web-based exhibit, or drafting a grant application. You will be encouraged to seek out additional training as necessary, conduct experiments, and design ambitious projects that might extend beyond the life of the course. The seminar will meet every week, and start with a discussion of the readings. The second hour will be devoted to training in new tools for historical research, as well as individual and small group work. Students will also be encouraged to attend weekly lab meetings, and that will be a requirement of those undertaking alternative projects. The course is open to students with no training in statistics or computer programming, and no knowledge of international history. But all participants should be open to learning both historical and computational research skills, such as the critical reading of primary source documents and oral history interviewing on the one hand, and scraping websites, querying databases, and using data visualization tools on the other",

New York has become a particular flashpoint with a large influx of asylum seekers, most of them from Latin America.

We will look specifically at how Latin American citizens have engaged with the US asylum system over time and how this engagement has changed the shape of US immigration laws. We will study the origins of the ideas of international protection, who is understood to qualify and why, how the system has changed over time, and what these developments mean for a broader understanding of human rights across borders. We will also take a critical look at asylum, examine ideas of deservingness and innocence and their intersection with categories of race, class and gender, and question what it means for certain people to be constructed as victims and others to be seen as not eligible \u2013 or worthy \u2013 of protection.

        "course_description": "\nImmigration court has been described as akin to trying death penalty cases in traffic court. With a backlog of over two million cases and counting, judges have impossibly full dockets, cases get continued at the last minute, and many people are left to their own devices to try to make sense of what their options might be to stay in the United States. A key part of this confusion is because immigration court \u2013 though the stakes of decisions are as high as can be \u2013 is civil, not criminal. Given this, individuals are not guaranteed the right to a court appointed attorney. New York City, however, has been on the forefront of trying to remedy at least this part of the equation, piloting a unique program to guarantee representation to New Yorkers facing removal proceedings. While having access to an attorney can make a meaningful difference, immigration judges still enjoy wide discretion in how they decide a given case. The core idea of this course is that there is a real utility to observing immigration court, both for research and for contributing to social change. This course will center around a practice of court watching in immigration court in order to develop a scholarly analysis of systems, institutions, and the functioning (or not) of the law. At the same time, this court watching practice will also involve the systematic collection of qualitative data that may be directly useful to immigration attorneys and their clients in their perpetual effort to hold immigration courts accountable and create as fair as possible of a playing field that upholds the basic principles of human rights. To that end, in this class we will study how to conduct courtroom observations, drawing from different methodological approaches and findings, study the idea, history, and critiques of immigration law from across disciplines, and conduct extensive, in depth, immigration court watching. We will partner with local legal services organizations in order to sharpen our sense of what kinds of data is useful for their specific legal interventions and to ensure that the data that we do collect and interpret can become part of a larger project to hold courts accountable. This course will offer students a unique opportunity to see how rigorous social science research and analysis can have real impacts in the world beyond the classroom, and how those two realms, through collaboration, can mutually contribute to advancing social change. They will learn first-hand how the careful application of qualitative research can reveal and sometimes remedy real world situations of structural injustice. This is an engaged pedagogy course. The class will be organized around a close collaboration with a local legal services provider that represents immigrants in court in New York City. Students will learn the complexities of US immigration law and will work collectively, with the local organization, to develop data that could be useful in broader efforts to reform the process by which immigration claims are adjudicated",

As a framework for articulating and pursuing justice at local, national, and global levels, human rights in the 21st century draw on the diverse histories of social movements, moral philosophy, legal institutions, and political maneuvers across the modern period. Claimed most frequently when their violation is most egregious, the history of human rights is also a history of wrongs, with the changing nature and scope of oppression serving to provoke different kinds of human rights struggles. Often invoked as timeless and universal standards, the history of human rights demonstrates their basic malleability, both in terms of which rights are recognized and who qualifies as human, and their fundamental contingency, both in terms of the precariousness of any human rights \u2018victory\u2019 and their potential for co-optation in the interests of power. Finally, while this course is primarily concerned with the history of human rights, we will also consider the human rights of history, reflecting on the role of history and historical consciousness in the pursuit for justice. Learning Outcomes Aligned with the critical, historical, and integrative grounding of the course, the objectives for student learning encompass areas of knowledge, skills, and values.

While answering these questions, you will become familiar with the literature on human rights methodologies, and you will engage in analysis and critical assessment of important human rights research literature. In addition, the course gives a practical approach to research methodology. You will learn about a diverse set of methodologies, such as interviewing and focus groups, archival research, ethnographic and participant observation, interviewing focus groups, conducting online research; interpretive and non-empirical methods and basic quantitative methodologies to be employed in the study of human rights.

        "course_description": "\nCourse Description This interdisciplinary course explores both the rights of Indigenous people in settler colonies as well as the complex historical and theoretical relationship between human rights and settler colonialism. We will pursue three lines of inquiry. The first critically explores how central political concepts of the international state system\u2014sovereignty, property, territory, self-determination\u2014entwine the histories of settler colonialism and human rights. The second charts the rise and mechanisms of the international Indigenous rights movement, in particular its activity at the United Nations leading to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007, and its contributions to ongoing debates on environmental and climate justice, group rights, natural resources and territorial autonomy, and cultural rights. The third unit interrogates settler state responses to the movement for Indigenous human rights, such as cooptation, recognition, and apology. Through readings drawn from history, ethnography, political and critical theory, international relations, Native studies, law, and documents produced by intergovernmental organizations and NGOs, we will explore and deepen the tensions between human rights as a theory and practice and the political lives and aspirations of Indigenous peoples and activists. What technologies of rule\u2014such as residential school systems and property law\u2014do settler colonial states deploy to dispossess Indigenous peoples? How have Indigenous peoples used the international human rights regime to mobilize against such dispossession? How have these states resisted the global Indigenous rights movement? And can the human rights regime, rooted in the international state system, meaningfully contribute to anticolonial movements in liberal settler colonies? While we will touch on settler colonialism as it manifests around the globe, the course\u2019s geographical focus will be on North America. Course objectives Throughout this course, you will: Develop a historically-informed understanding of both international indigenous rights and settler colonialism as idea, practice, institution, and discourse; Place the literature on human rights and settler colonialism into critical conversation in order to deepen existing conceptual problems and generate new ones; Identify the main arguments in theoretical texts, legal and policy documents, and public debates; Read and think across disciplines to develop arguments that speak to multiple scholarly communities; Produce an original argument in relation to other authors\u2019 arguments, and construct and organize an analytical, argumentative paper; Communicate ideas effectively in class discussions and presentations; Bring case studies and questions encountered outside the course into the classroom to challenge or nuance the assigned material",

Should we prioritize redistribution or recognition? What can we learn from cases developed in the UN System, in regional systems of human rights, and in specific countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, North America, and Europe?

Premised as they are on exploitation, competition, and inequality rather than consideration, cooperation and balance, these systems of domination not only have caused the crisis but are seemingly unable to resolve it. Among the injustices of the contemporary impasse is the likelihood the people who have least benefited from the global (dis)order, and especially minorities in the global south, will be the worst affected casualties of climate change. Encompassing a focus on equity and frameworks for accountability and redress, the human rights paradigm is a useful lens through which to analyze the emergency, exert accountability, and imagine better futures. It is against this backdrop that this interdisciplinary (climate science, law, politics, social science, development studies and anthropology) course on Climate Justice has been introduced to the Human Rights Studies MA program. This 3-credit course addresses contemporary issues in the evolving discourse and epistemology of climate justice. How should we understand the climate emergency from a social justice perspective? What terminologies, discourses and paradigms are useful? How have individuals, non-government organizations and social movements sought to overcome climate change vulnerabilities and advance climate justice? What litigation, law and policy initiatives have been brought, and with what level of success? And what alternative models of living, working and being are conceivable for a more socially, ecologically, and existentially sustainable world?",

The announcement indicated a new era in the earth\u2019s chronology marked by the consequences of human activity on the planet\u2019s ecosystems. Closely related to discussions of sustainability, investigations into the Anthropocene tend to focus on environmental and ecological issues while ignoring its social justice dimensions. This course will investigate how Human Rights has and will be impacted by the Anthropocene, with special attention paid to the human dimensions and consequences of anthropogenic change. Do new and troubling revelations about anthropogenic mistreatment of the earth and its resources modify or amplify the kinds of responsibilities that govern activity between individuals and communities? How do we scale the human response from the urban, to the periurban, to the rural? How must the study of Human Rights evolve to address violence and mistreatment associated not just among humans but also amid human habitats? What sorts of juridical changes must occur to recognize and respond to new manifestations of social injustice that relate directly to consequences of anthropogenic changes to the Earth system? Topics will include discussions of the Environmental Justice movement, agribusiness, access to (and allocation of) natural resources, population growth; its global impact, advocacy for stronger and more accountability through environmental legal change, biodiversity in urban environments, and the growing category of environmental refugees",

Although its founding was grounded in fundamental norms of inalienable rights, equality and freedom, U.S. history is characterized by divisive and sometimes violent disagreements about who counts as human, what is fundamental to the human condition, and which/how rights should be protected. How has this history contributed to our contemporary struggles? Through engaging with issues related to racial justice, criminal justice, reproductive justice, disability justice, gender justice, and indigenous people\u2019s rights, students are asked to consider how certain rights are sites of contestation within the U.S. political system and within U.S. society. This course offers a multidisciplinary survey of urgent contemporary human rights issues in the United States and seeks to advance students\u2019 skills to examine human rights research and analysis through intersectional approaches. Part of the inquiry of this course is ensuring that students understand existing tensions among several key concepts (1) human rights as a body of international human rights law and institutions; (2) human rights movements using human rights discourse to further their aspirations; (3) constitutional rights in the U.S. as interpreted by U.S. courts that may or may not allude to/be contained in international law; and (4) political rhetoric that use the language of \u201crights\u201d for political ends. Coursework will ground current human rights debates in their social, legal, and political contexts. It will outline the different actors in the human rights landscape, focusing on mobilization strategies of human rights movements and the policy reforms that they seek to advance human rights agendas. Students will engage with legal cases and legislation in the United States. By the end of this course, you should expect to be able to: Understand critical human rights issues in the United States, and apply international and domestic human rights principles and practice to these contemporary human rights debates; Understand the role of social movements in shaping narratives around human rights; Analyze (through case studies) the real-life application and effects of human rights policies, as well as how they contribute to the promotion, progressive enforcement, and internalization of international human rights",

On the one hand, we have emerged from a century that has seen some of the most brutal practices ever perpetrated by states against their populations in the form of genocide, systematic torture, mass murder and ethnic cleansing. Many of these abuses occurred after the Holocaust, even though the mantra never again was viewed by many as a pledge never to allow a repeat of these practices. Events in the new century suggest that these trends will not end anytime soon. At the same time, since the middle of the twentieth century, for the first time in human history there has been a growing global consensus that all individuals are entitled to at least some level of protection from abuse by their governments. This concept of human rights has been institutionalized through international law, diplomacy, international discourse, transnational activism, and the foreign policies of many states.

Each week, we will dig into a particular theme or problem, such as embodied knowledge or social marginalization, and think through the ways in which these themes materialized in the specific historical contexts we covered in the first half of the semester",

Students occupied university campuses across the country - in the most dramatic cases storming lecture-halls, building barricades and wielding bamboo spears in clashes with the police, counter?protestors and each other. These protests coincided with a wave of other campus occupations around the world, including in the US, France, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and China. In Japan they marked the culmination of a decade of protest against a range of issues including (but not limited to) the Vietnam War, colonialism, nuclear weapons, pollution, inflation, consumerism, capitalism, corruption, labour abuses, police brutality, authoritarianism, censorship, patriarchy, conformity and boredom. This course explores why students protested and what methods they used. It asks what effect the protests had in terms of goals achieved, unintended consequences, and longer-lasting social and cultural legacies. How did protestors\u2019 motivations change over time, and how did Japanese state and society accommodate, repress or subvert the movements? How did the protests and subsequent crackdown transform universities as spaces for learning, research and socialization? What alliances did students seek to forge with peers, activists, guerillas and governments overseas? Was there such a thing as a global 1968, and if so was Japan a part of it? And in what ways did their protests resemble or differ from other student protests around the world, then and now?",

Students will be asked to revisit a foundational text they have encountered in their major, and use it as a mode of exploration and reflection on an internship. They will consider how the text\u2019s themes and ideas can be reinterpreted and recontextualized in the working world, and think about what practical, moral, political, aesthetic and personal insights it affords. More broadly, students will be prompted to consider the relationship of the liberal arts degree (which purports to prepare students for no particular career) to their chosen career path. This course will further hone the critical thinking and writing skills that are translatable to any profession, and enables a Barnard student to put into practice the complexities they have learned in the classroom, by encouraging them to analyze the professional world from different perspectives, and in the context of other ideas and traditions. The text will be selected from a list provided by the student\u2019s major department, and will be subject to approval from the course instructor. On a weekly basis, in this discussion-based class, the student shares their ideas about their text and how it relates to their internship. They respond to and engage with their classmates. They are required to spend about two hours with their text per week. They are also required to create a three to five minute presentation, to be shared with the full group. The group is also responsible for providing feedback on the presentation. The presentation ultimately evolves into a final paper of 8-10 pages that explores the line of inquiry from their text as it is instantiated in their work experience. Students are graded on their discussion (40\uff05), presentation (25\uff05), and final paper (35\uff05)",

Virtually everyone has traded stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Comparatively few individuals have ever traded foreign exchange. In part that is because foreign exchange is an interbank market. Ironically the foreign exchange markets may be the best place to trade derivatives and to invent new derivatives\u2014given the massive two-way flow of trading that goes through bank dealing rooms virtually 24 hours a day.

        "course_description": "\nFuture brides in novels present the common trait of insipidity. Amelia Sedley is said to be \"insipid\" multiple times in Vanity Fair; in Anna Karenina, Kitty is initially indistinguishable from her sisters; May in The Mill on the Floss is unremarkable; Pansy in Portrait of a Lady is \"a blank page\"; May in The Age of Innocence is \"so lacking in imagination, so incapable of growth\"\u2026 Counter-examples verify this rule: Natasha in War and Peace fulfills her destiny despite, not because of the extreme vividness of her soul: she can finally find peace when she gives up her beauty and her personality to become a full-time mother and a devoted wife. Unordinary female protagonists impede the traditional novel\u2019s happy ending. Too complex and spirited figures such as Anna Karenina, or Becky Sharp in Vanity Fair, are denied a destiny. Insipidity, if not a feature since the beginning of the story, is the final achievement of the perfect woman of the novel. Female insipidity is nonetheless enigmatic, and often goes along with great ideological and formal complexity. We will delve into this aspect by taking Lucia Mondella, the protagonist of Italy\u2019s great historical novel The Betrothed, as a point of reference for a comparison with other 2 famous maidens: Sophy Western, Pamela Andrews, Amelia Sedley, Elizabeth Bennet\u2026 We will read Alessandro Manzoni\u2019s masterpiece which, in its magnificent prose, tells a story made of impeded love, escapes, abductions, famine, plague, murderous nuns and pious peasants in 1628 Italy. Our reading will be focused on themes such as the female protagonist\u2019s use of speech, her wisdom, her devotion, her virtue, standards of beauty. We will compare Manzoni\u2019s invention with models from the early English novel (in particular Henry Fielding\u2019s Tom Jones and Samuel Richardson\u2019s Pamela) and from the novel contemporary to him (Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice, Thackeray\u2019s Vanity Fair, Flaubert\u2019s Madame Bovary, Bront\u00eb\u2019s Jane Eyre). Readings include classical and medieval sources as well (in particular some novellas from Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron), and the libertine literature that constituted Manzoni\u2019s contemporary cultural background. In addition to the readings, the syllabus takes into account two movies: Tony Richardson\u2019s Tom Jones, an adaptation of Fielding\u2019s novel, the most important model to The Betrothed, and Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Barry Lyndon. The course will end with a look at some Anglo-American novels that continued to question the tradition of the insipid woman. There are no prerequisites for this course. Students are welcome to read sources in the original language if they wish to do so; however, no knowledge of Italian is required",

The environment is an important part of cultural heritage too, with nature and its peculiar beauties. Similarly, practices, traditions, crafts and customs are a crucial component of cultural heritage. Over time, cultural heritage has become an increasingly broad and complex category: experts, scientists and professionals involved continue to multiply, and the disciplines continue to specialize. Even the very concept of cultural heritage is quite dynamic and frequently modified and reinterpreted. Based on an anthropological perspective and within the framework of a cultural heritage considered among the most valuable in the arts, both visual and literary, Italy\u2019s artistic, archaeological, library and archival treasures will be a regular source of analysis and discussion. This course will examine ways in which we can understand cultural heritage through the intersections of several components: identity, nationalism, colonialism, ethnicity, gender, and religion, just to mention a few. Students will take into account several elements: how regional and international agencies and policies operate and interact with each other, the many threats to cultural heritage (wars and conflicts, natural disasters, climate change, illicit trafficking, and some forms of tourism), and the role of sustainability.

This course examines the various ways in which these individuals have used music to perform and inscribe, symbolize, describe, and editorialize antisemitism. In so doing, it focuses on musicking\u2014a term that encompasses all musical activity from composing to performing to listening\u2014in the realms of art music, popular music, and non-Western traditions, as well as of genres that synthesize different styles. It also draws on sound, including language and speech as well as writings such as Wagner\u2019s Judenthum in der Musik (1848\u221250/69) and Carl Engel\u2019s The Music of the Most Ancient Nations (1864). All of these will serve as a window through which to address the types of Jew-hatred that have become known since the mid-nineteenth century as antisemitism\u2014religious, national and ethnic, political, populist, economic, and institutional\u2014as well as hate speech or \u201chate talk\u201d and the Jewish responses to it. A basic familiarity with music is helpful for this course, but it is not required as long as there is an openness to listening to music and a commitment to basic aural analysis. You do not need to know Jewish history to take this class, nor do you need to be able to read music. Translations will be provided, and musical analysis will be well explained.

This seminar will introduce students to a far longer history of the many social, cultural, political, and economic encounters and entanglements between Jews and Muslims that spans centuries and continents. We will nuance narratives of both Jews and the Middle East as we move both chronologically and thematically to trace the experiences of Jews in Arabia before and with the rise of Islam, and how Jews and Muslims shaped the theology and religious literature of one another. We will examine how the Islamic conquests brought about the need to create an institutional framework for minorities, and the histories of Jewish communities under various Islamic caliphates, moving from Babylonia, to the eastern Mediterranean, and al-Andalus (Islamic Spain). Following Sephardic Jews with their expulsion in 1492, we will trace the formation of a Sephardic diaspora across the Ottoman Empire and North Africa. Finally, we will chart modern transformations in Jewish-Muslim encounters in daily life, popular culture, religious practice, and political movements. In doing so, we will consider their encounters as part of more global and interregional processes in the Middle East and beyond, such as colonialism, imperialism, nationalism, the formation of modern nation states in the Middle East, and the Israeli-Arab conflict. Through reading scholarly literature and analyzing primary documents\u2014including letters and petitions, newspapers and state records, literature, music, and photography\u2014this course guides students in thinking like historians, reading texts, and formulating interpretations. By centering a wide range of historical voices, we will examine how encounters between Jews and Muslims were shaped by gender, class, race, religious practice, and regionality. In taking our guiding frameworks and approaches from different disciplines and fields, including history, anthropology, visual culture, and postcolonial studies, we will work to better understand the long history of Jewish-Muslim encounters in the Middle East and beyond",

Theories of grammar built on English serve such languages poorly. This course seeks to address this imbalance by focusing on languages with complex morphological and morphosyntactic structures. Because the grammars of such languages are built around word structures, we will be exploring current lexicalist theories of grammar such as Lexical Functional Grammar and Construction Grammar to develop formal explicit analyses of these languages. One learns morphological and morphosyntactic analysis by doing it across languages of various types, so we will regularly be working through problems to analyze in class",

The Islamic world stretches across a remarkable geographical expanse from modern Spain and Senegal in the west to the north of modern India in the east. Telling one cohesive story out of many histories is therefore challenging, even if we had a full lifetime to devote to it. We cannot include everything and, as with every complicated story worth knowing, what we choose to exclude is important. This semester, we bypass some of the traditional narratives of political and military history, which privilege the rise and fall of dynasties, the rule of great men, and the clashes of armies. We will still organize along political lines, but the focus of our conversations will be the incredible diversity of the various communities in the Islamic world. We approach these histories through primary sources\u2014 poems, coins, buildings, etc.\u2014that we will read together in every class meeting. Our goal will be to situate each source in the political, cultural, and religious contexts of its production. This approach will allow us to appreciate premodern Islamic worlds through the centuries. Through the assignments and conversations in class and section, students will Explore the diversity of premodern Islam; Analyze primary sources produced in the Islamic world before 1500, both individually and as a class; Engage with modern scholarship about Islam in India and Central Asia; the Middle East; North, West, and East Africa; and Southern Europe; Construct a source-based argument about the Islamic world before 1500",

The survey considers theories of ethnicity and race, as well as their critics, and includes cases from the Ancient World (c. 1000 BCE) through the Old Regime (c. 1800 CE). Students in this course will gain a familiarity with major theories of social difference and alterity, and utilize them to interpret and analyze controversial debates about social politics and identity from the history of the Middle East, including ancient ethnicity, historical racism, Arab identity, pluralism in the Islamic Empire, and slavery, among others. In addition, students will spend much of the semester developing a specialized case study of their own on a historical community of interest.

The course allows an insight into the diversity of religious ideas and practices in the region, historical variations, influence of colonialism and the relationship with globalization. We will engage with scholarship on these themes from the disciplines of history, anthropology and political science. Prior familiarity with the region is not required. By the end of this course, students should be able to: -understand recent debates social sciences regarding conceptualizing and defining religion -understand the limitations of previous frameworks for assessing the role of religion in political processes across South Asia -recognize key transformations in different religious traditions across South Asia. -develop a nuanced and critical approach to analysing religion and politics more generally",

How did a man with such views come to have such an immense effect on history? In some ways, Gandhi is an excellent entry into the complex history of modern India - its contradictions, achievements, failures, possibilities. This course will be primarily a course on social theory, focusing on texts and discursive exchanges between various perceptions of modernity in India. It will have two parts: the first part will be based on reading Gandhi\u2019s own writings; the second, on the writings of his main interlocutors. It is hoped that through these exchanges students will get a vivid picture of the intellectual ferment in modern India, and the main lines of social and political thought that define its intellectual culture.

This course traces the profoundly important roles that literature and other cultural production (music, photography, film, comics, Twitter hashtags like #rhodesmustfall and #feesmustfall) have played in struggle against apartheid and its lingering afterlife. Although many of our texts were originally written in English, we will also discuss the historical forces, including nineteenth-century Christian missions and Bantu Education, as well as South Africa's post-1994 commitment to being a multilingual democracy, that have shaped the linguistic texture of South African cultural life.",

In this course, we will approach these questions and more from a South-centered perspective introducing students to some of the histories, debates, and questions on the subject. This course surveys histories of Imperialism in South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa in the 18th and 19th centuries. The course is divided into three units reflecting cases from the three regions while focusing on different historical periods. First, we will study British imperialism in India in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. For the second unit, we will focus on the case of Egypt and its occupation in the late 19th century. Third, we will examine the British Empire in West Africa and East Africa at the turn of the century. Each unit will touch on three themes with various degrees of focus. First, we will ask why imperialism? explaining the different reasons and dynamics for imperialist expansion in the three regions. In the second theme, we will examine the political economy of colonial rule and how it manifested differently over time and space. In the third theme, we will explore social change, resistance, and questions of labor in colonial settings. The course will also serve to introduce students to using primary materials in their studies, using documents varying from contracts, laws, newspaper articles, reports, and correspondences.

Relying on multi-disciplinary and post-disciplinary scholarship, and employing a wealth of audiovisual material, literary works, and interviews conducted by the instructor, the course scrutinizes how conflicts have impacted urban life in the Middle East, and how civilians react to, confront, and resist militarization in urban spaces",

As the heroes (and heroines) of these epics are often linked with the people producing and/or narrating them, the manner in which these epics are articulated reveals the priorities of its authors. Drawing on literature, film, graphic novels, journalism, podcasts, art, and performance, this class will explore the continuous reworking of these epics from their inception to the present day.

While always using the past as a background, a source and repository of recollections, the challenge of the 2003 Anglo-America invasion and its institutionalization of segregation and rupture to keep Iraq in perpetual chaos, is present in the texts. Every narrative sheds light on a number of issues, especially war, horror, loss, trauma, passion and dislocation. This richness in detail is brought up through a number of stylistic innovations that put this writing at the forefront of world cultures and human concerns. An introductory lecture builds up a genealogy for trauma since the Epic of Gilgamesh (2700 BC.) and the lamentations of Astarte",

Muslim and Middle Eastern intellectuals have long grappled with the role of Islam in the modern polity. Their often-contested engagements with this question have deeply shaped the political life of the region. In this course, you will explore the genealogy of these debates by analyzing the issues they brought to the fore: the nature of the modern Islamic community, Islam\u2019s relationship to Western imperialism, the challenges posed by the postcolonial nation-state, as well as the various political theologies at play in Islamist movements, in \u201cliberal\u201d conceptions of Islamic doctrines, and in Muslim states\u2019 interpretations of religion. The class follows the intellectual history of the \u201cIslam and Politics\u201d dyad. Students will mostly read primary sources produced by individuals who lived in the Middle East in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: political essays, theological writings, legal texts, constitutions, parliamentary debates, autobiographies. The aim of the course is to examine the thought of Muslim intellectuals who have written about the role of religion in politics and society. Students will learn about the politics of the Middle East by understanding the views, claims, and textual productions of Middle Easterners themselves. This exposure to primary texts will give them a deep understanding of the issues related to religion and politics in the Middle East today. Please note that this course is for students who are interested in critically and academically engaging with the issue of Islam and politics. Discussions will be firmly rooted in history, the humanities and the social sciences. This is neither a course on Political Islam (Islamism) nor a survey of the history of religion and politics throughout the entire Middle East. Secondary literature in English will be assigned, as well as primary sources in English translation. There will be opportunities to read and comment on Arabic primary sources as well, depending on students\u2019 reading abilities",

This course in MESAAS will introduce students to the literature on climate change and its relationship to ontology, religion, violence, politics, and gender. We will explore the resilience and limitations of various theoretical approaches as they relate to empirical cases. Students will become familiarized with important arguments that have been advanced to explain climate change in its more recent incarnations in the Middle East and Asia. How have different trajectories of understanding climate change led to different kinds of political cultures and governing institutions? Have some qualities of the \u201cenvironment\u201d or \u201cclimate\u201d remained the same throughout history and across the globe? What is the role of colonialism in modern understandings of climate change? The core of this course will seek to develop a mode of conceptualizing the present by rendering relevant geological time in addition to historical time, earth\u2019s history in addition to world\u2019s history. The course begins with the question of how the \u201cclimate\u201d has been historically and ethnographically conceptualized in various intellectual trajectories of human sciences. We consider how religion is connected to environmental change, how the \u201chuman\u201d and \u201cnon human\u201d are conceptualized in various ontologies, and how religious norms and ethics enact environmental practices. We interrogate the everyday sociality of climate adaption and how climate conflict informs social, political, and environmental citizenship. The course concludes by contemplating the creative ways of being in this new world. We study the innovative forms of cosmopolitan neo-humanism (post- humanism) that emerge from the specter of environmental change",

        "course_description": "\nThe historical significance of Marx lies not only in his reception in Germany or Europe, but across the world. But Marx\u2019s thought emerged from a highly specific intellectual context of European thought. Therefore, reading Marx must have a contextual, German and European side, and, equally, a global reception side. The purpose of this course will be to read Marx\u2019s texts closely, and to follow the trajectory of his ideas historically and therefore globally. In one sense, we understand what \u2018doing\u2019 political theory means more clearly in studying the struggles of Marx\u2019s readers in addressing the question: how can reading Marx illuminate the historical analysis of very different societies \u2013 societies which were not in Europe, societies which were not based on a capitalist economy, societies that were not yet \u2018modern\u2019 in their economy, politics and culture. A part of the course will be about the Marxism of the \u2018others\u2019: American Black thinkers, and thinkers in China, India, Africa, the Middle East. To follow Marx\u2019s thought historically is to read his thought globally. The course will be in three parts. The first part will read some texts of Western social theory from which the central questions of Marx\u2019s theoretical reflections were drawn. Following a method of Indian philosophy in which philosophic arguments are always read in relation to its purvapaksha (arguments in response to which the philosophical doctrine was conceived and elaborated), we shall start with questions first introduced in Hobbes (individual) Locke (property and its relation to government) and Adam Smith (capitalism) in the British tradition, and Hegel (on history and capitalism) and Feuerbach (religion and estrangement) in the German tradition. We shall explore the central arguments from these thinkers which Marx contends with \u2013 at times accepting and elaborating them, or modifying them, or directly questioning and rejecting them. In the second part of the course, we shall closely read some texts from Marx, but also pair them with some of the major readings of their meanings from the Marxist tradition. Texts read will include the early journalistic writings, Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, Communist Manifesto, the Grundrisse, political writings, Capital and Theories of Surplus Value, reflections on non-European history on the basis of his notes on \u2018pre-capitalist formations\u2019 and ethnological manuscripts. In the final part of the course, we shall read major texts which show the different kinds of readings Marx\u2019s work received in different parts of the world: Russian Communists, Asian Marxists from India and China, from the Middle east and Islamic societies, and from Africa. We shall end by readings of Marx from the West\u2019s most intimate enemy: Black Marxists. Reading Marx historically is impossible without reading Marx globally. This section will also, necessarily, engage in more abstract questions about how we should read thought systems which originate in a particular thought ecology, but then circulates to entirely different settings of reading and political action",

A poetics of prose gives these narratives the power of literary production that makes them more readable, appealing, and provocative than ordinary journalistic reporting.\n\nThrough close readings\u00a0 of \u00a0a number of\u00a0 Arabic war novels and\u00a0 some long narrative poems, this course \u00a0proposes to\u00a0 address war in its varieties\u00a0 not only as liberation movements in\u00a0 Algeria and Palestine,\u00a0 but also\u00a0 as an engagement with\u00a0 invasions, as in\u00a0 Iraqi narratives of war, or\u00a0 as conflict as was the case between Iran and Iraq, 1980-1988,\u00a0 as proxy wars in other parts of the region , or \u2018civil\u2019 wars generated and perpetuated by big powers. Although writers are no longer the leaders of thought as in the first half of the 20th century, they resume different roles of exposition, documentation, reinstatement of identities, and geographical and topographical orientation. Narrators and protagonists are not spectators but implicated individuals whose voices give vent to dreams, desires, intimations, and expectations. They are not utterly passive, however. Behind bewilderment and turbulence, there is a will to expose atrocity and brutality. Writing is an effort to regain humanity in an inhuman situation.\n\nThe course is planned under thematic and theoretical divisions:\u00a0one\u00a0 that takes\u00a0 writing as a deliberate exposure\u00a0 of the censored and repressed;\u00a0another\u00a0as\u00a0 a counter shock and awe strategy [ implemented under this name in the wars on Iraq]\u00a0\u00a0 whereby brutalities are laid bare; and a\u00a0third\u00a0\u00a0that claims reporting\u00a0 in order to explore its limits and complicity.

While the history of modern state in Armenian experience is a crucial aspect of the course, it also places a substantial focus on understanding Armenians as an intersectional community crossing imperial, national, and regional boundaries and belongings.

We will focus on human-animal relations and animalization/dehumanization of humans in literary works by prominent Hebrew authors, including M.Y. Berdichevsky, Devorah Baron, S.Y. Agnon, Amos Oz, David Grossman, Orly Castel-Bloom, Almog Behar, Etgar Keret, and Sayed Kashua. Employing posthumanist and ecofeminist theoretical lenses, we will analyze the bio-political intersections of species and gender, as well as animalization as a process of otherization of marginalized ethnic groups. Throughout the course, we will ask questions, such as: why animals abound in Modern Hebrew literature? Are they merely metaphors for intra-human issues, or rather count as subjects? What literary devices are used to portray animals? How has the depiction of human-animal relations changed in Hebrew over the last 150 years? How do cultural and political frameworks inform representations of human-animal relations? No prior knowledge of Hebrew is required; all readings and class discussions will be in English.

The course will explore kinship, intimacy, and friendship ties in a dynamic age where sexual and gender diversity is a hallmark of neoliberal \u2018secular\u2019 modernity, whose advent historically exposed all non-Europeans, to a plethora of false competing dualisms, such as secular/religious and heterogeneity/homogeneity, as well as discourses such as homonationalism (al-qawmiyyat al-m\u012bthl\u012byat) and pinkwashing (al-ghaseel al-banafsajiy).

However, in recent years, we have witnessed a boom of historical writing on post-independence India. In this class, we will analyze this emerging scholarship and focus on the themes of democracy and majoritarianism. We will read about the establishment of universal franchise in 1950s India, the writing and implementation of the constitution, and the country\u2019s experiments with various economic plans. At the same time, we will study the Indian state\u2019s often violent integration of regions originally outside Britain\u2019s direct domain, including the princely states of Kashmir and Hyderabad, and the development of what scholars have described as new forms of colonialism in the region after 1947. Likewise, we will study the growth of majoritarian ideologies and the continued struggle against caste oppression, all while considering India\u2019s place in the larger Cold War.

        "course_description": "\nIn the tenth century, the Jewish physician Hasdai b. Shaprut wrote a letter in Hebrew from his home in Islamic Spain. He asked about the veracity of the stories he had heard from Khorasani merchants: could it be true that a Jewish empire existed far afield that could hold its own against the Roman Empire and Islamic Caliphate alike? The response to Hasdai\u2019s query was discovered in the geniza of the synagogue in Old Cairo, answering in the affirmative. Some modern scholars read the correspondence as evidence of the Jewish empire; others dismiss the correspondence as the same vein of the Prester John narratives among European Christians or, worse, an anti-Semitic theory about Jewish control over trade routes. For both medieval and modern observers, the line between fact and fiction in the history of this empire has never been particularly clear. In the modern world, the ethnonym \u201cKhazar\u201d has been coopted into anti-Semitic discourse. While this course will trace the changing meaning of the term, we will focus mainly on the medieval Khazars themselves. The Khazar Khaganate\u2014an empire that stretched over eastern Europe and the north Caucasus from the eighth to the tenth centuries\u2014caught the imagination of historians, litterateurs, missionaries, and philosophers over the centuries. The extant evidence about the Khaganate is vast, but usually contradictory, frequently sensationalist, and invariably contested. Given the sheer quantity of information preserved about the Khazars, narrating their history becomes an exercise in imaginative reflection. As a result, this course offers a deep dive into the extant sources, asking what practical challenges emerge from reading the contested history of the Khaganate across the wide array of Greek, Arabic, Persian, Georgian, Armenian, and Hebrew sources. After engaging with the sources available for Khazar history, the last few meetings of the class will open the conversation to potential models for embracing medieval imagination and grappling with modern accretions to Khazar histories",

This course will introduce you to popular music studies, a field of inquiry that draws scholars from a number of different disciplines, including musicology, sociology, philosophy, anthropology and literature. Examining rock music in an interdisciplinary way has opened the genre to increasing attention beyond musicological methodologies and assumptions. First, however, we must ask some fundamental questions: for instance, what, exactly, is popular music as well as, importantly, what differentiates rock music from other genres? Our definitions will reveal some of the assumptions we bring to any discussion of popular music. Throughout this semester, we will question our assumptions about rock music culture through an investigation into a series of keywords. Each keyword will focus our attention on various aspects of rock music in order to think through the complexities of what might, on the surface, seem self-evident. Terms such as \u201cgenre\u201d or \u201cthe everyday\u201d will be examined to help us gain critical analytical tools with which to assess various rock music productions, artists, and processes",

This class is for instrumentalists who wish to deepen their understanding of the theory, history and practice of jazz improvisation. The history of jazz will be used as a prism through which to view approaches to improvisation, from the cadences of the early Blues through the abstractions of Free Jazz and beyond.

A major composer whose short life-span and delayed posterity skewed the trajectory of musical Romanticism during and after Beethoven, Schubert wrote a string of masterworks in his later years, including the String Quartets in D minor (\u201cDeath and the Maiden\u201d) and G major, the dark song cycle Die Winterreise, the Impromptus and last three Sonatas for piano, the String Quintet in C, the Fantasy in F minor, and the two Piano Trios. His notably artistic friendship circle, his tangential relationship to patronage, and his extraordinary cultivation of chamber genres (including the Lied), reveal him to have had a Viennese career during the 1820s very different from that of Beethoven at the same time. Schubert\u2019s illness and diagnosis with syphilis in late 1822 produced a crisis of creativity still relevant for scholars and students today, as the literature reveals: analyzing biography and art under the sign of death produces tensions we will explore in the course.",

This course explores the ongoing search for the brain correlates of mental disorders and the significant impact this search has had on our contemporary understanding of mental health. Engaging with review and research papers on schizophrenia, autism spectrum, and mood disorders, students will learn to interpret experimental evidence in Neuroscience and to evaluate known theories through both supporting and non-supporting evidence. While the course acknowledges neuroscience's progress in understanding mental disorders, it also considers some of the problems encountered in viewing them as essentially biological phenomena: Can brain-based explanations capture the lived experience of mental disorders? Could these disorders also originate from outside the brain? How should they be treated, and should they be always treated?

We will examine the similarities and differences between these states of altered perception both at the level of phenomenology and underlying biological mechanisms, specifically focusing on neural oscillations.

Today, questions not only concerning \u2018what the world is like\u2019 but also philosophical queries into theory of knowledge and meaning, metaphysics, ethics, and philosophy of mind defer to the sciences and the scientific method. But what makes science an epistemically and ontologically privileged enterprise? What relation does science maintain to philosophy? What arguments are there for different kinds of naturalism? In this course, we will ask these questions, both with a focus on efforts to naturalize the mind and an eye toward the historical context in which these efforts developed. We will explore the relationship between naturalizing psychological properties and physicalism, the relationship between naturalism and representationalism, phenomenological critiques of naturalism, and proposed alternatives to naturalism",

We will then consider what science in particular tells us about the very far future, where we will encounter the likely demise of all complex matter, all life and all consciousness.

Students will learn what is and is not unique about the current historical moment, and how history might shape our expectations of parties moving forward.\n\nThroughout the course, we will pay particularly close attention to the roots of contemporary party polarization, and the implications of this phenomenon for representation and governance. In 1950, the American Political Science Association released a report criticizing the two major parties for excessive similarity; today, party polarization evokes widespread concern.

We will examine these kinds of questions broadly, and also consider how they play out in particular policy areas and historical moments.

The aggregation of preferences or choices is usually governed by some set of institutional rules, formal or informal. Our main themes include the rationality of individual and group preferences, the underpinnings and implications of using majority rule, tradeoffs between aggregation methods, the fairness of group choice, the effects of institutional constraints on choice (e.g. agenda control), and the implications for democratic choice. Most of the course material is highly abstract, but these abstract issues turn up in many real-world problems, from bargaining between the branches of government to campus elections to judicial decisions on multi-member courts to the allocation of relief funds among victims of natural disasters to the scoring of Olympic events.

Traditionally, kleptocracy has been viewed as a scourge on developing countries, associated with greedy authoritarian rulers in conflict-prone, resource rich and/or aid dependent states. However, in recent years scholars and policymakers have increasingly become aware of the critical role played by international actors, institutions, legal structures and professional service providers that facilitate kleptocracy at a global level. Unlike other transnational illicit sectors such as narcotics trafficking or terrorism, many aspects of kleptocracy networks are publicly visible and perfectly legal. Overall, these networks function to enable the domestic plundering of these elites, the whitewashing of their reputations, and the exacerbation of vast inequality, both within the countries that kleptocrats systemically plunder and between the Global South and the West which receives and benefits from many of the proceeds of these corrupt activities. The first part of the course (Weeks 2-5) examines the transnational actors, service professionals and institutions that facilitate money laundering by kleptocrats. The second part (Weeks 6-7) concentrates on how kleptocrats launder their reputations, by presenting themselves as global philanthropists or business professionals and by acquiring residency in other jurisdictions through the growing market for citizenship. The final part of the course (Weeks 8-10) examines recent developments in international policy efforts to counter kleptocracy, including incorporating such efforts into national security strategies, enacting extraterritorial legislation to punish corporate bribery, sanctioning individual kleptocrats and oligarchs, and amending libel laws in countries like the UK that are routinely used by kleptocrats to intimidate journalists and deter investigations into their dealings. Finally, throughout the course we will grapple with the methodological challenges posed by trying to study and detect illegal and secretive patterns of behavior. What are the tools, resources and research techniques available to researchers and policy makers interested in making more evidence-based assessments about kleptocracy and grand corruption?",

        "course_description": "\nIn recent decades, economic inequality in the United States has soared to levels not seen for nearly a century: Wages for workers have stagnated, while the proportion of wealth concentrated among the most well-off Americans has steadily increased. These trends may have dire consequences for the state of representative democracy in the United States, as they endow a relatively small number of citizens with a disproportionate amount of resources to deploy politically. The result is a political system that often responds to the preferences of the wealthiest Americans, while frequently ignoring the views of most ordinary citizens. This course, in diverse ways, explores the political causes and consequences of rising inequality, especially with regards to who has political power. We will begin by examining the contours of inequality in the U.S. while also exploring the various ways that power manifests itself in politics. We\u2019ll then explore the relationship between wealth and public policy outcomes in the United States, along with the ways that the very wealthiest Americans \u2013 both individually and collectively \u2013 work to advance their policy views. Beyond just examining national-level politics, we will also discuss inequality and power on the state- and local-levels. We\u2019ll then explore how political and economic inequality are interrelated with race and social class, and how all of this connects to the rise of Donald Trump. Finally, we will assess potential remedies to political and economic inequality",

        "course_description": "\nA major challenge for governments across the Western Hemisphere is the complex relationship between illicit drugs, violence, and politics. We can see this relationship operating at multiple levels, from everyday politics in gang-controlled neighborhoods to the global arenas where governments debate and craft international drug policy. These links also reach back in history to global wars of empire and colonial rule, race relations during and following the collapse of the institution of slavery, and contemporary drug wars being waged across the Western Hemisphere and other parts of the world. Today, the dynamics and consequences of the politics of illicit drugs touch all our lives in different ways, including individual and family struggles with substance abuse, everyday encounters with militarized police, and the strains on democracy and citizenship, among many others. This course will examine some of these dynamics and consequences with a theoretical and empirical focus mainly on Latin America and the United States. Throughout our time together we will connect these pressing issues to broader theories, concepts and empirical findings in political science. The course is divided into several individual modules (denoted below with the headings A \u2013 G) under three overarching themes for this semester: 1. Politics of Drugs in a Historical Perspective: The first theme is a broad historical overview of the political origins of illicit drugs and the global drug regime. Some of the main questions we will tackle are: When and why did states label drugs as illicit? How did domestic and global politics come together to shape the global drug regime and the \u201cwar on drugs?\u201d What role did race and gender play in the early social construction of illicit drugs? 2. Illicit Drugs, Politics and Governance: The second theme focuses on contemporary linkages between illicit drugs, violence, and politics. Here we will examine the conditions under which illicit drug markets are either violent or (relatively) peaceful. We will tackle questions like: Do states always seek to dismantle drug markets? What is the relationship between illicit drugs and electoral politics? What role do illicit drugs play in governance by armed non-state actors? Are states and criminal actors involved in the drug trade always at \u201cwar\u201d with each other? 3. Democracy, Citizenship, and the War on Drugs: The third and final theme centers on the political consequences of the war on drugs for questions of democracy and citizenship in the Western Hemisphere. Some of the questions that will help us make sense of these consequences are: How does the war on drugs impact democracy and citizenship? What is the political economy of imprisonment? And in what ways do imprisonment and police-citizen interactions \u2013 stemming from the war on drugs \u2013 shape individual and collective political behavior and political subjectivity?",

In the last two centuries, some countries successfully achieved economic growth and development, while other failed to do so. Even in the post-WWII period, the world has witnessed the rise and decline of economies around the world. Why do nations succeed or fail in economic development? How do political institutions affect economic outcomes? What are the ways in which state and market interact and influence each other? Can democracy be considered a cause of development, an outgrowth of development, or neither and to which extent? How do external factors such as foreign aid encourage or discourage development? We will try to examine these questions by taking a historical-institutional and comparative approach and take a critical look at the role of political and other institutions by applying theoretical guidelines and empirical cases. We will explore competing explanations for the successes and failures of economic development in the world. Objective:1. Understand some important concepts and theories within the fields of comparative politics and political economy. To explore the interconnections between politics, economy, and society in the context of development policy and practice.2. Develop basic analytic skills to explore various factors that shape political, economic, and social development and underdevelopment in the world;3.

This course is designed to encourage students to think deeply about the relationship between ethnicity and politics. We will consider several questions. First, why does ethnicity become politicized? We investigate this question by examining nationalist secessionism and ethnic conflict\u2014phenomena that mushroomed at the end of the Cold War. We will focus on East Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, devoting special attention to the cases of Yugoslavia, the USSR, Moldova, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and Chechnya. However, we will also study cases in which the dog didn\u2019t bark, i.e. places where nationalist mobilization and ethnic violence either did not occur, or emerged and then receded as in the ethnic republics of the Russian Federation (including the \u201cMuslim\u201d regions of Tatarstan and Bashkortostan, etc.). In the second part of the course, we will analyze ethnic politics after independent statehood was achieved throughout the post-Soviet space. How do nationalist state-builders try to construct a nation and a state at the same time? Have they incorporated or discriminated against minorities living within \u201ctheir\u201d states? How have ethnic minorities responded? We will study Ukraine, the Baltics and Kazakhstan where ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking populations form large portions of the population, devoting particular attention to the crisis in Ukraine. We will also examine how the post-conflict regions of Bosnia and Kosovo have dealt with ethnic pluralism. These cases allow us to gain greater understanding of how multi-ethnic states use forms of federalism, consociationalism, and power-sharing as state-building strategies",

No less prominent will be discussions of two military interventions by Russia seeking to keep Ukraine its its sphere of influence, the annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist conflict in the Donbas in 2014, and the full-blown invasion in 2022, and the Ukrainian state and society\u2019s responses to these interventions",

The Sunni-Shia rivalry, especially between Saudi Arabia and Iran, growing Iranian-Israeli conflict, population explosion, poverty and authoritarian control, Russian ascendance and US retrenchment, are the primary regional drivers today. Together, these factors have transformed the Middle Eastern landscape, with great consequence for the national security of the countries of the region and their foreign relations. The primary source of the worlds energy resources, the Middle East remains the locus of the terror-WMD-fundamentalist nexus, which continues to pose a significant threat to both regional and international security. The course surveys the national security challenges facing the regions primary players (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, the Palestinians and Turkey,) and how the convolutions of recent years have affected them. Unlike many Middle East courses, which focus on US policy in the region, the course concentrates on the regional players perceptions of the threats and opportunities they face and the strategies they have adopted to deal with them.

The third and final unit builds upon this analysis to demonstrate the multi-disciplinary, multi-level approach required to effectively address global health priorities, and the political and organizational cooperation required to achieve this.

Today the scales of authoritative power to inform us about our collective futures seem to have shifted, many would say properly so, in favor of the sciences. Promises about the future, however, are never just predictions which may or may not come to pass. They are claims to power and authority (who has the power to describe and create the future), expressions of values (what kinds of dispositions, attitudes, and behaviors are considered proper in this future), and producers of future social worlds (who is permitted to participate in this future). Whether or not science discourses are attuned to it, the sciences have learned a lot from religion when it comes to selling salvation. Therefore, we do well to study the various intersections of science, technology, society, and religion. In this course, we will examine the utopian claims of science and technology, both past and present, to explore and understand how that authority is produced and structured, the kinds of values encoded within these claims, and the people, things, entities, and institutions who are included in or excluded from these potential futures. This course specifically aims to equip students with the ability to discern claims about the future, understand what is lurking between the lines, critically examine its consequences and intentions, and contextualize such claims about the future within alternative or competing claims, all in the hope that such critical attention produces visions of the future, and assemblages of science and technology, which are more democratic, just, and equitable",

While no hard and fast rules for thinking about the relationship between right conduct and material interests cut across all religious and philosophical traditions, human agents invest real faith into currency, into markets, and into the reigning economic order to bring about increased opportunities, wealth, and freedom to people across the globe.

To this end, our syllabus will be split into three units, each anchored by a particular theorist central to the academic study of religion (Max Weber, Karl Marx, and Michel Foucault) and followed by a number of case study texts that will bring their constructs and lenses into more lively debate and discussion.",

Our guiding questions will be: What does religion have to do with queerness? What does queerness have to do with religion? Queer theory and activists, unless they already identify as religious, often have little or little good to say about religion. Conversely, many religious traditions intensively regulate gender, sex, sexuality, and especially queerness. this course will explore how religious studies can enrich queer theory and how queer theory can reshape our thinking about religious studies. But beyond the mutual disinterest, anxieties, and animosities, queer studies and religious studies share actually a whole range of core interests and questions, such as embodiment, sexuality, gender-variability, coloniality, race appearing as religious identity and religious identity as gendered, as well as the role of catastrophe, utopia, and redemption in our experience of the world. We will examine questions about religion come to the fore when we paying especially attention to queerness, gender, sexuality, pleasure, pain, and desire. Equally, we will examine how queer discourses mobilize religious and theological images and ideas, especially where these images and ideas are no longer clearly recognizable as having religious origins. Rather than trying to settle on definitive answers, this course will cultivate a process of open-ended collective inquiry in which students will be encouraged to think autonomously and challenge facile solutions. Students should come away from the course with an expanded sense of how we grapple with issues related to gender, sexuality, desire, and embodiment in our everyday lives and how religion and religious formations are entangled with these issues well beyond religious communities.

Moreover, when queerness and religion are studied together, we usually take queerness primarily as a quality of lives, bodies, and desires and then study how religious traditions and discourses succeed or fail in targeting or supporting queer lives or studies articulate how religious traditions can be recovered through queer readings. We will inquire into the shapes and logics animating queer theory\u2019s religion trouble and wonder about what ways of thinking we preempt when queerness and religion are confined to pertaining to lived bodies and traditions respectively.

We try to make sense of these by interpreting them. The art or science of interpretation \u2013 \u201chermeneutics\u201d after Hermes \u2013 has a long history in Asia and in the West. Buddhism itself has a tradition of hermeneutics, as does each of the Western religious traditions and Western philosophy and law, starting with Plato and Aristotle, becoming \u201cromantic\u201d with Schleiermacher, and \u201cmodern\u201d with Heidegger, Gadamer, and Ricoeur. Today\u2019s Western hermeneutics has become largely de-regionalized from specific subject areas, and has been extended to the interpretation of all human experience. After a grounding in traditional Buddhist and Western hermeneutic principles, we will focus on a number of aspects of Buddhism, including the central question of whether there is a \u201cself\u201d or not, and on esoteric Buddhist yoga, Tantra, central to several of the better-known forms of Buddhism today, including Tibetan Buddhism. Here we will witness the confluence and, sometimes, collision of traditional Buddhist and Tantric hermeneutics focusing in large part on \u201cspiritual\u201d concerns, and the Western tradition, with its emphasis on economics, power, and gender. In thinking about which interpretations are \u201cright\u201d -- indeed, whether any interpretation can be \u201cright,\u201d and, if so, \"how much?\" -- we will consider the cultures in which these scriptures and practices originated, as well as ourselves and our own contemporary perspectives, insights, presuppositions and prejudices. A primary concern of hermeneutics is the interpretation of so-called \"objective\" physical and subjective mental realities. In thinking about the hermeneutics of outer and inner time and space, towards the end of the semester we will consider whether the \"objective\" and the \"subjective\" intersect, how much, and look at some descriptions of quantum mechanics and the role of observation of physical reality there, and analogize and contrast those to and with some Buddhist systems of philosophy and practice",

The PWR\u2019s American location broadens Tomoko Masuzawa\u2019s magisterial description of the \u201cinvention of world religions\u201d by initially shifting attention away from its European base. It also introduces us to the element of display involved in announcing this idea and to one of its most important institutional partners: the University of Chicago. (2) In the second part of the course we investigate the consolidation/invention of the conceptual entities that comprise \u201cworld religions,\u201d as well as debates about just how many of them they are, and by what principle of accounting: To exemplify the production of \u201cisms\u201d that are said to comprise the world religions, we investigate the conceptual origins of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, the Judeo-Christian Tradition, and most recently The Indigenous. (3) At the end we consider an institution founded around the idea of World Religions\u2014Harvard\u2019s Center for the Study of World Religions\u2014and wonder how it compares to what has been done at Columbia and its neighbor institutions in New York: the Interfaith Center of New York, the Jewish Theological Seminary, and Union Theological Seminary. (4) The course includes a workshop (2/21) in which we discuss various materials we might use if we ourselves were asked to teach a \u201cworld religions\u201d course. We conclude with a mini-conference (4/24) in which you present your work and respond to that of others. There are two possibilities for the sort of work you might do, as listed below. Whichever you choose, please discuss your intentions with me by Friday, February 23. A two-page proposal and draft bibliography are due by midnight that day. OPTIONS: (a) You can do a research paper on some aspect of the course\u2014possibly extending to areas about which we have not specifically read and talked. (b) Or, if you wish, you can design your own World Religions course, providing a syllabus with all its constituent parts and a 7-8 double-spaced paper explaining why you have structured the course as you have. Be sure to say how you envision the group of students you\u2019ll be working with. As part of your preparation, discuss the contents and approach of your course with members\u2014or in some way affiliates (even apostates!)\u2014of at least three of the religious groups or traditions involved",

In recent years, scholars across the humanities, social sciences, and physical sciences have suggested that the climate crisis dates to the advent of European colonialism in the 16th and 17th centuries. This literature argues that colonial projects involved the remaking of landscapes via \u201cterraforming,\u201d seeking to inscribe European imaginaries on the land and extract value from it, while violently suppressing and destroying local and Indigenous lifeworlds. At the same time, a longstanding body of literature has investigated the relationship between colonialism and religion, focusing on missionary efforts to remake religious subjects and subjectivities and draw boundaries between true religion and its opposites, \u201cpaganism\u201d and \u201csuperstition.\u201d This course seeks to understand these two processes within the same frame, examining how colonial projects entailed simultaneous efforts to subjugate, extract value from, and transform people and landscapes. By the end of the semester, students will have deepened and nuanced their understandings of climate, religion, and colonialism, and come away with new ways of thinking about the climate crisis",

The course begins by placing the controversies surrounding the visual depiction of Muhammad in historical perspective (Gruber). This is followed by an examination of modern portrayals of Muslims in film that highlights both the vilification of the \u201cother\u201d (Shaheen) and the persistence of colonial discourses centered on the \u201cnative informant\u201d (Mamdani). Particular emphasis is given to recent pop cultural works that challenge these simplistic discourses of Islam. The second half of the course revisits Muhammad, employing an anthropological framework (Asad) to understand the controversies surrounding Salman Rushdie\u2019s Satanic Verses. The obsession with a gendered depiction of Islam is then examined through an anthropological framework that sheds light on the problems of salvation narratives (Abu Lughod).

        "course_description": "\nIn the past ten years the authoritarian regime in Russia has rendered political protest exceedingly dangerous but it has not immobilized the cultural forms of dissent shaping contemporary anti-war resistance. From a feminist performance in a church to satirical documentary and whimsical trial speeches, contemporary artists, journalists, and activists have been creating the language of protest essential to understanding post-Soviet space. Why has protest in the post-Soviet region been taking these specific aesthetic forms? Taking our point of departure from Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s idea of resistance \u2013 signifying both firm persistence and a practice yielding change \u2013 we will explore how contemporary post-Soviet protest genres rely on the communication strategies that return to Soviet parody, poetic form, underground art, and dissident practices of cultural distribution. Looking at laughter as a transgressive communicative device, we will search for the reverberations of Soviet satire in Russian and Belorussian stand-up, as well as in less obvious genres, such as the recent documentary work by Alexey Navalny. We will focus on mimesis as a tool of resistance in Soviet underground art and contemporary performative practices. Exploring the aesthetics of testimony rooted in Soviet show trials, we will examine how Soviet journalistic prose and, later, contemporary theater reclaimed its devices. We will study the persistence of bodily tropes and language of violence in women\u2019s prose, drama, contemporary feminist poetry and feminist performance from Russia and Belarus. Finally, we will discuss how dissident practices of samizdat and tamizdat helped create cultural networks in Soviet Russia and beyond as we reflect on the use of new media platforms and technologies of digital activism in post-Soviet space. Rather than searching for instances of direct influence between cultural producers, we will examine how protest strategies are shaped and remediated while activating multiple layers of cultural memory. Students will learn to annotate images and videos online, write blog posts and carry out an independent research project in consultation with the instructor.

After World War II, the Marshall Islands became a US territory, as specified by a UN treaty, and the US immediately initiated a testing program to be conducted in the northern expanse of the islands. The testing was done in an overtly public manner and driven at the time by a Cold War mentality. As a result of the testing, the Marshallese people were both driven away from their homes and lands and exposed to radioactive fallout. A classified human subject health monitoring program was implemented under the name Project 4.1. From these tests, the US government was able to study the effects of nuclear fallout and the correlation to cancer rates in the Marshallese population, exposed at different distances from the test sites and over a time period of decades. This course is about the violent intersection of science and culture. Students will investigate the Marshallese culture prior to the nuclear weapons testing program and then study the ways in which the culture and people were affected by the program. They will also consider the challenges the Marshallese face today. The course will end on a series of group research projects to compare and contrast the Marshall Islands case with those of other indigenous populations affected by nuclear testing performed by other nuclear weapons states.

        "course_description": "\nAiming to improve human conditions within many diverse environments, sustainable development seeks to create, increase and perpetuate benefit and to cease, rectify and reverse harm. Sustainable development is consequently inextricable from the fabric of ethics, woven with determinations of benefit and harm to the existence and well-being of both humans and nonhumans. Underlying such determinations are those of self- and other-regarding motivation and behavior; and underlying these are still others, of sensitivity and rationality in decision-making, whether individual, social or public. Sustainable development is interlaced with and contingent upon all these determinations, at once prescriptive and judgmental, which can be called the ethics of sustainable development. This course is divided into four main sections, of which two are intended to show the ethical fallacies of unsustainable development, and two, the ethical pathways of sustainable development. The first section focuses upon ethically problematic basic assumptions, including human (species) hegemony, happy (hedonic) materialism, and selective (data) denial. The second focuses upon ethically problematic ensuing rationalizations, including those pertaining to damages, victims, consequences and situations of climatic, chemical, biological and ecological harm. The third section responds to these rationalizations with ethically vital considerations of earth justice, environmental justice, culturally-based ethics, and sector-based ethics (water, food, place and climate ethics). Finally, the fourth section responds to the initial, longstanding problematic assumptions with a newly emergent ethical paradigm, comprising biotic wholeness, environmental integrity and the deliberative zero-goal. Tying all sections together is the central theme: to be sustainable, development must be ethical. Reflecting the collaborative quality of the field of sustainable development, the course extends to readings whose authors have all pursued their work at intersections of science and ethics, environment and ethics, policy and ethics, business and ethics, and sustainable development and ethics",

Human welfare status is very unevenly distributed throughout the globe - some of us live very comfortable lives, others remain in desperate poverty showing little progress away from their condition. Between are countries that are rapidly developing and converging toward the welfare of the richest. At all levels of economic development human activities place significant pressure on the environment and threatens all of Earth\u2019s vital functions and support systems for human life. This challenge requires timely responses based on solid understanding of the human/environment interface, technological and economic approaches to mitigate adverse effects on the environment, and routes to understanding the complex dynamics of the coupled human/natural systems that can chart a pathway to improvement in the lives of the poorest and continued well-being for those who have achieved prosperity without forcing natural systems into decline or massive fluctuation. This course offers undergraduate students, for the first time, a comprehensive course on the link between natural disaster events and human development at all levels of welfare. It explores the role that natural disasters might have and have had in modulating development prospects. Any student seriously interested in sustainable development, especially in light of climate change, must study the nature of extreme events - their causes, global distribution and likelihood of future change. This course will cover not only the nature of extreme events, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and droughts but also their transformation into disaster through social processes. It will ultimately help students to understand the link between such extreme events, the economic/social shock they represent and development outcomes. The course will combine careful analysis of the natural and social systems dynamics that give rise to disasters and examine through group learning case studies from the many disasters that have occurred in the first decade of the 21st century.

Essential Connections begins by examining the development of America\u2019s water and energy policies over the past century and how such policies helped to shape present-day environmental law and regulation. Our focus then turns to the current state of US water and energy resources and policy, covering issues such as oil and gas exploration, nuclear energy, hydroelectric power and renewables.

Students will analyze written texts, but they will also be challenged to read and interpret a piece of the landscape, an object, or ecosystem through their immersive experience on Cuttyhunk Island. Readings will investigate the natural and human histories of the Buzzards Bay region, contemporary sustainability efforts on Cuttyhunk, as well as the wider assumptions and categories that shape the ideas of sustainability and habitability: what models of action and agency are entailed in these concepts? What relationships between humans and non-human (beings and environments) do such concepts presuppose? Finally, what skills, structures, and actions are necessary to make places habitable, and inhabit them well?",

The class will learn how New York City and a coalition of upstate watershed communities worked to end nearly a century of mutual resentment, displacement and extraction by entering into the Watershed Agreement of 1997, which has become a widely renowned model for collaborative and equitable water resources management planning in the twenty-five years since its completion. Students will engage with several of the Watershed Agreement\u2019s original negotiators and with the local elected officials, agency staff and non-profit leaders who implement its signature \u201cmulti-barrier\u201d strategy for drinking water protection through open space preservation, support for sustainable farming practices and investments in clean water infrastructure and sustainable economic growth in watershed communities. They will also learn how increases in storm intensity and warming driven by climate change threaten to upset the delicate balance between New York City\u2019s need for safe drinking water and the socio-economic interests of upstate watershed communities.

        "course_description": "\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has made the underlying health disparities that exist in the United States more apparent. The traditional biomedical model places the responsibility of these disparities on the choices that an individual makes. The model assumes that one\u2019s smoking, eating and exercising habits are based on personal choice. Therefore, the prevalence of morbidities such as high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes is the result of an individual\u2019s poor decisions. This course will explore how the conditions under which individuals live, work, play and pray impact their health outcomes. Collectively these conditions are referred to as the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) and often they reveal the systemic inequalities that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. This course will also call upon the need for a paradigm shift from the \u201cSocial\u201d Determinants of Health to the \u201cStructural\u201d Determinants of Health. This shift is in recognition that it is the underlying structures (laws, material infrastructure) that impact health outcomes. The development of the SDoH has challenged health care providers to look beyond the biomedical model that stresses an individual\u2019s behavior as the main predictor of adverse health conditions. Instead the SDoH focuses on an \u201cupstream\u201d approach that examines the underlying systemic and racial inequalities that impact communities of color and their health outcomes. An analysis that focuses upstream reveals that government policies and social structure are at the core of health disparities. Through the lens of New York City and its health systems, this course will cover a wide range of topics related to race and health, including: racial inequalities in housing and homelessness, biases in medical institutions, and the unconscious bias that lead providers to have racialized perception of an individual\u2019s pain tolerance. In addition to exposing these inequalities the course will also provide innovative solutions that seek to mitigate these barriers including: home visiting programs, medical respite programs for homeless patients and food as medicine in health care systems. Students will demonstrate their knowledge through individual writing, and class discussion. The course revolves around important readings, lectures, and podcasts that illustrates how one\u2019s class position and the color of one\u2019s skin can influence the access to healthcare one has as well as their experience of it",

Through reading, discussion, and critical analysis, the overarching goal is to help students learn to think about gender \u2013 and, by extension, about any form of social stratification \u2013 in relation to the health of populations, as opposed to individuals.We also examine how public health as a field is itself a domain in which gender is reproduced or contested. Given the enormous range of outcomes and disparities on which such a class might focus, it is impossible to examine every possible gendered pattern of population health. We will focus on four (sometimes overlapping) broad areas of work in public health: child survival, sexual and reproductive health, violence, and substance use.

The ideal screams of opportunity and meritocracy: no matter how poor one begins life, as long as they work and save, they can enjoy the security and safety of home. To many, this ideal gives them hope, for they can see possibility for their achievement. To others, the ideal feels like a farce, for they rightly anticipate facing countless barriers to achieving that dream. This course examines challenges, contradictions, and ironies of American housing equity. We study ways in which the ideal of single-family home ownership has directly led to excluding large portions of the population from secure housing. We examine why and how many Americans can be deeply committed to equality and freedom and still perpetuate inequalities in their housing choices. We examine how people at the bottom who understand well the barriers they face still manage to survive, invent, and struggle to achieve dignity and equity in their housing. The course examines core issues of housing equity in America historically and in the present. The course primarily offers a sociological perspective on housing. But we will also read work and bring in perspectives from geography, history, urban planners, and others. In addition, we will also engage with work by journalists, which represents one way that the multi-disciplinary issues of housing are connected in narratives intended for a wider audience than more scholarly products.

Building\non the work of Marxist criminologists like Rusche and Kirchheimer, we explore the\nrelationship between the U.S. criminal justice system and the market. To what extent can we\nunderstand the penal field as autonomous from economic relationships? To what extent do\neconomic forces or logics determine criminological thinking and practice? Building on\nDurkheim, we explore how punishment is both reflective of social values and constitutive of\nsocial solidarity, and investigate the symbolic consequences (intended and unintended) of\ncontemporary punishment regimes. Building on readings from Foucault, we explore\npunishment and its relationship to the emergence of new forms of bureaucratic and\ndisciplinary power. Finally, with Goffman, we explore the interactive context of the prison\nas relatively autonomous from the external forces that bring it into being.\nWith the classical theorists behind us, we turn to a history of the present. What is the age at\nwhich we are living today? What are the economic, political, and symbolic causes and\nconsequences of mass incarceration? To what extent can we understand mass incarceration,\nand more recent reform efforts, as reflective or constitutive of new forms of power in\ncontemporary society?\nFinally, we conclude by asking what the future might hold. After four decades of explosive\ngrowth, the U.S. incarceration rate has been declining slowly for the last several years. Crime\nrates have declined steadily for the last quarter century. At the same time, Black Lives\nMatter has put renewed focus on the ways in which the state continues to exert violence in\npoor communities of color.

The second part of the seminar focuses on Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank (and Gaza) and the settlement project, as well as on USA's role and its impact on the conflict, the occupation, and Israel. These topics did not get much academic attention until recently, but as researchers began to realize that the Occupation and the West Bank settlements are among the most permanent institutions in Israel, they have come under the scrutiny of academic research. The third part the seminar will concentrate on the development of the conflict after the establishment of Israel and its effects on sociological processes and institutions in contemporary Israel. Analyzing patterns of continuity and change in the past seven decades, we will discuss immigration and emigration patterns, as well as issue relating to ethnicity, gender, religion and politics, and the Israeli military",

The readings and practical exercises we will do together are designed to expand your technical skillset, inspire your thinking, to show you the importance of working collaboratively with intellectual peers, and to give you experiential knowledge of various kinds of fieldwork. Mostly, though, students will learn how to conduct indictive field-based analyses. There are many versions of this model, including Florian Znaniecki\u2019s \u201canalytic induction,\u201d Barney Glaser and Anselm Straus\u2019 \u201cgrounded theory,\u201d John Stuart Mill\u2019s system of inductive logic, the Bayesian approach to inference in statistics, and much of what computationally-intensive researchers refer to as data mining. This course will expose students to ways of thinking about their research shared by many of these different inductive perspectives. Remember, though, that all of these formulations of analytic work are ideal types. The actual field, and actual field workers, are often far more complex. For that reason, this course focuses not merely on theory, but also, and fundamentally, on practice. While some skills like producing a code book or formulating a hypothesis can be developed through reading and reflection, the field demands more nuanced skillsets that can only be attained by trial and error. How do you get an honest answer to a painful or embarrassing question? How do we know that the researcher interviewed enough people? Or spent enough time in the field? Or asked the right questions? Or did not distort the truth? My hope is that by the end of class you will have done enough fieldwork to have arrived at a good set of answers, and to begin developing the ability to communicate your answers to others. A note on intellectual parentage: The particular approach to training in this course is based on a qualitative bootcamp developed by Mario Small for Harvard\u2019s Ph.d cohorts. Other methods courses focus on particular technical skills rather than analytic frames, or merely on empirical work itself, rather than secondary literature on method. This is one way to think through analytic training. We will try it out together",

        "course_description": "\nFrom the beginning of the XXth Century some of the key figures of Spanish contemporary culture, writers, filmmakers or architects, had a very close relationship to New York, sometimes as travelers, sometimes living in the city for long periods of time. That transatlantic contact, far from anecdotal, turned into an essential element of the self-understanding of those authors and a crucial presence in their work. The contact with New York modernity would be an unavoidable component in their own versions of modernity but their presence would also leave an important trace in the city. As yet more Spanish cultural travelers got in contact with the city a different phenomenon developed: from the 1950\u2019s, New York would be used as a privileged stage to project a certain institutional idea of Spain, to sell a refurbished image of the nation as sophisticated and modern after decades of international marginalization under Francoism. This course will develop a comparative study of both processes as seen in literary sources, film and architecture (Garc\u00eda Lorca, Camba, Dal\u00ed, T\u00e1pies, Bu\u00f1uel, Loriga, Sert, Calatrava\u2026)",

They were sent and offered as proof of the new territories, desired and collected. The powerful subtlety of unexpected artistic forms, media, and monuments triggered a new space of inquiry. Novel materials, techniques, and ideas about artistry were observed far and near\u2014in the Americas, in Asia, in Africa, and in Europe. They were also described, compared and analyzed in letters, histories, or inventories. All around a sphere that could now be mentally embraced, missionaries, collectors, historians, and artists felt under the power of novel creations: intricate shell jewelries, wood and stone sculptures, turquoise masks, feather mosaics, painted manuscripts and folding screens, ivory spoons, carved temples, monumental cities, and so on. These splendid artworks deeply challenged conceptual boundaries such as those between: idol and image, beautiful and frightening, civilized and barbarian, center and periphery, classic and modern, and ancient and new. The artworks and their descriptions contributed to define humanity as immanently creative and to conceive artistic creation as a distinctive form of thought.

        "course_description": "\nPrerequisites: Knowledge of written and spoken Spanish. \nFounded to combat Christian heresy in the late fifteenth century but based on previous medieval models, the Spanish Inquisition is notorious as an institution of religious persecution. Converts from Judaism and Islam to Christianity, not to mention a host of other minority Christian communities, often fell under inquisitorial suspicion. The interrogation and censorship tactics employed by inquisitors and their agents to police these communities sometimes but not always entailed violence. Punishments for those convicted of infractions similarly ranged widely, from the notorious auto-de-f\u00e9 to more minor acts of contrition. In this course, we will study these inquisitorial procedures and their underlying theological presuppositions. We also will examine how the \u201cHoly Office,\u201d as it the inquisition was likewise known, fit into the broader religious and political cultures of the Iberian world during the sixteenth century. That is, both Catholic and Protestant reformers of the period often emphasized inquisitorial violence in order to smear their adversaries or make Spain seem backward, while some apologists for Spanish empire and orthodoxy insisted upon the noble intentions driving inquisition These early modern tensions have shaped our late modern understanding of inquisition history. Over the course of the semester we will aim to test these \u201cblack\u201d and \u201cwhite\u201d legends of Spanish inquisitorial and imperial violence not only against a range of primary sources and archival documents from the sixteenth century, but also against our own presuppositions about tolerance and intolerance, religious freedom, and the relationship between religion and secularism in the present. Readings include inquisitorial case archives, polemical and pedagogical works by Nicolas Eimeric, Hernando de Talavera, Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada, and other early inquisitors and their critics, and articles and book chapters by modern scholars such as Christine Caldwell Ames, Wendy Brown, Michel Foucault, Carlo Ginzburg, Henry Kamen, Doris Moreno, and others.",

        "course_description": "\nIn 1918, German sociologist Max Weber lamented that scientific innovation had made the world too transparent\u2013\u2013disenchanted, devoid of magic. However, even in current times, characterized by information on demand, ubiquitous connectedness, and hyper-rationalization, magic and belief in the supernatural continue to operate and fascinate in the Western world. Think, for instance, of TikTok \u201cghost cams,\u201d or the incorporation of terms like manifesting or ritual into popular discourses of personal success and self-care. At the same time, we may argue that enchantment never disappeared in many parts of the world: consider the reclamation of the term \u201cbrujx\u201d to designate a syncretic spirituality connected with queerness and Latinx ethnicity. In response to these trends and the normalization of magical language in the mainstream, this seminar proposes an expansive an intersectional investigation of what \u201cmagic\u201d has meant in the Hispanic world: organized in a loosely chronological manner, it delves into the conceptual roots and historical relevance of notions of magic and supernatural in the Greater Caribbean (Haiti, Cuba, Venezuela, Colombia), Spain, Guatemala, Argentina, Bolivia, and Mexico and its US border. With a combination of written, cinematic, pictorial, and audio primary and secondary texts, the seminar addresses the political implications of magical belief and practices; the affects and relationships that magic metaphorizes in literature; the role of belief in configuring socioeconomic hierarchies in colonial and postcolonial contexts; and the uses of popular spirituality to assert agency against the forces of colonialism, capitalism, and patriarchy",

The field of Speculative Fiction uses multiple forms of arts and media to craft fictional imaginaries that have become a vehicle to narrate historical horrors (Merla-Watson \uff06 Olgui\u0301n) and criticize versions of modernity imposed across the Americas (Colanzi). Nonetheless, as Gaspar de Alba claims, these artifacts remain both alien and Indigenous to the West. While these speculative imaginaries use the codes of non-mimetic fiction, such as space-time travel, creatures, robots, alternative realities, and genetics; they also expand upon them to address struggles of the Americas\u2019 history of colonialism, dispossession, and mestizaje. Throughout the seminar, we will engage in a cross-cultural trajectory of multiple forms of representation, such as literature, comics, film, music, and performance within the US-Mexico border, the Caribbean, and the Southern Cone. From Anzaldu\u0301a\u2019s Borderlands to Queer Futurities. We will navigate movies like La Llorona and Sleep Dealer, and representations in Marvel, DC, and Star Wars universes. From transdisciplinary works by Rita Indiana and Luis Carlos Barraga\u0301n to artwork by Marion Mati\u0301nez, Amalia Ortiz, and Mati\u0301as Bergara.

It will include an introduction to original performance practices in ancient Greece (space, masking, choral performance, costume, acting techniques) and an examination of how artists from different contemporary theatrical traditions have adapted ancient texts in modern performances and new versions of the plays. The bulk of the course will be focused on the problems of acting, interpreting, and reinterpreting parts of three plays on the stage, Sophocles\u2019 Antigone, Euripides\u2019 Medea, and Sophocles\u2019 Ajax along with a new version by Ellen McLaughlin, who teaches playwriting at Barnard, Ajax in Iraq. Students will view all or parts of particularly interesting recent productions from various theatrical traditions, which will help them to tackle challenging issues such as choral performance and choral rhythms, masking, character work, dialogues and presenting formal political debates. For contemporary actors training in Greek tragedy offers a unique opportunity to improve their performance on stage through ensemble work and representing character through speech. It enhances dramaturgical capacities that a contemporary theater practitioner must exercise in exploring theory in practice and vice versa. This class is directed to students particularly interested in dramaturgy, directing, designing, translation, and Greek tragedy as well as acting",

It presents theatre as a distinctively theoretical and material activity, one in which the stage practices of training and performance are understood to articulate theoretical and ideological attitudes about the world, and in which theoretical texts are understood to summon modes of theatrical being into presence. In the course, students will undertake four distinctive activities: they will read plays; they will read theoretical texts, often having to do with performance; they will make several brief experimental critical performances; and they will write about performance as a mode of theoretical critique. The course is broken up into four main units, each of which opens with a critical response to a problem in the history of performance\u2014the impact of realism, or of politics as theatre, for example\u2014followed by a studio class, in which students experiment with the interaction between performance and conceptualization, and then returns to the seminar room for an accounting of how, how well, or whether this interaction was materialized. Plays have been selected in order to bring critical issues directly into focus. All students will participate in 4 experimental critical performances; write briefly about them, and undertake both a final performance and a longer critical essay analyzing the challenging interface between theoretical critique and critical performance.

The course will focus on key concepts in planning history, theory, and practice, including the various conflicts and dilemmas planners face, stakeholders involved in urban planning, and the tools and methods that planners use to address challenges in the built environment. The core questions that this class will return to throughout the semester are: How does planning take place, and whose interest(s) does planning serve? How does planning (re)produce social inequities? Planning is often framed as a technical exercise to rationalize the built environment and create more \u201clivable\u201d cities. However, planning is not value-neutral. As we will examine throughout the course of the semester, power relations fundamentally shape the planning profession, and planning decisions have contributed to racial, economic, and gender inequalities and spatial segregation in cities throughout the United States. We will also explore debates about how to encourage more inclusive cities and engage in more ethical planning practice. The course is divided into six sections. In Part I, we will explore foundational concepts in urban planning, such as how previous scholars have defined urban planning and urban space. In Part II, we will explore the historical context in which the planning profession emerged and key moments in planning history. In Part III, we will examine normative models of planning, or how the planning profession conceives of itself. In Part IV, we will learn about the different technical tools that planners use to regulate urban development and key debates surrounding these tools. In Part V, we will interrogate the role of the planner, the role of power relations in planning, and how planning decisions have resulted in racial, class, and gender exclusion in the built environment. In Part VI, we will contemplate future directions in planning",

How are these spaces embedded in surrounding urban communities\u2014and what sociospatial and political conflicts do they engender among community members? How do different forms of heritage articulate with broader urban processes such as gentrification and re-development? To tackle these questions, this course takes a global and interdisciplinary approach, drawing on sources from history, memory and museum studies, anthropology, geography, archaeology, architecture, and urban planning.

Through both our readings and our field exercises, we will focus on the methods at the heart of ethnography: observation and participant-observation. As we read other scholars\u2019 work, we will ask how the author uses ethnographic tools to explore issues that are suitable for intensive fieldwork. We will assess which kinds of research problems and theoretical perspectives are a good fit with ethnography and the roles that ethnography can play in transdisciplinary research projects. You will apply what you have learned about research to design your own pilot fieldwork. The ethnographies that we read together will examine intersections of housing, race, and class in urban communities.

In this class, we will use public schools as an example to examine the role race plays in shaping urban spaces and institutions. We will begin by unpacking the concept of racialization, or the process by which a person, place, phenomenon, or characteristic becomes associated with a certain race. Then, we will explore the following questions: What are the connections between city schools and their local contexts? What does it mean to be a \u201cneighborhood school\u201d? How do changes in neighborhoods change schools? We will use ethnographies, narrative non-fiction, and educational research to explore these questions from a variety of perspectives.

        "course_description": "\nNew York City is made up of more than 400 neighborhoods. The concept of neighborhoods in cities has had many meanings and understandings over time. Equally complex is the concept of community used to describe the people attached to or defined by neighborhood. While neighborhood can be interpreted as a spatial, social, political, racial, ethnic, or even, economic unit; community often refers to the group of stakeholders (i.e. residents, workers, investors) whose interests directly align with the conditions of their environment. Community development is \u201ca process where these community members come together to take collective action and generate solutions to common problems\u201d that result from the changing contexts in their neighborhoods. Using a variety of theories and approaches, residents organize themselves or work with community development practitioners on the ground to obtain safe, affordable housing, improve the public realm, build wealth, get heard politically, develop human capital, and connect to metropolitan labor and housing markets. To address the ever-changing contexts of neighborhoods, community development organizations are taking on new roles and adapting (in various cases) to larger forces within the city, region and nation such as disinvestment, reinvestment, increased cultural diversity, an uncertain macroeconomic environment, and changes in federal policy. For more than a century, city-dwellers\u2014and especially New Yorkers\u2014have been tackling these challenges. This course will examine both historic and contemporary community building and development efforts, paying special attention to approaches which were shaped by New York City. This urban center, often described as a \u201ccity of neighborhoods,\u201d has long been a seedbed for community-based problem-solving inventions.

        "course_description": "\nHow should we define housing? As a concept, housing is both simple and complex. As a physical concept, housing provides shelter, and it is durable and visible. Yet, housing is more than just its physical components. As a social concept, housing is a clear insignia of social status and can be an investment vehicle to accumulate and hoard wealth. Additionally, housing (and housing policy) both amplifies and reinforces larger patterns of racial and economic bias witnessed in wider society. This course examines the institutional, economic, regulatory, and political factors that affect the production, subsidization, and siting of housing in the United States. We will trace the varied policy approaches that local, state, and federal governments have leveraged to deliver affordable housing over time. Throughout the course, we will pay particular attention to how U.S. housing policy historically is built on a segregationist ideology, often linking the presence of non-white and low-income households with neighborhood instability and as a threat to stable property values. We will also explore the various approaches that the public sector has pursued to attempt to undo the racially segregated housing market of its own making. The course is divided into three sections. Part I reviews how previous scholars have defined housing, provides a brief introduction to housing policy history, and introduces the basics of supply and demand in housing markets and housing finance. Part II examines various approaches to provide affordable housing at the federal, state, and local level and how these approaches have evolved over time. Part III examines contemporary housing policy debates. Since this class is an upper-level seminar, students should expect to read about 150 pages of reading per week and to listen to a podcast or watch a select movie on specific weeks. Students will be expected to complete all of the assigned readings before class. Class time primarily will be devoted to class discussions, so students should plan to formulate thoughts about the readings before class and to participate actively in class discussions each week",

Students will learn construction techniques, glazing and finishing methods, and particulars about firing procedures. This part of the course will move quickly in order to expose the students to a variety of ceramic processes. Weekly assignments, demonstrations, and lectures will be given. The second centers on the issue of how to integrate ceramics into the students current practice. Asking the question of why we use ceramics as a material and, further, why we choose the materials we do to make art. Rigorous group and individual critiques focusing on the above questions will be held. The goal of this course is to supply the students with the knowledge and skill necessary to work in ceramics and enough proficiency and understanding of the material to enable them to successfully incorporate it into their practice.

There is a focus on precision and gaining a thorough understanding of the interaction between light and a surface. This approach emphasizes drawing by understanding the subject and the physical world that defines it.

The focus will be on artworks that reference the body/bodies in movement, the creation of Avatars and the designing of environments and spatial narratives. Existing works from this emergent area will be shown to give cultural and historical context, seen through a personal and political lens. The course will be intensive and hands-on, the apprehension of technical and aesthetic skills will be utilized to create works based on the individual or collective expression of the artist/s. Students are encouraged to explore areas of personal interest and to incorporate this research into their production work. Taking an active role in class discussions and production teamwork is required. The course is offered to both graduate and undergraduate students. It is expected that at the end of the course students will have gained an active knowledge of core concepts and techniques useful in working with performance capture within an art context",

Students will engage with a variety of aesthetic strategies and formal techniques such as movement workshops, sensory exercises, video, wearable sculptures, collaboration, scores, and group meditation. Studio work will focus on concrete intersections between the body and the object, and case studies chosen to encourage students to think of movement as a form of resistance, and to consider the political implication of collaborative work that unfolds over time.

We will reflect on the tension between the limits of what we can know about ourselves and others and the imperative to care for each other and remain accountable for our individual and collective actions and inaction. We will investigate how our deepest emotions, intimate encounters, and secret fantasies are formed by larger social and political contexts.

If it is a small world after all, how do forces of globalization shape and redefine the relationship between gender, sexuality, and powerful institutions like the state?

As these examples indicate, gender has played a significant role in Yiddish literary power dynamics. This course will explore representation of gender and sexuality in modern Yiddish literature and film in works created by Sholem Aleichem, Sholem Asch, Fradl Shtok, Sh. An-sky, Malka Lee, Anna Margolin, Celia Dropkin, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Kadya Molodowsky, Troim Katz Handler, and Irena Klepfisz.

The short story has been seized upon and refreshed by diverse cultures and aesthetic affiliations, so that perhaps the only stable definition of the form remains the famous one advanced by Poe, one of its early masters, as a work of fiction that can be read in one sitting. Still, common elements of the form have emerged over the last century and this course will study them, including Point of View, Plot, Character, Setting and Theme. John Hawkes once famously called these last four elements the \"enemies of the novel,\" and many short story writers have seen them as hindrances as well. Hawkes later recanted, though some writers would still agree with his earlier assessment, and this course will examine the successful strategies of great writers across the spectrum of short story practice, from traditional approaches to more radical solutions, keeping in mind how one period's revolution -Hemingway, for example - becomes a later era's mainstream or \"commonsense\" storytelling mode. By reading the work of major writers from a writer's perspective, we will examine the myriad techniques employed for what is finally a common goal: to make readers feel. Short writing exercises will help us explore the exhilarating subtleties of these elements and how the effects created by their manipulation or even outright absence power our most compelling fictions",

The routes we chose for our writing lead to destinations of our own making, and we take them at our own risk\u2014necessarily so, as the pursuit of poetry asks each of us to light a pilgrim\u2019s candle and follow it into the moors and lowlands, through wastes and prairies, crossing waters as we go. Go after the marshlights, the will-o-wisps who call to you in a voice you\u2019ve longed for your whole life. These routes have been forged by those who came before you, but for that reason, none of them can hope to keep you on it entirely. You must take your steps away, brick by brick, heading confidently into the hinterland of your own distinct achievement. For the purpose of this class, we will walk these roads together, examining the works of classic and contemporary exemplars of the craft. By companioning poets from a large spread of time, we will be able to more diversely immerse ourselves in what a poetic \u201ctradition\u201d truly means. We will read works by Edmund Spencer, Dante, and Goethe, the Romantics\u2014especially Keats\u2014Dickinson, who is mother to us all, Modernists, and the great sweep of contemporary poetry that is too vast to individuate. While it is the imperative of this class to equip you with the knowledge necessary to advance in the field of poetry, this task shall be done in a Columbian manner. Consider this class an initiation, of sorts, into the vocabulary which distinguishes the writers who work under our flag, each of us bound by this language that must be passed on, and therefore changed, to you who inherit it.

The larger question the class seeks to answer, both on a collective and individual level, is: How can we craft a working definition of those elements endemic to short prose as a genre?

Our reading chart the course from the genres emergence, examining the prose poem in 19th-century France through the works of Mallarme, Baudelaire, Max Jacob and Rimbaud. Well examine aspects of poetry -- the attention to the lyrical, the use of compression, musicality, sonic resonances and wit -- and attempt to understand how these writers took, as Russell Edson describes, experience [and] made it into an artifact with the logic of a dream.

Discussions around body politics, race, gender, ability, illness, death, metamorphosis, monstrosity and pleasure will be parallel to the consideration of how a text might function itself as a body in space and time. We will consider such questions as: What is the connective tissue of a story or a poem? What is the nervous system of a lyric essay? How is formal constraint similar to societal ideals about beauty and acceptability of certain bodies? How do words and language function at the cellular level to build the body of a text? How can we make room to honor, in our writing, bodies that have otherwise been marginalized? We will also consider non-human bodies (animals \uff06 organisms) and embodiments of the supernatural (ghosts, gods \uff06 specters) in our inquiries.

An aesthetic experience might be best initially defined as a subjective and often profound encounter with an object, artwork, or phenomenon that elicits a heightened sense of beauty, appreciation, or emotional response. It involves a deep engagement with the sensory, emotional, and intellectual aspects of the object of appreciation. Aesthetic experiences typically involve a sense of pleasure, contemplation, or emotional resonance, and they often transcend practical or utilitarian considerations. These experiences can encompass a wide range of phenomena, literature, natural landscapes, and even everyday objects when perceived with a heightened sense of awareness and appreciation. Aesthetic experiences are highly personal and can vary from person to person based on individual preferences, cultural backgrounds, and emotional responses. For me, an aesthetic experience is both mysterious and confounding\u2014I\u2019m impacted physically as much as it might mentally or emotionally. In the throes of an aesthetic experience, I might feel the small hairs on my arms or on the back of my neck stand up. I might feel nearly ill from a racing heart or my stomach turning. I might feel energized by new thoughts prompted by the experience or feel my heart swell in appreciation and awe. I might also feel a deep sense of recognition\u2014one that connects me to the art object and its maker in a way that transcends time and place. But why do I feel this? Where does this feeling come from? What is really happening?? In this class, we\u2019ll study this question on two levels: 1. A \u2018theoretical\u2019 level. Theorists, critics, and philosophers have long tried to understand what it means to have an aesthetic experience. Plato likened this experience to madness, Kant to the sublime; Tolstoy argued the aesthetic experience was a form of communication only accessible through engagement in art. Historians place aesthetic experience within the context of time and culture. We\u2019ll study and discuss theories that have tried to define this mysterious phenomenon. 2. A \u2018practical\u2019 level. We\u2019ll also read the work of writers who have puzzled through this question of the aesthetic experience by writing about their connection to a work or body of work by another artist. Often this involves a search to understand the self via the work of another artist.

In this seminar we will examine contemporary novels and short stories by immigrants and kids of immigrants that resist cliched diaspora narratives. Starting with the old guard that first defined immigrant writing, including Vladimir Nabokov and Sandra Cisneros, we\u2019ll dig into how this genre has evolved in the 21st century first with Julie Otsuka and Jhumpa Lahiri, and, more recently, with Jenny Zhang, Jade Sharma, and Anthony Veasna So. Duty, guilt, grandmas, food, debt, intergenerational trauma and buried family secrets that rise from the dead will be ever-present, of course, but we\u2019ll also find joy, absurdity, blasphemy, and other surprises as we study the distinct ways these authors reframe the immigrant experience and move beyond the lens of identity politics. Though our primary focus will be coming-of-age narratives, we\u2019ll read numerous works from adult perspectives, too, grappling especially with the concept \u201canagnorisis\u201d (Greek: \u201crecognition\u201d), which, in literary works, is a character\u2019s often startling discovery of their true identity. Throughout the course we\u2019ll use what we learn to produce new creative work biweekly, all while envisioning and executing ways to ultimately recast the \u201cother\u201d in our own fiction",

        "course_description": "\nAs 20th century literary traditions prove increasingly ill-equipped to capture the realities of 21st century life, readers look towards fictional worlds for inspiration and escape from the political chaos of day-to-day existence. When we write we shape the world, because the worlds we imagine impact the world we inhabit. But what does it mean for a writer to 'build a world?' What obligations does the creator of a fiction have to readers who inhabit a world they wish to escape? Are the worlds we build for escape always political? Can we build another world as an avenue to better understand this one? In this seminar we will explore the concept of \"world building\" by looking at a variety of work from authors who are known for their immense secondary worlds (such as J.R.R. Tolkein, Ursula K. Le Guin, N.K. Jemisin, or Octavia Butler) but also at fiction that applies techniques of both immersion and politics in ways that may subvert our understanding of what it means to 'create.' Writers discussed are as wide ranging as Toni Morrison, Angela Carter, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Margaret Atwood, Shirley Jackson, Ray Bradbury, Clive Barker, all the way up to contemporary writers whose works populate our best loved Independent bookstores: Helen Oyeyemi, Victor LaValle, Ted Chiang, Marlon James, Jeff VanderMeer, Colson Whitehead, Salman Rushdie, Carmen Maria Machado, Alexandra Kleeman, or Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah",

We will also confront some of the emotional challenges associated with doing work on the environment, especially in these particularly dynamic times. Over the course of the semester, students will create a research portfolio for creative work on a climate-related topic and practice integrating climate-related issues into works that are not explicitly climate focused. One key theme we will explore in concert with climate issues is the concept of time and how it should be framed in our narratives. Time factors into how we recognize the present era, and it also informs our sense of urgency where there is crisis. As the climate crisis continues to unfold, we face new conflicts with time: ice is melting faster than expected, sea levels rising faster than expected, fires happening more frequently than expected, marine level die-offs happening faster than expected, etc. The urgency with which the facts are now being revealed keeps changing the timelines we must confront, and yet, if we do not understand time\u2014beyond our biological relationship to it\u2014we may miss the opportunity to engage in meaningful work. By studying texts engaged in observational practice in the fields of geology, botany, geography, climate studies, animal studies and anthropology alongside literary works, we will forge a creative practice that integrates current research with established arguments and/or new narratives. The final work is a creative writing project based on this research. All literary genres welcome.

Using games, new media, and music, we will learn how to speak, read, listen and write in a language that is considered one of the richest languages in the world (in some aspects of vocabulary). We will also venture outside the classroom to explore the Yiddish world today: through field trips to Yiddish theater, Yiddish-speaking neighborhoods, Yiddish organizations, such as YIVO or Yiddish farm, and so on. We will also have Yiddish-speaking guests and do a few digital projects. At the end of the two-semester course, you will be able to converse in Yiddish on a variety of everyday topics and read most Yiddish literary and non-literary texts. Welcome to Yiddishland!",

This year-long course is a continuation of Elementary Yiddish II. As part of the New Media in Jewish Studies Collaborative, this class will be using new media in order to explore and research the fabulous world of Yiddish literature, language, and culture, and to engage in project-oriented activities that will result in creating lasting multi-media online presentations. In addition to expanding the command of the language that has been spoken by the Ashkenazi Jews for more than a millennium, i.e. focusing on developing speaking, reading, writing and listening skills, and on the acquisition of more advanced grammatical concepts, students will also get some video and film editing training, and tutorials on archival research. The class will continue to read works of Yiddish literature in the original and will venture outside of the classroom to explore the Yiddish world today: through exciting field trips to Yiddish theater, Yiddish-speaking neighborhoods, YIVO, Yiddish Farm, and so on. And we will also have the Yiddish native-speaker guest series. Welcome back to Yiddishland!",
