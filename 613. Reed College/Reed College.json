During the final weeks of the semester we will read texts by Jorge Luis Borges and Paul Auster that exploit narrative conventions found in Don Quixote. We will end the semester with student presentations that focus on adaptations and appropriations of Don Quixote in modern narrative. Conducted in English.

        "course_description": "This course studies the relationship between visual art and literature in early modern Spain. In an epoch in which the production of images has attained unprecedented cultural importance, literature redefines its aesthetic agenda, both modeling itself after and rivaling visual art. Considering various plays, poems, and novellas alongside relevant paintings, emblems, architectural works, and sculptures, we reflect upon how the interactions among these different art forms serve to mobilize audience emotion and comment on gender and class tensions. Also discussed are mounting anxieties about the role of art in a society marked by political crisis. In particular, we think about how the celebration of iconocentric culture is undercut by critical views of images as dangerous vehicles of moral and sexual depravity. Authors and artists studied include Teresa of Avila, Cervantes, Zayas, Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, Guill\u00e9n de Castro, Vel\u00e1zquez, Titian, El Greco, and Rubens. Conducted in English."

This course reflects on the generation of mutually conflicting female subjects in a context obsessed with the fight against religious and cultural otherness: the sinning body prone to sexual temptation and demonic possession and the saintly body, exemplary imitator of Christ\u2019s suffering. Considering a varied corpus of Inquisition trials, spiritual autobiographies, wifely conduct manuals, mystical poetry, novellas, chronicles, paintings, and printed images from Spain and its American colonies, we think about the contradictions inherent in global Counter-Reformation gender politics and the myriad ways in which female writers and fictional personae co-opt or resist the stringent corporeal and mental discipline imposed on them. Students will, in addition, gain an understanding of the rich web of associations between religious confessional culture and emergent fictional genres. Authors studied include St. Teresa of Avila, Fray Luis de Le\u00f3n, Christopher Columbus, Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, Mar\u00eda de Zayas, St. Rose of Lima, Sor Mar\u00eda de Agreda, and Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz.

The course combines interdisciplinary theoretical perspectives with a focus on how the relation between humans, nonhumans, and the environment has been represented, questioned, and problematized in cultural productions from the Hispanic world.

This course examines Lorca\u2019s creative output, focusing mainly on his theater and poetry but also considering his visual art and work as director of La Barraca, a traveling theater company whose mission was to bring theater to rural areas. In our study of the author\u2019s work, from Andalusian \u201cfolklore\u201d poetry and early dramatic farces, to avant-garde works influenced by surrealism and cubism, to his trilogy of tragedies focusing on existential problems confronting women in rural Spain, we will examine how Lorca engages with artists like Salvador Dal\u00ed, film director Luis Bu\u00f1uel, composer Manuel de Falla, and the critical debates of the early twentieth century.

Also considered will be emerging critical studies that accentuate the historical and political relevance of Borges\u2019s oeuvre. Along with these lines of inquiry, a series of theoretical categories and themes that are key for the comprehension of Borges\u2019s writing will be discussed: avant-garde ultraism; criollismo; metaphor and metonymy; Argentinean tradition; reading, misreading, and translation; authorship and figures of the author; canon and literary genealogy; history, memory, and forgetting."

The move away from collective farming is credited with unleashing productivity forces well beyond initial expectations and paving the way for a continuing series of market-oriented reforms, first in the rural and later in the urban sector. What is less well known, however, is that China also experienced a short-lived farm production boost in an earlier era, shortly after formation of the People\u2019s Republic of China. In contrast to the decentralization moves in the 1980s, rather the 1950s was characterized by gradual introduction of collective resource ownership and management, ultimately leading to commune-style farming. We will draw from a variety of analytical sources to understand how China transformed itself twice, in opposite directions, exploring the impetuses behind these changes, their impacts, and their legacies."

This course will examine various novelistic responses to the sociopolitical changes in different parts of Africa during the late twentieth and the twenty-first century. In what ways did the novel become a catalyst for cultural transformation in postcolonial Africa? How did the novel become the privileged genre of decolonization? Starting with the critiques of colonialism in the early decolonial period, we will explore topics including narratives of modernity and tradition, the failures of the nation-state, critique of patriarchy and gender, migration, displacement, neocolonial formations, and the promises and pitfalls of globalization.

She was also a poet in her own right, serving as both literary subject and object, and the same was true of women at all levels of society. This course introduces students to the range of poetry written by and about women in early modern England. In particular, it examines the ways in which sixteenth- and seventeenth-century poets represented the relationship of English womanhood to the world that produced and surrounded it, at home and abroad. What can we learn from both idealized and realistic portrayals of early modern women?

We will be learning about the aesthetics of ethnic American poetry by reading it in the context of Western and non-Western poetic traditions. We will use the historical circumstances and theories of ethnicity to help us understand both the political and the aesthetic choices behind poetic allusions, language, genre, diction, rhythm, and figurative language. The poems we read are chosen from a variety of genres, authors, and historical periods. Our aim will be to understand how the various techniques and genres open to poets enable them to produce works of art which speak to us and push us to think.

In response British writers and artists produced some of the most powerful representations in English literary history of hopes for liberty and progress, and of pure transcendent joy, as well as some of its sharpest attacks on oppression and convention. This class will discuss poetry and prose from the period, showing the impact of the French Revolution on British intellectual and public life in the 1790s, as well as the agitation for political reform in the first decades of the nineteenth century. We will examine the formal and stylistic innovations of these writers and the relation of their works to the profound social changes they document, investigating their philosophical, aesthetic, and expanding colonial contexts. The goal is to construct an effective working definition of the term \u201cRomanticism\u201d that comes to grips with the achievement and diversity of this group of writers/artists, and to engage with the impact of their works on cultural life and critical debates over the last century. Primary texts will be drawn from William Blake, Edmund Burke, Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin, Charlotte Smith, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Mary Robinson, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John Keats. Class readings will also include recent critical studies of the history, political context, and aesthetic debates of this revolutionary era.

We will study how enslaved black women\u2019s labor, and free women\u2019s unpaid household work, sustained their families and shaped nineteenth-century capitalism. We will examine how gendered and racial conventions and familial obligations kept most female wage-earners in agriculture, domestic service, and sex-typed and segregated factory jobs. Educated single women trained for feminized professions (teaching, nursing, and clerical work) but were routinely fired if they married. While women\u2019s labor sustained families during the Depression and helped win World War II, government jobs programs and postwar entitlements mainly benefited heterosexual family men. Single workers, straight and queer, found new ways to make their livings. Married women with children remained in the paid workforce throughout the postwar period; their number steadily increased through the end of the century, yet they remained underpaid and concentrated in feminized jobs. While wage-earning mothers became the norm, the ideal and symbol of the male breadwinner persisted. Labor historians have covered all of these topics, and more-we shall do so as well."

Nevertheless, the British people to this day view their shattering wartime experience as one of the great unifying and refining experiences in their culture and their history. This course will look at literary works brought forth from the wartime experience of British civilians from 1939 to 1945 and its aftermath, paying particular attention to its expression through late literary modernism and its contextualization through the experience of war. In addition to brief critical and historical readings, we will look at fictions by authors such as Virginia Woolf, Elizabeth Bowen, Penelope Fitzgerald, Henry Green, Muriel Spark, and Graham Greene. We will also watch British commercial and propaganda films from the era by directors such as Humphrey Jennings, Alberto Cavalcanti, David Lean, and the team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, and we will read essays relevant to the period by Woolf, Bowen, George Orwell, and Mollie Panter-Downes."

We will read the novel both as a representation of the Yankee whaling industry and as a search for its broader moral, social, and spiritual meanings. Seeking \u201ca marine tint to the imagination,\u201d as Henry David Thoreau puts it, we will read lesser-known works of authors such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Frederick Douglass, Emily Dickinson, Elizabeth Stoddard, Walt Whitman, and Louisa May Alcott. Our final unit examines posthuman and interspecies frameworks in contemporary environmental activism, as advocates seek to expand definitions of legal personhood to extend rights to nonhuman entities. Topics include marine biology and animal studies, petrofiction and materialist ecocriticism, environmental justice and humanities."

This debate, however, goes back to the nineteenth century, with Frederick Douglass and Martin Delany taking opposing positions. Delany, despite having been admitted to Harvard Medical School in 1850 and kicked out after a month because white students protested, and having served as a major in the Civil War, believed, long before Marcus Garvey, that African Americans had no future in the United States and started a movement to emigrate to Africa. Douglass, in opposition, believed the only future was in the United States. We will read fiction and speeches by both men, including Delany\u2019s novel Blake; or the Huts of America (1862), written in response to Stowe\u2019s Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, which he believed portrayed slaves as too passive.

The concept of aesthetics is nothing if not fluid: it can relate to perception through the senses; the philosophy of beauty; the art (or science!) of what is pleasing; the study of good taste; the standards by which art is judged-the list goes on. We will embark on a transhistorical exploration of beauty and the senses in Western literature across multiple genres, beginning with Plato and moving through the ideas of beauty and the sublime in the medieval world, representation and the self in the Renaissance, taste, sentiment, and the senses in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, finally ending with the modern period and the turn toward self-conscious artistic creation. Likely texts include Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets and T.S.

We will devote some time to the forces that led to the creation of two states, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, a century ago in 1922; to the Troubles of the late 1960s to the late 1990s in Northern Ireland; and to the literary response to both events. We will focus on questions about the relationship between politics and language; the roles of myth, folklore, and religion; how Irish nationalism interacts with the discourses of gender, class, and race; and the complicated relationships of Irish exiles like James Joyce and Samuel Beckett with their homeland. Authors will include W.B. Yeats, Lady Gregory, J.M. Synge, James Joyce, Sean O\u2019Casey, Samuel Beckett, Seamus Heaney, Eavan Boland, and Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill."

        "course_description": "From hypertexts to video games to livestreams, the storytelling affordances of digital media have captivated creators for nearly half a century. While new media narratives have expressed the liberatory potentials of interactivity and connectivity in their works, they have also raised deep questions about human agency, responsibility, and identity within our increasingly technological world. How are users interpellated within constructs of race, gender, sexuality, and ability as they create an avatar or act within digital spaces? How does the ability to interface with creators or transform narrative outcomes alter one\u2019s relationship to any given story? What are the ethical dilemmas inherent in taking control of virtual bodies, especially those that differ from one\u2019s own? This course aims to allow students to explore these questions for themselves by analyzing a variety of new media texts and putting them in conversation with theories of technology and identity. Potential texts to be analyzed include literary hypertexts such as Shelley Jackson\u2019s Patchwork Girl, digital games such as the Fulbright Company\u2019s Gone Home, and digital-native visual media such as Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s Dirty Computer."

In this course, we will investigate adaptation as a product, process, and reception practice, drawing on theories and case studies that span literature, film, new media artifacts, and digital and analog games. Through discussion and analysis of literary adaptations of works by authors such as Shakespeare, Shelley, Austen, and more, we will seek to answer questions regarding fidelity to a \u201csource\u201d text, medium specificity, fan appropriation, and the limits of adaptation (among others). Note that this is a team-based learning course: in order to cover a wide range of adaptations, students will be divided into teams, each of which will be responsible for analyzing a particular film or new media work using theoretical course readings and integrating it into class discussion. Previous experience with film and new media analysis is recommended."

This course will focus on text-image relations in paper and print media, including illuminated texts, illustrated texts, collage, texts with photographs, paintings with captions, graphic novels, and fine art books. Our study will be guided by the following questions: How do text-image compositions deploy their media to enrich meaning-making potential while also engaging their dissonance or dissociation? How do text and image differently engage the senses, the intellect, and the emotions? How do words and images each convey symbolic or metaphoric content or use syntax and argument? How do text and image illuminate, distort, or amplify aspects of individual consciousness or historical narrative? Primary texts may include Haida tradition in Raven Steals the Light, Plains Indian ledger narratives, Christine de Pizan\u2019s Epistre D\u2019Oth\u00e9a, Gustave Dor\u00e9\u2019s and William Blake\u2019s illustrations of Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost, William Blake\u2019s Songs of Innocence and Experience, Jacob Lawrence\u2019s Migration Series, Max Ernst\u2019s The Hundred Headless Woman, Alison Bechdel\u2019s Fun Home, W.G.

        "course_description": "Social networks of all kinds, from the court of Louis XIV to nineteenth-century Paris, foster excitement, competition, glamour, and thrill, but also anxiety and isolation. These societies are built on an intense exchange of messages and information, often corrupted by lies, misinformation, and mutual manipulation. Exposed to compromises of privacy and security risks, what humans create is destroyed daily. Personal credit and reputation are constantly at stake and vulnerable in a market of appearances, which can make its members shine or perish. Among the influencers, sycophants, and fans, there are sociopaths, bullies, and trolls who use harm, humiliation, or ruin to satisfy their own pleasure or interest. We will explore how authors from the seventeenth century to the present examine these social dynamics through novels and plays by authors such as Madame de Lafayette, Laclos, Balzac, Camus, Sartre, and Genet in works such as La Princesse de Cl\u00e8ves, Le P\u00e8re Goriot, La Peste, or Les Bonnes. We will also ask how literary works contribute to the formation and dissemination of these networks through salons, reviews, and their own apparatus of distribution and reception.

Our exploration of the uncanny will entail delving into a range of literary genres and media from nineteenth-century Romanticism to Surrealism, including short stories, poetry, essays, photographs, and films as well as theoretical essays that attempt to define the uncanny and specify the uncanny nature of reproduction and representation.

What assumptions are expressed by poetic texts about the relationship between the human and the nonhuman, or the place of human beings in the world they inhabit? Can we imagine poetic texts regulating or even reconfiguring the relationship of human beings to nonhuman forms of life or material objects? Among the issues covered will be the logic of fable in La Fontaine, the poetics of the object practiced by Francis Ponge, the modern materialism of Yves Bonnefoy, the poetry of place in Guillevic, the vegetal lyric subject of Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, the terrestrial tropes of Marie-Claire Bancquart, the ethology of Vinciane Despret, and Anne Portugal\u2019s interest in technology.

We will examine a variety of educational institutions (such as chartered academies, female seminaries, Native American boarding schools, and freedpeople\u2019s schools), but we will give special attention to the rise of public education (the common school system), considering both why some Americans in the early republic thought that mandatory public schooling was essential and why others resisted it. We will also study the myriad ways that Americans were educated outside formal schooling, including apprenticeship and the \u201cbinding out\u201d of children, the lyceum and Chautauqua movements, libraries and reading societies, Sunday schools, settlement houses, and clandestine education under slavery. Along the way, we will pay particular attention to the ways in which educational practices and philosophies in the United States either exacerbated or mitigated social inequalities along the lines of gender, race, and class.

This course will not only \u201cdiscover history in China,\u201d but also situate China in a global context by discussing the flow of peoples, goods, and ideas into and out of China. After the Silk Road connecting the Eurasian continent declined with the end of the Pax Mongolica, China continued to be an engine of the Afro-Eurasia network and began to interact with the Americas. However, since the Great Divergence in the 1750s, China has scrambled to join a new international order. By analyzing the exchanges between China and other regions, students will understand how the concept of China was in flux and the dynamic role of China in the early modern world."

At the same time, it had to face a new international order and resituate its relationship with the rest of the world. In the era of revolutions and reforms, China was more than once at the crossroads, asking which direction it should take. It chose its paths to address not only domestic needs, but also the vicissitudes of international environments. In this course, we will examine travel diaries, missionary reports, maps, political treaties, literary compositions, and other documents produced by people from Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Through \u201cforeign\u201d eyes, we will explore a series of the \u201cold\u201d (e.g., demographical pressure and ethnic conflicts) and \u201cnew\u201d (e.g., high mobility of goods, capital, and people; urban-rural disparity; and environmental deterioration) questions that China has encountered and how it has responded to them. By focusing on non-Chinese sojourners and observers, we will think about how China becomes China and the role of China in the global era from an alternative perspective."

How did people in East Asia enter and exit from slavery? How were the human markets in East Asia operated locally and globally? How were family practices, such as adoption, marriage, and concubinage, entangled with slavery? How did Confucianism, the dominant ideology in premodern East Asia, conceptualize and legitimize the relationship between slaves and masters? What are modern forms of coerced labor in China, Japan, and Korea? How could the East Asian histories of slavery and human trade contribute to international efforts in combating unfree labor and human trafficking worldwide? At the end of our class, we will reflect on globalized concepts-such as freedom, coerced labor, and property rights-and their applications from non-Western perspectives."

How can the study of criminal justice and the law help us better understand medieval and early modern European societies and cultures? Through an analysis of law codes, court records, and other historical sources, this course will trace the development of criminal law and justice in premodern Europe. In particular, we will examine how medieval practices such as trial by ordeal, feuds, and the payment of blood prices (weregelds) gave way to more \u201crational\u201d processes, such as trial by jury, inquisitorial procedure, and the use of judicial torture. We will also discuss the importance of religious attitudes and community norms in shaping the practical application of criminal justice in this period, as well as Enlightenment efforts to standardize criminal justice, abolish torture, and eliminate capital punishment."

We will then move on to a series of more specific case studies that complicate these large-scale historical analyses. As we visit the pastoral landscapes of Nazi Germany, the toxic waters and fields of modern Japan, the denuded countryside of imperial China, and the socially stratified villages of northern India, we will see how culture, memory, religion, and power shape reciprocal relationships between humans and their geographically unique surroundings in a number of different ways. Finally, we will investigate how these different valances of environmental history have informed a twentieth-century regime of global environmental governance-a regime born of good intentions, but one replete with problems of efficacy, equitability, and justice."

U.S. involvement in the war in Vietnam was underway; after September 11, 2001, a war on terror would be waged. Women\u2019s labor force participation (including that of married women and married mothers) was on the rise. Americans grappled with grassroots protests and political partisanship, persistent economic inequality, divisive foreign policies, and the so-called culture wars. In 1964, network TV and national and local radio and newspapers provided entertainment and news; by 2004, digital technologies would democratize and fragment access to information.

As we build a deeper and more critical understanding of water as a natural, cultural, and political entity in American history, we will pay particular attention to the ways in which history has helped to shape the way we allocate and regulate water across a geographically and politically diverse continent. Armed with the dual weapons of history and basic legal doctrine, we will then begin to tackle some of the key issues in twentieth-century American water policy, starting with the Columbia and Colorado River basins. Looking toward the future, we will also explore the problems and potential solutions on the cutting edge of water politics both in the Colorado River basin and elsewhere, including groundwater policy, water marketing, and an extended discussion of the potential water implications of global warming."

This course will explore the turbulent, contested, and colorful history of wildlife in North America. It will span from the Pleistocene to the present and cover the entire continent. The goal of this course is for students to develop a sophisticated understanding of the changing relationships between people and wild animals over time. There are no easy answers for why things happened the way they did, and no simple lessons for what we should do in the future.

During this study tour, we will visit the major monuments and museums of the city, considering Rome\u2019s development from a small village (ca. 1000 BCE) to the Augustan age (first century BCE-first century CE) to the capital of a world empire (second-third centuries CE). Through site visits and lectures, students will examine the development of Rome\u2019s urban and monumental landscape, including religious, mortuary, and public architecture; learn how to interpret archaeological/architectural evidence and confront its difficulties; and consider the (ab)uses of the Roman past in the present, especially during the Fascist era, and how that has shaped the modern city. We will also visit the exceptionally well-preserved city of Ostia to examine aspects of urbanism and domestic life. Prior to the study tour during spring semester, students will be required to attend several mandatory class meetings (with readings), conduct research on a chosen site/monument, and prepare an oral presentation to be given on site in Italy."

This course will study the values and meanings given to the ancient Olympics by studying the representation of athletic victory in the poetry and dedications that celebrated victors. What ideas of athletic victory did these memorials produce? How did they link athletic success to moral excellence, natural talent, family history, masculinity, beauty, or divine favor, and build up these very notions so that they seemed real and significant? Who could claim the political capital of athletic excellence for their own-victors? Their cities? Second-place finishers? Non-Greeks? What events counted as events-women\u2019s events, team events, running with a shield, dog racing? And what kind of work even qualified you as a victor? Throughout we will use comparisons to the meanings that other sporting movements have sought to claim, and so we will take time to study Roman sports and the modern Olympic movement, again focusing on how various artistic forms (poetry, film, mass choreographed performances) construct victory. Course conducted in English."

Through a survey of textual evidence-the extant tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, as well as other testimonia-and material remains, we will familiarize ourselves with the literary and dramatic form of Greek tragic poetry and the circumstances of its performance. Through close reading of individual tragedies, we will identify what elements characterize and unite tragedy as a genre; analyze how tragedy makes use of myth (and, less often, history) to explore urgent questions about identity, difference and belonging, gender, power and obligation, death and loss, and survival; and consider the relationship of these texts and the questions they are concerned with to the historical, social, and political conditions under which they were performed. We will survey and evaluate approaches taken by critics, ancient and modern, to interpreting tragedy as literary texts, as civic religious ritual, and as performance. Time and interest permitting, we will consider how fifth-century BCE Athenian tragedy relates - or does not relate - to other tragic dramatic traditions, and modern uses and receptions of fifth-century BCE Athenian tragedies. All readings in English; no Greek or familiarity with Greek history required."

Global health presents itself as a timely intervention that redistributes the means of physical and mental well-being to those who lack it, typically in resource-poor or underserved settings. But in what sense is global health \u201cglobal\u201d if it is driven by the agendas of specific nations and institutions? How can it command such implicit recognition as a force for good and yet seem to recapitulate the imperial agendas and perspectives of the colonial era? Rather than considering global health as obvious, coherent, and necessary, we will examine its foundations: What assumptions does global health reflect about bodies, families, history, and biomedicine itself? In what ways do global health programs build upon or distinguish themselves from colonial-era medical campaigns that tied biomedical interventions to Christianity, modernization, and the demands of industrial labor? How does global health both reflect and perpetuate transnational political and economic shifts? What are the unexpected consequences of global health programs-for the individuals who compose target populations, but also for global health professionals themselves as well as local experts? In exploring answers to these questions, we will draw on recent ethnographic analyses from around the world as well as historical studies that illuminate global health\u2019s antecedents."

Understanding the forces driving this modern-day migration, and its effects on these Indigenous migrants, requires a historically situated understanding of Central American Indigeneity itself and its unique legacy within countries like Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. This course provides that historical background, beginning with the archaeology and ancient history of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and continuing through the conquest of the Americas to the present day. By focusing on topics such as Indigenous culture, social inequality, and religion, we will track historical currents through time and discuss what effect they continue to have today. From this framing, we will use a multimedia approach that includes films, excerpts of novels, ethnographies, photographs, and social media to access firsthand accounts of the topics discussed in class."

When and how do some people and issues become political, and when and how do they not? How and when are these movements successful in achieving their aims? What social, cultural, and political effects do they have beyond their explicit aims? How, finally, do these movements interact with existing state and legal structures, whether antagonistically or through participation and engagement? By examining South Asian social movements with a focus on India, this conference analyzes current and historical attempts to reconfigure the relationships between people, laws, and states. In the process, the conference engages with challenges facing anthropology in theorizing historical change and in finding methodologies suited to large- and multi-scaled social processes. South Asia, with its vast scale and its complex and constantly shifting political landscape, is both an ideal and an important site for these inquiries. This conference also serves as an introduction to the anthropology of South Asia. It begins with a historical and theoretical consideration of the play of domination and hegemony in the colonial period, moves to a study of nationalist movements in India and Bangladesh, and then draws on the theoretical frameworks studied in the beginning of the semester to consider a range of contemporary social movements, including the Indian Maoist uprising, Dalit and anticaste movements, and the Sri Lankan Civil War. This course asks what an anthropological approach to the specific and local can bring to the study of politics, and what a study of large-scale movements can bring to anthropological understandings of historical change."

These mass infections have also highlighted the strengths and weakness of different health systems, while also illustrating just how complex and unwieldy public health interventions can be. Even in supposedly \u201cdeveloped\u201d or \u201cwealthy\u201d countries, public health interventions in mass infections can exacerbate existing inequalities along lines of race, class, and gender, sharpen political antagonisms, prop up cronyism, erode existing health services by redirecting resources in ways that negatively impact public health in the process, and radically transform how individuals and groups regard themselves and others. Ethnographic research provides a critical vantage point for thinking about what health policy and health systems do and what they mean beyond their stated intentions and actions. Focusing on epidemics past, present, and future, this class will pose the following questions: What can ethnographic research illuminate about health systems, particularly health systems under immense strain? What do strategies implemented to respond to mass infections tell us about how public health policymakers view the world, and the historical and political contexts that give rise to these visions? In what ways must ethnographers modify their research methodologies to respond to outbreaks of infectious disease?

Drawing upon the analyses we build of ideologies, tactics, and historical conditions of the various political projects, we spend the second unit of the course reading ethnographic accounts of contemporary fascist and right-wing movements from India, Europe, and the United States. We end the semester with readings from contemporary antifascist movements, comparing their analyses with those that have emerged from our readings."

Those debates took on new urgency in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for Chinese intellectuals faced with the threat of Western colonialism, the imperative to establish a sovereign nation-state, and the concomitant rise of Western modernity discourses that were grounded in notions of essential biological differences hierarchizing human \u201craces.\u201d Yet since the emergence of the PRC as global power in the 2010s and President Xi Jinping\u2019s effort to extend Chinese infrastructure development and investment programs to over 70 countries worldwide, transnational China has seen reintensified debates about social difference and the meaning of Chineseness, as well as the rise of new mass-mediated Han Chinese nationalisms. In this course we engage multimedia sources (texts, videos, images) to explore these most recent debates in historical context. We do this as a way to dialogue with critical race theory, and to delve into the high-stakes interpretive politics of \u201crace\u201d and \u201cracism\u201d transnationally. As many Chinese scholars and netizens ask: are these English language terms even applicable in the very different cultural, historical, and political economic contexts of transnational China? We start with comparative theoretical debates about the nature of \u201crace\u201d as historically situated perceptions and claims about biological/embodied difference. We then turn to debates in recent Chinese contexts to consider for example the relationship between discourses of \u201crace\u201d and \u201cnation,\u201d the nature of \u201cHan-ness,\u201d the status of \u201cethnic minorities,\u201d and the status of \u201cBlackness\u201d amidst increased Sino-African engagement. Our goal will be to expand our understandings of the stakes and contexts of cosmologies and ontologies of social difference and inequality transnationally."

Meanwhile, tightening political constraints and rapid development under President Xi Jinping (2013-) have ushered in a new and complicated era for the transnational Tibetan community. Yet Tibet has long been both a cosmopolitan place and an object of translocal interest and desire. This course draws on visual and multimedia approaches in anthropology and media studies to understand the global roles of Tibet and Tibetans in specific historical and ethnographic contexts. We center the analysis and production of film and video as mediums for exploring ongoing, transnational debates about Tibetanness amidst rapid sociopolitical and economic change. The course pairs film screenings with relevant ethnographic and historical readings, as well as a variety of other media such as literature, popular songs, websites, and blogs from inside and outside of China. We focus on films, especially by Tibetan filmmakers, that address the historical and contemporary diversity among Tibetans across the Himalayan region and into the diaspora, as well as the changing political economic conditions of interethnic and Chinese-Tibetan relations. Students will propose, receive training in, and workshop a semester-long short film/video project about a film on Tibetans of their choice."

Since Deng Xiaoping\u2019s post-Mao reforms in the early 1980s, the PRC has been one of the fastest growing economies in the world. As such, it is poised to have major impacts globally, and especially since the PRC\u2019s entrance into the World Trade Organization in 2001, these meteoric socioeconomic changes have complex implications for its diverse 1.4 billion people, as well as for many communities abroad now impacted by the expanding reach of Chinese investment and development efforts. This course draws on anthropological theories of modernity, capitalism, globalization, and development to turn a critical eye on discourses and practices of \u201cdevelopment\u201d in the PRC. Drawing on theoretical, historical, and ethnographic writings, as well as on other media such as government policy papers, advertising, and documentary and feature films, we consider the contexts and contradictions of various development efforts just before, during, and after the Maoist period, focusing especially on the post-Mao era of economic reforms. The PRC thus will serve as a case study for our broader examination of theories conceptualizing the relationships among transregional capitalisms, changing forms of governance, and local communities\u2019 experiences."

Yet climate change, its effects, and the consequences of its mitigation strategies are experienced differently in different places and communities. As such, climate change evokes a curious moment, simultaneously reviving old inequalities, binaries, debates, tensions, divisions, and reflexes while presenting opportunities to transcend them and forge new collaborations and alliances. This course seeks to sociopolitically and spatiotemporally situate this moment by approaching climate change not as a singularity, but as a multiplicity: a complex, multifaceted, and heterogeneously distributed crisis with diverse voices and perspectives. By exploring a range of political, ecological, scientific, humanistic, and more-than-humanistic themes-such as the dichotomies of nature versus culture, facts versus fictions, science versus art, and \u201chard\u201d versus \u201csoft\u201d sciences, as well as the concepts of post-truth, technofix, and climate change mitigation as a neocolonial practice-this course aims to develop a transdisciplinary approach to better understand the climate crisis."

Scholars have examined natural resource management from international relations, geopolitical, or political economy perspectives for decades. Recent scholarship brings other critical approaches to bear on the discussions of environment and politics in the Mediterranean region. Focusing on this rising critical scholarship, we will elaborate on how water, oil, coal, land, forests, fisheries, agriculture, and solar energy - among others - are made into sources of political power at scales ranging from everyday life to national and transnational politics. By challenging the \u201cnaturalness\u201d of resources, we will reflect on what a natural resource is and how it connects with sociocultural practices, power relations, and historical processes. In this course, we will focus on the Mediterranean to explore themes and concepts such as colonialism, nationalism, power, resistance, access, scarcity, abundance, pollution, and temporality through the lenses of critical social studies on natural resources."

Drawing on the recent spate of theoretical literature, ethnographies, and award-winning films on globalization and capitalism at a variety of scales, discussions and written assignments will address some of the most pressing and conflictual issues facing humankind today.

In this course, we challenge this dichotomy of intimacy/immediacy versus estrangement/mediation by taking an anthropological approach to the question of human communication. Drawing on interdisciplinary debates in philosophy, linguistic anthropology, and media studies, we develop tools for understanding all communication as both mediated and material, grounded in embodied practices and technological infrastructures and situated in historical events. This in turn will allow us to grasp how circulations of media forms and commodities participate in the creation of types of persons and publics across multiple scales of time and space. Bringing those theoretical and methodological debates into dialogue with ethnographic studies and other forms of media, we ask: How do people sense and interpret themselves, others, and their worlds? What is the boundary between the human and nonhuman in a digital age? What roles do states or transregional capitalisms play in the mediation of valued and devalued persons and publics? What are the possibilities for communication amidst great gaps in access to valued forms of media?"

        "course_description": "Anthropologists have long been interested in humans\u2019 dynamic efforts to create multidimensional social worlds amid ongoing contestation. Yet early attempts to account for this cultural politics of world making were obscured in favor of conveniently static representations of bounded \u201ccultures\u201d or/as \u201craces,\u201d and dualistic understandings of sociocultural structures versus individual actions or intentions. This course considers \u201csemiotics,\u201d \u201cpragmatics,\u201d and \u201cperformance\u201d to be methodological rubrics that have grouped together a wide variety of social theorists who have focused instead on the emergent and contested nature of all meanings, persons, and places as they are interpreted in everyday and ritualized speech, practice, and performance. The course brings linguistic anthropological methodologies into dialogue with critical race theories since the early twentieth century to interrogate the possibilities and limits of anthropological world making in the face of Western theorists\u2019 complicities with modernist white supremacy. Moving from key foundational texts in the science and philosophy of language, social action, and subjectivity to more recent theoretical and ethnographic work, we rethink language and semiotics as social action, the nature of context and interpretive politics, the relationships between formal events or performances and everyday life, and the precarious, often violent creation of selves and others. By directing analytic focus to the indeterminacy, ambiguity, and multiplicity inherent to social life and weaponized or erased in racialized political economic orders, the course challenges students to reconsider some of the central issues in anthropological theory, such as agency, identity, power, and resistance."

Through ethnographic and science and technology studies (STS)-informed accounts across the globe on various topics such as health, toxicity, disasters, economics, safety, security, and climate, we will scrutinize the multifaceted aspects of risk. By examining competing social theories of risk, ethnographic studies of culturally diverse ways of assessing and managing risks, historical analyses of how risk emerges as a techno-political domain of intervention, and STS accounts of how risk expertise is created and circulated, this course divulges the polysemous, productive, and ultimately contentious life of risk."

Observing the things that populate, and the processes that make, the lived and known experience of anthropology\u2019s ethnographic subjects draws attention to contrasting knowledge regimes. Consideration of alternate ontologies allows Euro-modernity\u2019s \u201cothers\u201d articulation of their own bases of knowledge, logics of practice, and courses of action.

Students will use charcoal, colored pencils, and inks to make multimedia works on paper in the studio and in the field. Students will be able to articulate the relationship of these visual works to the conceptual foundations of the class."

We then turn to art production under Mao Zedong beginning in 1942, with his famous Talks on Literature and Art presented in Yan\u2019an, in which art became an integral part of his social and political platforms. From there, we examine the visual objects produced during and shortly after the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976.

Working from a multimedia art practice, we will consider the ways that power structures shape the environment. How do the hauntings from ongoing species extinctions impact us and what can we do about it? To do this work, we will draw on BioArt, feminist science, community ecology, and environmental policy to develop our individual and collective artistic research practices. We will consider the material histories involved in our art making and how those materials and practices can interrogate changing ecologies. We will expand our understandings of animism and kinship with the more-than-human world and question if artistic collaboration is possible with nonhumans. We will research, germinate, and caretake plants and other beings, focusing on those that have histories resisting oppression or as biomedicines. By expanding our ecological research as artists, we can illuminate new and vibrant ways to work within the environment."

With its advent in China more or less coeval with the beginning of the nation\u2019s modern chapter, cinema affords us a unique window to look into a diverse and rapidly changing China throughout the twentieth century and beyond. The films we watch in this class cover a broad range of topics: the woman question, family and gender, revolution, the urban/rural divide, economic reform and migrant labor, LGBTQ issues, health care and an aging population, etc. Through a combination of closely viewing, reading and writing, conference discussion and presentations (one collaborative), we\u2019ll familiarize ourselves with the historical and cultural contexts of these films\u2019 creation and representation, and identify values and attitudes expressed in them as well as the formal means of their expression. We will explore films made by critically acclaimed directors, such as Cai Chusheng, Chen Kaige, Zhang Yimou, Jiang Wen, Wang Xiaoshuai, Wang Bing, Jia Zhangke, Xu Anhua, and Wu Hao, among others.

Through closely reading select chapters of these four novels, we will explore the relationship between the Ming masterworks and a number of other factors, ranging from history (the long tradition of historiography in China as well as changes in intellectual history during Ming), the rise of material culture, shifting societal norms, and the growing focus on the individual, to more literary concerns with authorship, genre, intertextuality, and reception history. Close textual analyses of the primary sources will be supplemented by critical and theoretical readings that will introduce us to current scholarly approaches to the study of early modern Chinese fiction and help us dialogue with specialists in the field with our own interests and interpretations. We will also examine adaptations of these monumental novels in a variety of other popular media to appreciate their long-lasting cultural influences across (and beyond?) East Asia.

Through reading and discussion of poetry, drama, short story, and longer works of fiction from earlier periods alongside selected chapters from the novel, we will explore the ways in which The Story of the Stone self-consciously adapts literary conventions, techniques, and motifs from the narrative tradition, and learn to appreciate both China\u2019s rich literary tradition and the unique artistic achievements of this novel.

One such genre was science fiction, which became enormously popular in the Soviet Union starting in the mid-1950s. Relying on the rich tradition of the 1920s, the postwar writers and filmmakers used science fiction to reflect on urgent societal and philosophical issues. In the presence of state censorship and official ideology, science fiction became the venue for veiled and subversive critique of the regime. In this course, through reading and watching major works of Soviet and East European sci-fi fiction and cinema, we will explore how they imagined artificial intelligence and time travel; space exploration and alien species and transformations of gender and race; the quest for immortality; and the nuclear apocalypse. We will situate these works in their immediate artistic and cultural contexts and the wider, primarily American, comparative context of postwar science fiction. LIT courses conducted in English."

The responses have varied, ranging from early twentieth-century musical theater reconciling modern identities with \u201cdark continent\u201d stereotypes, to the cultural-political embrace of Afrocentricity in Sixties jazz and soul, to the Afro-diasporic parable of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2020 visual album Black Is King. This is not a course on music from the African continent. Rather, through suggestive musical examples and literature on such topics as Ethiopianism, African retentions, and the politics of origins, students will consider how and why Black musicians have persistently asserted and negotiated relationships with Africa-whether as a homeland or as a space of fantasy-and the fluidity of these relationship over time."

This course studies how women popular musicians in the sixties, along with their audiences, enacted these diversifying musical performances. Particularly influential for this multiplication of performance modes were seminal developments in second-wave feminism, the cresting civil rights movement, sixties counterculture, and transformations within the music industry. Students will cultivate skills for close listening to recordings and analysis of musical style, and will read literature by a range of scholars thinking through musicology, media studies, U.S. history, African American studies, feminist theory, and performance studies about such artists as Nina Simone, Janis Joplin, Joni Mitchell, the Supremes, Astrid Gilberto, Barbra Streisand, Loretta Lynn, Miriam Makeba, and others.

In this writing-intensive course, we will navigate these extremes via the study and practice of writing about music, from general descriptive writing to the many genres of music criticism, journalism, ethnography, memoir, and other creative nonfiction forms. Through conference-style discussion of exemplary work in these areas and regular peer workshopping of our in-progress writing projects, students will cultivate both a critical understanding and practical aptitude regarding the hows and whys of compelling writing about music."

Through close study of primary and secondary historical texts and musical repertory that will include the spiritual, jazz, and concert music, this course will explore ways in which ideas about musical sound and musical performance, from the end of the Civil War to the beginning of World War II, articulated the stakes of the Black freedom struggle and the meanings of freedom."

In Chinese history, these ideas definitely talked to one another, Buddhism upon its arrival first using Daoist understandings to express itself; in Chinese religion, Laozi and the Buddha were (and still are) literally worshipped side by side. Yet their first axioms about the nature of reality are differently nuanced. They\u2019re like two trees that have naturally grafted into one another in places (\u201cinosculation\u201d), becoming a single organism and yet maintaining separate roots at the same time. This course will examine the two ideas individually using their respective masterpieces in Chinese philosophy - the Dao via"

One such genre was science fiction, which became enormously popular in the Soviet Union starting in the mid-1950s. Relying on the rich tradition of the 1920s, the postwar writers and filmmakers used science fiction to reflect on urgent societal and philosophical issues. In the presence of state censorship and official ideology, science fiction became the venue for veiled and subversive critique of the regime. In this course, through reading and watching major works of Russian sci-fi fiction and cinema, we will explore how they imagined artificial intelligence and time travel; space exploration and alien species and transformations of gender and race; the quest for immortality; and the nuclear apocalypse. We will situate these works in their immediate artistic and cultural contexts and the wider, primarily American, comparative context of postwar science fiction. Readings and screenings from the Strugatsky brothers, Alexander Beliaev, Evgeny Zamyatin, Mikhail Bulgakov, Andrei Tarkovsky, Kir Bulychev, Sever Gansovsky, and others.

Topics include the rise and fall of the mass production corporation; the role of unions, ethnic enclaves, and employment networks in allocating resources; the effects of civil rights law on corporate practices; how the state, the law, and neighborhood associations shape segregation, housing market dynamics, and the differential accumulation of wealth; the nature of and transformations in the welfare state; and the role of nonprofit enterprise and small-business formation in shaping the fates of African Americans and other groups."

        "course_description": "Is money a self-propelling medium of exchange, solely about mundane financial calculations, transactions, and interests? Do we only use it to quantify various qualities into a standard metric to exchange them? What happens when money penetrates what is typically considered priceless, such as our norms, emotions, intimate relations, bodies, or nature? In today\u2019s world, it is common for various economic, legal, and social institutions to place financial values on things as profound as human life, death, blood, organs, justice, sexual or romantic partnerships, and wildlife. Does this exercise flatten, commodify, corrode, and corrupt, as many scholars, legalists, activists think it does? Or, does it operate interdependently with our moral principles, cultural practices, interpersonal relationships? Then, how can those supposed corrosive commodification practices, in reality, turn into meaningful relations within which our lives, values, and ties are construed, maintained, and shaped? This conference invites its participants to grapple with these fundamental problems and more. Drawing on neoclassic economic theory to its Marxist critics, critical socio-legal scholarship to moral philosophy, cultural studies to economic sociology, we\u2019ll delve deep into the social life of money. Thus, we\u2019ll examine money not merely as a financial instrument but with the social and cultural processes mediating its significance from within."

        "course_description": "This course invites its participants to treat politics as grounded in everyday life, as arising from power and agency, and as a medium of domination and change. It introduces key sociological debates on relations of power in which, as Karl Marx famously suggests, individuals generate their thinking and acting not as they please but under the restrictions of structural contexts and social inequalities. Those social forces, however, do not divest individuals from becoming agents. People almost always have potentials for resisting and changing. When, why, and how people realize these possibilities are undoubtedly central concerns of this class. But why people are resigned to and how they participate in their own domination are equally crucial. This course thus calls as much attention to those individualistic and collective forms of resistance as it does to their absence."

What meanings and practices serve to hide, normalize, or validate stratifications between individuals and social groups? What makes subordinate groups create subversive cultures in the struggle for community, dignity, and equity? This conference draws on cultural sociology to address all these questions and more. We start with classical texts, establishing key concepts (such as symbolic boundaries and intersectionality) in the field of study. We then focus on case studies tackling issues as diverse as elite education and privilege, poverty and social aids, economic restructuring and gentrification, sexual minorities and the city. Throughout these studies, we pay attention to the cultural processes within which class, gender, and race inequalities are rendered invisible or unproblematic and thus socially normalized. Further, we look at the process of contestation through which communities use social relations and cultural frames to defend themselves against top-down economic, social, and political changes."

Among the specific problems we cover are: With what concepts and methods can we explain the affinities between law and society? What are the sources, workings, and consequences of the law\u2019s legitimacy? How does the law reinforce or mitigate class, gender, and race-based inequalities? Who mobilizes the law-how and with what results? In grappling with these questions, we examine the law as constitutive of the status quo and social change."

Attention is paid to both interactionist and structuralist traditions in network analysis, and includes a focus on the core principles of balance and centrality, connectivity and clustering, power and hierarchy, and social structure writ large. Substantive topics include social mobility and stratification, group organization and mobilization, patterns of creativity and innovation, resource distributions, decision-making, the organization of movement and belief systems, conflict and cooperation, and strategic interaction. This course couples theoretical and substantive themes with methodological applications.

The answer depends on how we define capitalism. Is it simply a mode of production that exploits workers? Or do we understand it more broadly as a complex adaptive system that appropriates value through multiple forms of domination? What is the central logic of a capitalist economy? What are the origins of capitalism? We will begin to answer these questions by first exploring the analytical foundations of a capitalist economy: private property, wage labor, markets, competition and crisis. We will then debate key questions such as: What is the relationship between capitalism and freedom, between imperialism and capitalism? How do race and gender shape capitalism? How have tech behemoths like Google, Amazon and Facebook challenged the fundamental logic of capitalism as we know it, if at all? How does the rise of artificial intelligence complicate theories of capitalism? We will conclude by reflecting on the realities of capitalism, and what lies beyond it."

Modern states and representative governments have always depended on (and often pioneered) new enumerative techniques. The U.S. Census, for example, constructs the population as both an object to be managed and as a subject-\u201cThe People\u201d-amenable to representation. Elections harness aggregation to put representatives\u2019 claims to the test. Polls and crowd estimates seek to measure and articulate public opinion. Politicians, activists, and journalists build narratives out of numbers. We begin with a theoretical and historical overview of counting, along with allied practices of categorizing, classifying, and commensurating. In the abstract, counting appears relatively straightforward; in the political field it is contentious and consequential. Counts are technical and narrative achievements embedded in disciplinary fields, reliant on technologies and instruments, systems of registration and surveillance, and fragile networks of trust. We then turn to attempts to understand the elusive concept of representation, from Hobbes to contemporary democratic theorists. Finally, we examine the relationship between counting and representing across four sites: the census, public opinion polling, voting, and crowd estimation."
